Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, readers should carefully consider the following essential factors. These factors, among others, in some cases, have affected, and in the future could affect, our financial condition and results of operations and could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements that appear in this Form 10-K or that we have made or will make elsewhere.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following summarizes certain essential factors that may make our company\u2019s investment speculative or risky. You should carefully consider the full risk factor disclosure outlined in this Annual Report, in addition to the other information herein, including the section of this Report titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes.\n\u25cf Our financial statements included a disclosure regarding our liquidity and financial condition due to recurring operating losses and cash used from operations.\n\u25cf If we cannot comply with Nasdaq\u2019s applicable continued listing requirements or standards, Nasdaq could delist our Common Stock.\n\u25cf We face risks related to COVID-19, which could significantly disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on us and our business.\n\u25cf We may require additional capital in the future to develop and market new products. If we do not obtain any such additional financing, our business prospects, financial condition, and operating results will be adversely affected if required.\n\u25cf Our industry is highly competitive, and we may not compete effectively.\n\u25cf Defects or errors in our products and services or products made by our suppliers could harm our brand and relations with our customers and expose us to liability. If we experience product recalls, we may incur significant expenses and experience decreased demand for our products.\n\u25cf We acknowledge material weaknesses in the controls and procedures of our financial reporting. We may identify additional material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, including timeliness, or result in material misstatements of our financial statements.\n\u25cf We rely on key executive officers, and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace.\n\u25cf We purchase some components, subassemblies, and products from a limited number of suppliers. The loss of these suppliers may substantially disrupt our ability to obtain orders and fulfill sales as we design and qualify new components.\n\u25cf Our intellectual property protections may be insufficient to safeguard our technology appropriately.\n\u25cf We may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or invalidity. Expenses incurred concerning monitoring, protecting, and defending our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf Enforcement of our intellectual property rights abroad, particularly in China, is limited, and it is often difficult to protect and enforce such rights.\n\u25cf The intellectual property rights of others may prevent us from developing new products or entering new markets.\n\u25cf We may be subject to infringement claims in the future.\n\u25cf If our technology did not work and planned or were unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or penetrating new markets, our business and operating results would suffer.\n\u25cf Demand for our defense-related products and products for emergency response services depends on government spending.\n\u25cf Regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and impending prospects.\n\u25cf New regulations or standards or changes in existing laws or standards in the United States or internationally related to our products may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and future sales, and could place additional burdens on the operations of our business.\n\u25cf Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, and we must make substantial investments in new products, services, and technologies to compete successfully.\n\u25cf At several of our annual stockholder meetings we failed to obtain ratification by our stockholders of specific proposals submitted for approval of our stockholders at prior annual meetings, which could be deemed defective corporate acts.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has unfavorably affected the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and operating results and could affect the Company\u2019s liquidity. We cannot predict, with any certainty, how future events may affect our operations in the near and long-term in the COVID-19 pandemic environment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the continued measures to reduce its spread have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer/customer demand and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and financial markets disruption. These measures and the continued volatility of the worldwide economy adversely affected our results of operations for 2022.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business remains uncertain and will depend on various changing factors on a day-to-day basis. We may not be able to predict such items accurately as:\n\u25cf the duration and scope of the pandemic,\n\u25cf the disruption of the national and global economy,\n\u25cf the span of the economic downturn,\n\u25cf the laws, programs, actions, and vaccine mandate that federal, state, and local governments will enact or take,\n\u25cf the possibility to which our clients\u2019 businesses contract or fail,\n\u25cf the applicability to which new regulations intended to help small and medium-sized businesses,\n\u25cf the extent to which our operations are impacted by facility closures, remote work and/or infections,\n\u25cf and how quickly and to what time normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nAny of these factors could exacerbate the risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company fully implemented a strategic initiative plan during the first quarter of 2020. We executed spending reductions to improve liquidity, a partial workforce reduction, the furlough of employees, and discretionary spending reduction. The Company continued its focus in November 2020, further reducing the workforce, eliminating inventory related to discontinued product lines, reducing individual facilities usage, and reducing operations expenditures.\nRisks Related to the Company and Our Business\nOur financial statements have included our liquidity and financial condition disclosures due to our recurring operating losses and cash used from operations.\nThe Company incurred an approximate $17.7 million loss from operations and $9.6 million of cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company had $50.7 million in working capital, $286.5 million in accumulated deficits, and $36.2 million of cash on hand as of December 31, 2021.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements assuming we can continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations by realizing assets and settling liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the receipt of the proceeds from previous capital raises, reduction of debt, and our cost-reduction initiatives, we may lack adequate financial resources to generate cash from operations because, among other reasons, our ability to recognize revenue and ultimately cash receipts is contingent upon, but not limited to, acceptable performance of the delivered equipment and services.\nWe face risks related to COVID-19, which could significantly disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on us and our business.\nThe enduring effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the advent of Delta and Omicron variants, plus the uncertainty of possible future variants, may subject the Company to particular challenges of its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The timing and efficacy of the vaccination programs in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and the actions implemented to contain the impact of COVID-19 by Federal and local governments, limit determining the foreseeable resulting economic effects with any level of predictability.\nWe may require additional capital in the future to develop and market new products. If we do not obtain any such additional financing, our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected if required.\nWe may require additional capital in the future to develop new products, and we may not be able to secure adequate additional financing when needed on acceptable terms or at all. To execute our business strategy, we may issue additional equity securities in public or private offerings, potentially at discounts to the current or future market price of our Common Stock. If we cannot secure additional funding, we may be forced to forego strategic opportunities or delay, scale back and eliminate future product development.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we may not compete effectively.\nThe communications industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and constant technological change. We expect that new competitors are likely to join existing competitors. Many of our competitors may be larger and have more excellent financial, technical, operational, marketing, and other resources and experience than we do. If a competitor expends significant resources, we may not compete successfully. Also, the pace of technological change makes it impossible for us to predict whether we will face new competitors using different technologies to provide products. If our competitors were to offer better and more cost-effective products than our products, we might not be able to capture any significant market share.\nDefects or errors in our products and services or products made by our suppliers could harm our brand and relations with our customers and expose us to liability. If we experience product recalls, we may incur significant expenses and experience decreased demand for our products.\nOur products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors that are only detectable when the products are in use. Because our products are used for personal and business purposes, such faults or errors could have a severe impact on our end customers, damaging our reputation, harming our customer relationships, and exposing us to liability. Defects or impurities in our components, materials or software, equipment failures, or other difficulties could adversely affect our ability and that of our customers, ship products on a timely basis, and customer or licensee demand for our products. Any shipment delays or declines in demand could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or sustain desired levels of profitability. Our customers may also experience component or software failures or defects that could require significant product recalls, rework, and/or repairs that are not covered by warranty reserves.\nWe acknowledge material weaknesses in the controls and procedures of our financial reporting. We may identify additional material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, including timeliness, or result in material misstatements of our financial statements. If we continue to remediate our material weaknesses or implement effective controls and procedures for our financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected, which would likely adversely affect the value of our Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is a process designed by and under the supervision of the Company\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company\u2019s Board, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes under generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements following generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only by authorizations of its management and Board; and\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and our chief financial officer, has not completed an adequate assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) framework. Management has concluded that as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective in detecting U.S. GAAP\u2019s inappropriate application.\nManagement identified the following material weaknesses set forth below in our internal control over financial reporting:\n\u25cf We did not perform an adequate risk assessment or monitor internal controls over financial reporting.\n\u25cf With the acquisitions of IMT, Vislink, and MVP, there are risks related to the timing and accuracy of integrating information from various accounting and ERP systems. The Company has experienced delays in receiving information promptly from its subsidiaries.\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic delayed integrating the accounting and finance functions, enacted workforce reduction, and limited essential accounting personnel.\nThe Company remains committed to addressing this issue despite the effects on the worldwide economy caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate the current circumstances, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of highly experienced external legal and accounting professionals, including our limited number of essential accounting personnel, who continue to work from home. The Company expects to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework as the Company grows.\nUntil we can remediate this situation, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial statements, which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements. The Company expects improvements, as resources permit, on the integration of information issues in the fiscal year 2022 as we plan to move towards a more unified accounting and enterprise resource planning system.\nWe are in the process of designing and implementing measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses related to our financial reporting as of the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020. The Company is affecting the following:\n\u25cf additional review procedures within our accounting and finance department,\n\u25cf the hiring of additional accounting and compliance staff when financial resources permit,\n\u25cf implement application controls in our accounting system,\n\u25cf engaging consultants to assist us in documenting and improving our system of internal controls, and\n\u25cf implementing a suitable accounting framework.\nOur remediation efforts are ongoing, and these material weaknesses have not been revised. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will not experience other material weaknesses in the future.\nSuppose we cannot conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. In that case, our independent registered public accounting firm may not issue an unqualified opinion or may cause us to be untimely concerning our reporting obligations. If we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. We will not fully correct the identified material weaknesses until the ongoing steps described above are effectively attained and operating efficiently for an appropriate time.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and reduce our Common Stock\u2019s market price.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation (\u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and our Bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in our Company\u2019s control. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u25cf authorizing the Board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our Common Stock;\n\u25cf limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u25cf they require advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nAlso, the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL govern us. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, particularly those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a specific time without our Board\u2019s consent. These and other provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock and result in the market price of our Common Stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nAlthough our products may not cause users technical issues, our business and reputation may be harmed if users perceive our solutions to cause a slow or unreliable network connection or a high-profile network failure.\nWe expect our products to be in many different locations and user environments and can provide transmission of video, mobile broadband connectivity, and interference mitigation, among other applications. Our products\u2019 ability to operate effectively can be negatively impacted by many different elements unrelated to our products. Although our products may not cause users technical issues, users often may perceive the underlying cause of our technology\u2019s poor performance. This perception, even if incorrect, could harm our business and reputation. Similarly, a high-profile network failure may be caused by improper operation of the network or failure of a network component that we did not supply. Still, other service providers may perceive that our products were implicated, which, even if incorrect, could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur ability to sell our products will be highly dependent on the quality of our support and service offerings, and our failure to offer high-quality support and services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nOnce our products are deployed, our channel partners and end customers will depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our products. A high level of support will be necessary for our products\u2019 successful marketing and sale. In many cases, our channel partners will likely provide support directly to our end customers, and we will not have complete control over the quality of the support supplied by our channel partners. These channel partners may also support other third-party products, potentially distracting resources from support for our products. Suppose our channel partners do not effectively assist our end-customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our end-customers quickly, resolve post-deployment issues or provide adequate ongoing support. In that case, our ability to sell our products to existing end-customers could be adversely affected, and our reputation with potential end-customers could be harmed. In some cases, we guarantee a certain performance level to our channel partners and end customers, which could prove resource-intensive and expensive to fulfill if unforeseen technical problems arise.\nWe are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks which may adversely affect our performance.\nWhile we attempt to offset increases in operating costs through various measures focused on increasing revenues, there is no assurance that we will do so. Therefore, operating expenses may rise faster than associated revenues resulting in a material adverse impact on our cash flow and margins.\nWe are also impacted by inflationary increases in wages and benefits, whether driven by competition for talent or ordinary course pay increases and other rising costs. Increases in the rate of inflation could also significantly impact our cost base. In all countries in which we operate, wage inflation, whether driven by competition for talent or ordinary course pay increases, may also increase our cost of providing services and reduce our profitability if we are not able to pass those costs on to our clients or charge premium prices when justified by market demand.\nWe are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks which may adversely affect our performance.\nWhile we attempt to offset increases in operating costs through various measures focused on increasing revenues, there is no assurance that we will do so. Therefore, operating expenses may rise faster than associated revenues resulting in a material adverse impact on our cash flow and margins.\nWe are also impacted by inflationary increases in wages and benefits, whether driven by competition for talent or ordinary course pay increases and other rising costs. Increases in the rate of inflation could also significantly impact our cost base. In all countries in which we operate, wage inflation, whether driven by competition for talent or ordinary course pay increases, may also increase our cost of providing services and reduce our profitability if we are not able to pass those costs on to our clients or charge premium prices when justified by market demand.\nWe may fail to recruit and retain qualified personnel.\nWe expect to rapidly expand our operations and grow our sales, development, and administrative functions. This expansion is expected to place a significant strain on our management and require hiring a considerable quantity of qualified personnel. Accordingly, recruiting and retaining such personnel in the future will be critical to our success. There is intense competition from other companies for qualified personnel in our activities. Suppose we fail to identify, attract, retain and motivate this highly skilled personnel. In that case, we may be unable to continue our marketing and development activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe rely on key executive officers, and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace.\nWe are highly dependent on our executive officers because of their expertise and experience in the telecommunications industry. We have agreements with our executive officers containing customary non-disclosure, non-compete, confidentiality, and assignment of inventions provisions. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies for our officers. The loss of any of our key personnel\u2019s technical knowledge and management and industry expertise could result in delays in product development, loss of customers and sales, and diversion of management resources, adversely affecting our operating results.\nWe purchase some components, subassemblies, and products from a limited number of suppliers. The loss of these suppliers may substantially disrupt our ability to obtain orders and fulfill sales as we design and qualify new components.\nWe sometimes rely on third-party components and technology to build and operate our products, and until full integration with IMT and VCS, we may rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain the parts, subassemblies, and products necessary for the manufacture of our products. Shortages in components that we use in our products are possible, and our ability to predict such components\u2019 availability is limited. While parts and supplies are generally available from various sources, our contract manufacturers currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several pieces for our products. If our suppliers of these components or technology were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of wireless networking equipment or were to discontinue providing such components and technology to us, and we were unable to replace them cost-effectively, or at all, our ability to provide our products would be impaired. Our contract manufacturers generally rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with these suppliers.\nAdditionally, specific supply chain disruptions may arise, such as the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, trade sanctions, and similar events. It may be difficult for us to assess the ability of our suppliers to timely meet our demand in the future based on past performance. As a result, even if available, our contract manufacturers and we may not secure sufficient components at reasonable prices or acceptable quality to build our products on time. Therefore, we may be unable to meet customer demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with our existing contract manufacturers. The loss of any of our current contract manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with our existing contract manufacturers. If any of our current contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in the future, the loss of such contract manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur intellectual property protections may be insufficient to safeguard our technology adequately.\nGiven the rapid pace of innovation and technological change within the wireless and broadband industries, our personnel, consultants, and contractors\u2019 technical and creative skill and ability to develop, enhance, and market new products and upgrades to existing products are critical to continued success. Our success and ability to compete effectively depend on the proprietary technology that we have developed internally. We rely primarily on patent laws to protect our proprietary rights. As of December 31, 2021, in the United States, we have 28 patents granted, no patent applications pending, and no provisional applications pending. Internationally, we have six patents granted and no patent applications pending. There can be no assurance that patents awaiting or future patent applications will be issued or that we would have the resources to protect any such issued patent from infringement if issued.\nFurther, we cannot patent much critical technology to our business. To date, we have relied on copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, non-compete and/or work for hire invention assignment agreements, and licensing arrangements with our employees, consultants, contractors, customers, and vendors, to establish and protect our rights to this technology and, to the best extent possible, control the access to and distribution of our technology, software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use this technology without authorization. Policing unauthorized use of this technology is challenging. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of or prevent unauthorized third parties from obtaining or using the technology we rely upon. Also, adequate protection may be unavailable or limited in some jurisdictions. Litigation may be necessary for the future to enforce or protect our rights.\nWe may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or invalidity. Expenses incurred for monitoring, protecting, and defending our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nCompetitors and others may infringe on our intellectual property rights or allege that we have infringed on theirs. Monitoring infringement and misappropriation of intellectual property can be difficult and expensive, and we may not be able to detect infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights. We may also incur significant litigation expenses in protecting our intellectual property or defending our use of intellectual property, reducing our ability to fund product initiatives. These expenses could hurt our future cash flows and results of operations. If we are found to infringe on others\u2019 rights, we could be required to discontinue offering certain products or systems, pay damages, or purchase a license to use the intellectual property in question from its owner. Litigation can also distract management from the day-to-day operations of the business.\nEnforcement of our intellectual property rights abroad, particularly in China, is limited, and it is often difficult to protect and enforce such rights.\nPatent protection outside the United States is generally not as comprehensive as in the United States and may not protect our intellectual property in some countries where our products are sold or may be sold in the future. Even if patents are granted outside the United States, effective enforcement may not be available in those countries. Many companies have encountered substantial intellectual property infringement in countries where we sell, or intend to sell, products or have our products manufactured.\nIn particular, the legal regime relating to China\u2019s intellectual property rights is limited, and it is often difficult to protect and enforce such rights. The regulatory scheme for implementing China\u2019s intellectual property laws may not be as developed as other countries\u2019 regulatory schemes. Any advancement of an intellectual property enforcement claim through China\u2019s regulatory system may require an extensive amount of time, allowing intellectual property infringers to continue mostly unimpeded, to our commercial detriment in the Chinese and other export markets. Also, rules of evidence may be unclear, inconsistent, or difficult to comply with, making it difficult to prove infringement of our intellectual property rights. As a result, enforcement cases involving technology, such as copyright infringement of software code, or unauthorized manufacture or sale of products containing patented inventions, may be difficult or not possible to sustain.\nThese factors may make it increasingly complicated for us to enforce our intellectual property rights against parties misappropriating or copying our technology or products without our authorization, allowing competing enterprises to harm our business in the Chinese or other export markets by affecting the pricing for our products, reducing our sales and diluting our brand or product quality reputation.\nThe intellectual property rights of others may prevent us from developing new products or entering new markets.\nThe telecommunications industry is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies, which requires us to continuously introduce new products and expand into new markets that may be created. Therefore, our success depends on our ability to adapt our products and systems continue to incorporate new technologies and expand into markets that new technologies may create. If technologies are protected by others\u2019 intellectual property rights, including our competitors, we may be prevented from introducing new products or expanding into new markets created by these technologies. If others\u2019 intellectual property rights prevent us from taking advantage of innovative technologies, our financial condition, operating results, or prospects may be harmed.\nWe may be subject to infringement claims in the future.\nWe may be unaware of filed patent applications and issued patents that could include claims covering our products. Parties making claims of infringement may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to sell or supply our products or license our technology and could cause us to pay substantial royalties, licensing fees, or damages. The defense of any lawsuit could divert management\u2019s efforts and attention from ordinary business operations and result in time-consuming and expensive litigation, regardless of the merits of such claims. These outcomes may (i) require us to stop selling products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property; (ii) need us to redesign those products that have the allegedly infringing intellectual property; (iii) require us to pay substantial damages to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; (iv) result in the loss of existing customers or prohibit the acquisition of new customers; (v) cause us to attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; (vi) materially and adversely affect our brand in the market place and cause a substantial loss of goodwill; (vii) cause our stock price to decline significantly; (viii) materially and adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay debts and other obligations as they become due; or (ix) lead to our bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party licenses. If these licenses are available only on less favorable terms or not at all in the future, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nWe have incorporated third-party licensed technology into our products. It may be necessary to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or seek additional licenses for existing or new products. There can be no assurance that the required licenses will be available on acceptable terms or at all. The inability to obtain specific licenses or other rights, or to obtain those licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could result in delays in product releases until such time, if ever, as equivalent technology could be identified, licensed or developed and integrated into our products and might have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.\nWe expect to base our inventory purchasing decisions on our forecasts of customers\u2019 demand, and if our forecasts are inaccurate, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nAs our customer base increases, we expect to place orders with our contract manufacturers based on our customers\u2019 demand forecasts. Our forecasts will be based on multiple assumptions, each of which may cause our estimates to be inaccurate, affecting our ability to provide products to our customers. When demand for our products increases significantly, we may not be able to meet demand on a timely basis, and we may need to expend a significant amount of time working with our customers to allocate limited supply and maintain positive customer relations, or we may incur additional costs to rush the manufacture and delivery of other products. If we underestimate customers\u2019 demand, we may forego revenue opportunities, lose market share, and damage customer relationships. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we may purchase more inventory than we can sell at any given time or at all. Also, we grant our distributors stock rotation rights, which require us to accept stock back from a distributor\u2019s inventory, including obsolete inventory. As a result of our failure to correctly estimate the demand for our products, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, resulting in a decline in our inventory value, which would increase our costs of revenues and reduce our liquidity. Our failure to accurately manage inventory relative to demand would adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our technology did not work and planned or were unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or penetrating new markets, our business and operating results would suffer.\nOur success and ability to compete depend on technology that we have developed or may develop in the future. There is a risk that the technology that we have developed or may develop may not work as intended or that the marketing of the technology may not be as successful as anticipated. Further, the markets in which our customers and we compete or plan to compete are characterized by regularly and rapidly changing technologies and technological obsolescence. Our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market, and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis to keep pace with market needs and satisfy customers\u2019 demands. A fundamental shift in technologies in any of our target markets could harm our competitive position within these markets. Our failure to anticipate these shifts, develop new technologies, or react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products, resulting in product obsolescence, decreased revenue, and a loss of customer wins to our competitors. New technologies and products generally require substantial investment and long development and testing periods before being commercially viable. We intend to continue to make significant investments in developing new technologies and products, and it is possible that we may not successfully be able to build or acquire new products or product enhancements that compete effectively within our target markets or differentiate our products based on functionality, performance or cost and that our latest technologies and products will not result in meaningful revenue. Any delays in developing and releasing new or enhanced products could cause us to lose revenue opportunities and customers. Any technical flaws in product releases could diminish our products\u2019 innovative impact and harm customer adoption and reputation. If we fail to introduce new products that meet our customers\u2019 demands or target markets, do not achieve market acceptance, or fail to penetrate new markets, our revenue will not increase over time, and our operating results and competitive position will suffer.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks.\nWe rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including developing new business opportunities and digital streaming products and services. Our business operations depend on secure transmission and other data and video processing over the internet and interconnected systems. Malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, ransomware, worms, and other destructive or disruptive software and other attempts to gain access to confidential or personal data, denial of service attacks, and other malicious activities are becoming increasingly diverse and sophisticated, and the incidence of these events is on the rise worldwide and highlights the need for continual and effective cybersecurity awareness and education. Our business, which involves the collection, use, transmission, and other distribution of data and video, may make us and our clients and business partners attractive targets of hackers, denial of service attacks, malicious code, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, and other threat actors, including malicious insiders (such as employees and prior employees), which may result in security incidents, including the unauthorized access, misuse, loss, corruption, inaccessibility, or destruction of this data (including personal, confidential and sensitive information), unavailability of services, or other adverse events. We have in the past faced cyber-attacks of this nature, and we expect to continue to face such attacks in the future. Some of these attacks have been successful, although none to date have been material. We can provide no guarantee that our defensive measures will prevent such attacks in the future. These types of cyber-attacks and incidents can give rise to various losses and costs, including legal exposure and regulatory fines, damages to reputation, and others. If successful, these incidents could also materially disrupt operational systems and result in loss of intellectual property, trade secrets, other proprietary or competitively sensitive information, and general data (including personal information).\nData breaches and improper use of social media by employees and others may risk sensitive data, such as personal information, strategic plans, and trade secrets, exposed to third parties or the general public. Any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability, be expensive to remedy, result in a loss of our or our clients\u2019 or vendors\u2019 proprietary information and damage our reputation. Efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not successfully prevent these events from occurring, and may require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and cyberattack techniques change frequently or are not recognized until successful.\nFurthermore, computer malware, viruses, hacking, and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may occur in our future systems. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers.\nRegulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and prospects.\nThe traditional telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the Internet telecommunications industry. Currently, there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on intellectual property networks, but future regulations could include sales taxes and tariffs in previously unregulated areas and provider access charges. We could be adversely affected by the regulation of intellectual property networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service or content providers. Rules governing the range of services and business models that service providers or content providers can offer could adversely affect those customers\u2019 needs for products designed to enable a wide range of such services or business models. For instance, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) has issued regulations governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks. These regulations might impact service provider and content provider business models and providers\u2019 needs for Internet telecommunications equipment and services. Also, many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection, which could affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment.\nEnvironmental regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations may adversely impact our business and financial condition. For instance, the European Union has adopted electronic waste, e-waste, e-scrap, or waste electrical and electronic equipment, Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals. Furthermore, some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified indigenous certification criteria even though those criteria may conflict with accepted international standards. Similar regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business.\nAdopting and implementing such regulations could decrease demand for our products, increase the cost of building and selling our products, impact our ability to ship products into affected areas, and recognize revenue on time. Any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAt several of our annual stockholder meetings, including our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we failed to obtain ratification by our stockholders of specific proposals submitted for approval of our stockholders at prior annual meetings, which could be deemed defective corporate acts.\nAt our 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our Board submitted to our stockholders for their approval (i) a proposal to approve our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and (ii) a proposal to approve our 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan. At our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our Board submitted to our stockholders for their approval (i) a proposal to approve our 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and (ii) a proposal to approve our 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan. At our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our Board submitted to our stockholders, for their approval, (i) a proposal to approve an amendment to our 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of Common Stock available for sale under such plan; (ii) a proposal to approve an amendment to our 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan to increase the number of shares of Common Stock available for sale under such plan; and (iii) a proposal to approve our 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan.\nAt each of these annual meetings, our inspector of elections determined that the applicable proposal received the requisite stockholder approval under our amended and restated bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) and certified that the proposal passed, which was subsequently disclosed in an applicable Current Report on Form 8-K. Questions have been raised about whether the votes on such proposals were tabulated following our Bylaws\u2019 provisions and whether the requisite number of votes were obtained to approve each of these proposals.\nAccording to the provisions of Section 204 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d) and to continue to remain in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Rules, we submitted all of these proposals, again, to our stockholders at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders for ratification to resolve any defects in the corporate acts relating to the approval of these proposals by our stockholders at the prior meetings. We could not obtain ratification by our stockholders for any of these proposals submitted to them at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Although we intend to resubmit these proposals to our stockholders for ratification, there can be no assurance that any of these proposals will be ratified. Suppose we cannot secure such ratifications secured or are not deemed adequate, among other consequences. In that case, this could result in a determination that none of the shares issued by us under these plans were duly authorized and validly issued, which could create accounting issues, affect our liquidity and capital structure, and expose us to claims from recipients of any stock awards granted according to such plans, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and its Regulatory Context\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, and we must make substantial investments in new products, services, and technologies to compete successfully.\nNew technological innovations generally require a substantial investment before they are commercially viable. We intend to continue to make significant investments in developing new products and technologies, and it is possible that our development efforts will not be successful and that our new technologies will not result in meaningful revenues. Our future success will depend on our ability to quickly develop and introduce new products, technologies, and enhancements. Our future success will also depend on our ability to keep pace with technological developments, protect our intellectual property, satisfy customer requirements, meet customer expectations, price our products and services competitively, and achieve market acceptance. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products and technologies and products and technologies currently under development obsolete and unmarketable. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments or customer requirements or experience any significant delays in development, introduction, or shipment of our products and technologies in commercial quantities, demand for our products and our customers\u2019 and licensees\u2019 products that use our technologies could decrease, and our competitive position could be damaged.\nNew regulations or standards or changes in existing laws or standards in the United States or internationally related to our products may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and future sales, and could place additional burdens on the operations of our business.\nOur products may be subject to governmental regulations in a variety of jurisdictions. To achieve and maintain market acceptance, our technology and products will have to comply with these regulations and a significant number of industry standards. In the United States, our technology and products will have to comply with various FCC rules and others. We may also have to comply with similar international regulations. For example, our wireless communication products operate through the transmission of radio signals, and radio emissions are subject to regulation in the United States and other countries in which we intend to do business. In the United States, various federal agencies, including the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the Food and Drug Administration, the FCC, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and various state agencies, have promulgated regulations that concern the use of radio/electromagnetic emissions standards. Member countries of the European Union have enacted similar standards concerning electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility and emissions and chemical substances and use standards.\nAs these regulations and standards evolve, and if new rules or standards are implemented, we may be required to modify our technology or products or develop and support new versions. Our compliance with these regulations and standards may become more burdensome. The failure of technology or our products to comply, or delays in compliance, with the various existing and evolving industry regulations and standards could prevent or delay the introduction of our technology or products, which could harm our business. End-customer uncertainty regarding future policies may also affect demand for communications products, including our products. Moreover, channel partners or end-customers may require us, or we may otherwise deem it necessary or advisable, to alter our technology or products to address actual or anticipated changes in the regulatory environment. Our inability to change our technology or products to address these requirements and any regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nCompliance with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including new regulations requiring higher standards, may increase our costs, limit our ability to utilize supply chains, and force design changes to our products.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations and equivalent local, state, and regulatory agencies in each jurisdiction we currently operate or may operate in the future. Our products\u2019 manufacturing uses substances regulated under various federal, state, and local laws governing the environment and worker health and safety. If we, including any contract manufacturers that we may employ, do not comply with these laws, including any new regulations, such non-compliance could reduce our products\u2019 net realizable value, which would result in an immediate charge to our income statements. Our non-compliance with such laws could also negatively impact our operations and financial position as a result of fines, penalties that may be imposed on us, and increase the cost of mandated remediation or delays to any contract manufacturers we may utilize; thus, we may suffer a loss of revenues, be unable to sell our products in specific markets and/or countries, be subject to penalties and enforced fees and/or suffer a competitive disadvantage. Costs to comply with current laws and regulations and/or similar future laws and regulations, if applicable, could include costs associated with modifying our products, recycling and other waste processing costs, legal and regulatory costs, and insurance costs. We cannot assure you that the costs to comply with these new laws or with current and future environmental and worker health and safety laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nGovernmental regulations affecting the import or export of products or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues.\nThe United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements, and restrictions on importing or exporting some technologies, especially encryption technology. Also, governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology from time to time, such as requiring certification, notifications, review of source code, or the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys. For example, Russia and China recently have implemented new requirements relating to encryption products, and India has imposed certain warranties and other obligations associated with critical technology. Governmental regulation of encryption or IP networking technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales prospects and adversely affect our revenue expectation. In addition, numerous sanctions and restrictions have been imposed on the exports of specific goods and services to Russia due to the armed conflict with Ukraine. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in penalties, costs, and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or government-funded projects.\nIf wireless devices pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and demand for our products and our licensees and customers may decrease.\nIn recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods for evaluating radiofrequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless phones and other wireless devices. Concerns over the effects of radiofrequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless devices, which may decrease demand for our products and those of our licensees and customers. Interest groups have also requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communication technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids, and medical devices. Concerns have also been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with wireless devices while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in response to these expressions of concern could reduce demand for our products and those of our licensees and customers in the United States and foreign countries.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of our Common Stock at or above the price you paid.\nOur Common Stock trading price could be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in the other \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Report on Form 10-K.\nAlso, the stock markets in general and the markets for telecommunication stocks have experienced volatility. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our Common Stock. In the past, when the market price has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the case, and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business, which could seriously harm our financial position. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nIf we cannot comply with Nasdaq\u2019s applicable continued listing requirements or standards, Nasdaq could delist our Common Stock.\nWe currently list our Common Stock on Nasdaq. To maintain such a listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price, and specific corporate governance requirements. According to Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2), we must maintain a closing bid price for our common stock of at least $1.00 per share. If our common stock stayed below $1.00 per share, our common stock would be at risk of delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. Such a delisting would have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, impair the ability to sell or purchase our common stock when persons wish to do so, and any delisting could materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic financing or other transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could have different negative results, including the potential loss of institutional investor interest.\nThere can be no assurances that we will maintain and comply with the applicable listing standards. If we cannot abide by these Nasdaq requirements, our Common Stock will be delisted from Nasdaq.\nIf our Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq, U.S. broker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in shares of our Common Stock because they may be considered penny stocks and thus be subject to the penny stock rules.\nThe SEC has adopted several rules to regulate \u201cpenny stock\u201d that restrict transactions involving stock deemed penny stock. Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. These rules may have the effect of reducing the liquidity of penny stocks. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on Nasdaq if the exchange or system provides current price and volume information concerning transactions in such securities). Our shares of Common Stock have in the past constituted, and may again in the future constitute, \u201cpenny stock\u201d within the meaning of the rules. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon U.S. broker-dealers may discourage such broker-dealers from effecting transactions in shares of our Common Stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of such shares of Common Stock and impede their sale in the secondary market.\nA U.S. broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or \u201caccredited investor\u201d (generally, an individual with a net worth above $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse) must make a unique suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction before a sale unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. Also, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations require the U.S. broker-dealer to deliver, before any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a disclosure schedule prepared under SEC standards relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A U.S. broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the U.S. broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a U.S. broker-dealer is required to submit monthly statements disclosing recent price information concerning the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in a customer\u2019s account and information for the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d\nAccording to the SEC, stockholders should be aware that the market for \u201cpenny stocks\u201d has suffered from patterns of fraud and abuse in recent years. Such practices include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) \u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced salespersons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to the desired level, resulting in investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to dictate the market\u2019s behavior or broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established concerning our securities.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may fail to meet publicly announced financial guidance or other expectations about our business, which would cause our Common Stock to decline in value.\nWe provide preliminary financial results or forward-looking financial guidance to our investors from time to time. Such statements are based on our current views, expectations, and assumptions, and they involve unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance, achievements, or share prices to be materially different from future performance, achievements, or share prices expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, changes to the assumptions used to forecast or calculate such guidance or expectations or the occurrence of risks related to our performance and our business, including those discussed in these risk factors, among others. Failure to meet any financial guidance or expectations regarding our future performance could harm our reputation and cause our stock price to decline.\nThe requirements of being a U.S. public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a U.S. public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand for our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual and current reports concerning our business and operating results.\nAs a result of the disclosure of information filing, our business and financial condition is more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to fix them, could divert resources of our management and harm our business and operating results.\nSEC regulations limit the amount of funds we can raise during any 12-month period pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3.\nAs of March 22, 2022, our public float was approximately $55.0 million, based on 45,825,089 shares of outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates and at a price of $1.20 per share, which was the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 22, 2022. SEC regulations limit the amount that companies with a public float of less than $75 million may raise during any 12-month period pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3. We are currently subject to General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3, or the Baby Shelf Rule. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are subject to the Baby Shelf Rule. Under the Baby Shelf Rule the amount of funds we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any 12-month period using a registration statement on Form S-3 is limited to one-third of the aggregate market value of the shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates of the Company. Therefore, we will be limited in the amount of proceeds we are able to raise by selling shares of our common stock using our Form S-3 until such time as our public float exceeds $75 million. Prior to such time as our public float exceeds $75 million, if our public float decreases, the amount of securities we may sell under our Form S-3 shelf registration statement will also decrease. Even if sufficient funding is available, there can be no assurance that it will be available on terms acceptable to us or our stockholders. Furthermore, if we are required or choose to file a new registration statement on a form other than Form S-3, we may incur additional costs and be subject to delays due to review by the SEC staff.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Common Stock adversely, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares of Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our Common Stock adversely or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our share price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our Common Stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of operations.\nWe are required to test our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment if events occur, or circumstances change that would indicate the remaining net book value of the finite-lived intangible assets might not be recoverable. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant, sustained decline in an entity\u2019s market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a considerable portion of our business, potential government actions and other factors. If our finite-lived intangible assets\u2019 fair value is less than their book value in the future, we could be required to record impairment charges. The amount of any future impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken.\nIf our estimates relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions or judgments that change or prove incorrect, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions include reserves and write-downs related to receivables and inventories, the recoverability of long-lived assets, the valuation allowance relating to the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets, valuation of equity and derivative instruments, and debt discounts, and the valuation of the assets and liabilities acquired by us.\nFuture sales and issuances of our Common Stock or rights to purchase our Common Stock, stock incentive plans and upon the exercise of outstanding securities exercisable for shares of our Common Stock, could result in substantial additional dilution of our stockholders, cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nWe will require additional capital to continue to execute our business plan and advance our research and development efforts. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing additional equity securities and exercising outstanding warrants, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell shares of preferred stock or Common Stock in one or more transactions at prices that may be at a discount to the then-current market value of our Common Stock and on such other terms and conditions as we may determine from time to time. Any such transaction could result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders. If we sell shares of our Common Stock in more than one transaction, stockholders who purchase our Common Stock may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales could also cause a drop in the market price of our Common Stock. The issuance of shares of our Common Stock in connection with public or private financing, in connection with our compensation programs, and upon exercise of outstanding warrants will have a dilutive impact on our other stockholders, and the issuance, or even potential issuance, of such shares, could hurt the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe exercise of stock options, warrants, and other securities could cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution. In addition to warrants issued in 2018, 2019, and 2020, in February 2021, we issued warrants to purchase up to 9,090,910 shares of our common stock. Moreover, holders of our stock options and warrants are likely to exercise them, if ever, at a time when we otherwise could obtain a price for the sale of our securities that is higher than the exercise price per security of the options or warrants. Such exercises, or the possibility of such exercises, may impede our efforts to obtain additional financing by selling additional securities or making such financing more costly. It may also reduce the price of our Common Stock.\nRisks Relating to Acquisitions\nOur acquisition strategy involves several risks.\nAs we engage in the acquisition discussion with other companies anticipating potential acquisition opportunities, including those that would be material or could involve businesses with operating characteristics that differ from our existing business operations, it may become available shortly. We intend to pursue them actively if and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available. Acquisitions involve several unique risks, including:\n\u25cf failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results, as well as the potential impairment of the acquired assets if operating results decline after acquisition;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25cf additional financing, if necessary and available, which could increase leverage and costs, dilute equity, or both;\n\u25cf the potential adverse effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles;\n\u25cf difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u25cf initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors, and other business partners of the companies we acquire after the acquisition;\n\u25cf the high cost and expenses of identifying, negotiating, and completing acquisitions;\n\u25cf the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources; and\n\u25cf risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations, which, in turn, could negatively impact our earnings and growth.\nWe have faced intense competition for acquisition candidates and expect to continue to face, limiting our ability to make acquisitions and leading to higher acquisition prices. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, acquire or manage other businesses profitably or successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our existing business without substantial costs, delays, or other operational or financial difficulties. In future acquisitions, we could incur additional indebtedness or pay consideration in excess of fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAny impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets are subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill, intangible assets, and/or long-lived assets may be impaired. Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairment test is written off in the determination period. Intangible assets (other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets) and other long-lived assets are generally amortized or depreciated over the useful life of such assets. From time to time we may acquire or invest in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with the businesses we acquire, which may adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill, intangible assets, or other long-lived assets due to an impairment test or any accelerated amortization or depreciation of other intangible assets or other long-lived assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 14060, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "VISL"}
