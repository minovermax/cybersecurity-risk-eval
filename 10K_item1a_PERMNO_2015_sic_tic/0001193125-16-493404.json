{"cik": "1260968", "company": "MARLIN BUSINESS SERVICES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other periodic statements we make.\nIf we cannot obtain deposits or financing, we may be unable to fund our operations. Our business requires a substantial amount of cash to operate. Our cash requirements will increase if our lease and loan originations increase. We obtain a substantial amount of the cash required for operations through a variety of external funding sources, such as deposits raised by MBB and, to a lesser extent, borrowings under a long-term loan facility. A failure to access the deposits market, to renew and increase the funding available under our existing facility or to add new funding facilities could affect our ability to fund and originate new leases and loans.\nOur ability to obtain continued access to the deposits market or to obtain a renewal of our lender\u2019s commitment and new funding facilities is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nconditions in the market for FDIC-insured deposits;\n\u2022\nrestrictions and costs associated with banking industry regulation which could negatively impact MBB;\n\u2022\nconditions in the long-term lending markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance of our leases and loans with the eligibility requirements established in connection with our long-term loan facility, including the level of lease and loan delinquencies and default; and\n\u2022\nour ability to service the leases and loans.\nWe are and will continue to be dependent upon these funding sources to continue to originate leases and loans and to satisfy our other working capital needs. We may be unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time, including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under existing financing arrangements. If any or all of our funding sources become unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, we may not have access to the financing necessary to conduct our business, which would limit our ability to fund our operations. Our long-term loan facility matures on May 4, 2016. As a result, we may be unable to continue to access this facility after those dates. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7). In the event we seek to obtain equity financing, our shareholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities. This dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities.\nA merger or consolidation with another company in which we are not the surviving entity, likewise, is an event of default under our financing facility. The Company\u2019s long-term loan facility contains acceleration clauses allowing the creditor to accelerate the scheduled maturities of the obligation under certain conditions that may not be objectively determinable (for example, \u201cif a material adverse change occurs\u201d). An event of default under the long-term loan facility could result in termination of further funds being made available. An event of default under our facility could result in an acceleration of amounts outstanding under the facility, foreclosure on all or a portion of the leases and loans financed by the facility and/or our removal as a servicer of the leases and loans financed by the facility. This would reduce our revenues from servicing and, by delaying any cash payment allowed to us under the financing facility until the lender has been paid in full, reduce our liquidity and cash flow.\nIf we inaccurately assess the creditworthiness of our end user customers, we may experience a higher number of lease and loan defaults, which may restrict our access to funding and reduce our earnings. We specialize in leasing equipment to small and mid-sized businesses. Small and mid-sized businesses may be more vulnerable than large businesses to economic downturns, as they typically depend on the management talents and efforts of one person or a small group of persons and often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete. Small and mid-sized business leases and loans, therefore, may entail a greater risk of delinquencies and defaults than leases and loans entered into with larger leasing customers. In addition, there is typically only limited publicly available financial and other information about small and mid-sized businesses and they often do not have audited financial statements. Accordingly, in making credit decisions, our underwriting guidelines rely upon the accuracy of information about these small and mid-sized businesses obtained from the small and mid-sized business owner and/or third-party sources, such as credit reporting agencies. If the information we obtain from small and mid-sized business owners and/or third-party sources is incorrect, our ability to make appropriate credit decisions will be impaired. If we inaccurately assess the creditworthiness of our end user customers, we may experience a higher number of lease and loan defaults and related decreases in our earnings.\nAn increase in delinquencies or lease and loan defaults could restrict our access to funding and could adversely affect our earnings. Defaulted leases and loans and certain delinquent leases and loans also do not qualify as collateral against which initial advances may be made under our funding facility. In addition, increasing rates of delinquencies or charge-offs could result in adverse changes in the structure and/or our cost of future financing. Any of these occurrences may cause us to experience reduced earnings.\nDeteriorated economic or business conditions may lead to greater than anticipated lease and loan defaults and credit losses, which could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and reduce our operating income. Historically, the capital and credit markets have experienced periodic volatility and disruption. In many cases, these markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices of, and credit availability to, certain companies without regard to those companies\u2019 underlying financial strength. Concerns over energy costs, geopolitical issues and the availability and cost of credit, have contributed to increased volatility for the economy and the capital and credit markets. In the event of extreme and prolonged market events, such as a global credit crisis, we could incur significant losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility.\nOur operating income may be reduced by various economic factors and business conditions, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. Delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because we extend credit primarily to small and mid-sized businesses, many of our customers may be particularly susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to make scheduled lease and loan payments during these periods. Therefore, to the extent that economic activity or business conditions deteriorate, our delinquencies and credit losses may increase. Unfavorable economic conditions may also make it more difficult for us to maintain both our new lease and loan origination volume and the credit quality of new leases and loans at levels previously attained. Unfavorable economic conditions could also increase our funding costs or operating cost structure or limit our access to funding. Any of these events could reduce our operating income.\nIf losses from leases and loans exceed our allowance for credit losses, our operating income will be reduced or eliminated. In connection with our financing of leases, we record an allowance for credit losses to provide for estimated losses. Our allowance for credit losses is based on both qualitative and quantitative factors including, among other things, past collection experience, lease and loan delinquency data, industry data, economic conditions and our assessment of collection risks. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate level of the allowance and, therefore, our determination of this allowance may prove to be inadequate to cover losses in connection with our portfolio of leases and loans. Factors that could lead to the inadequacy of our allowance may include our inability to manage collections effectively, unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific leasing customers, industries or geographic areas. Losses in excess of our allowance for credit losses would cause us to increase our provision for credit losses, reducing or eliminating our operating income.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, we must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. (See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Bank Capital and Regulatory Oversight). If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to maintain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d status under the regulatory framework, if we are deemed to be not well-managed under regulatory exam procedures or if we experience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company, our related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals and our ability to offer certain financial products may be compromised or impaired.\nWe may be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed. We are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. The Dodd-Frank Act sets a statutory floor for risk-based and leverage capital standards, and U.S. regulatory capital rules broadly establish minimum regulatory capital requirements. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Capital Adequacy\u201d above. We may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend, in part, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we may become subject to adverse regulatory actions or restrictions, and limitations on growth of our operations. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, our shareholders\u2019 interests in us could be diluted.\nOur financing sources impose covenants, restrictions and default provisions on us, which could lead to termination of our financing facility, acceleration of amounts outstanding under our financing facility and our removal as servicer. The legal agreement relating to our long-term loan facility contains numerous covenants, restrictions and default provisions relating to, among other things, maximum lease delinquency and default levels, a minimum net worth requirement, an interest coverage test and a maximum debt to equity ratio. A change in certain executive officers as described in the loan documents is an event of default under our long-term loan facility with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, unless we hire a replacement with skills and experience appropriate for performing the duties of the applicable positions within 120 days. On April 30, 2015, the Company announced the resignation of Lynne C. Wilson from her role as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective May 31, 2015. The change did not have a material adverse effect on our financing arrangement with Wells Fargo Capital Finance because we hired a replacement, effective August 4, 2015, with similar skills and experience. On October 20, 2015, the Company announced the retirement of Daniel P. Dyer from his role as Chief Executive Officer and director of Marlin Business Services Corp., effective October 20, 2015. This change did not have a material adverse effect on our financing arrangement with Wells Fargo Capital Finance because Mr. Dyer\u2019s duties have been assumed by someone with similar skills and experience.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nGovernment regulation significantly affects our business. The banking industry is heavily regulated, and such regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the federal deposit insurance funds, not shareholders. Since becoming a bank holding company on January 13, 2009, we have been subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and subject to the Bank Holding Company Act. Our bank subsidiary, MBB, is also subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. Such regulation affects lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth.\nThe financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 resulted in U.S. government and regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry, which have subjected financial institutions to additional restrictions, oversight and costs. In addition, new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates and financial product offerings and disclosures, among other things. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Such proposed changes in laws, regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may limit the manner in which we may conduct our business. Such changes may adversely affect us, including our ability to originate loans and leases, and may also result in the imposition of additional costs on us.\nFurther legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Recent conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. For example, on July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that, among other things, establish a systemic risk regulator, consolidate certain federal bank regulators and give shareholders an advisory vote on executive compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act substantially increases regulation of the financial services industry, imposes restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and has an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act adds sweeping deposit insurance provisions. Deposit insurance assessments are now based upon a bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base. The changes also make the $250,000 deposit insurance limit permanent, and expand the FDIC\u2019s authority to raise insurance premiums by setting a target ratio as high as the FDIC determines to be appropriate. The Dodd-Frank Act also restricts proprietary trading and the derivatives activities of banks and their affiliates.\nMany provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require the adoption of rules to implement it. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. The effect\nof the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations on our business and operations could be significant. In addition, we may be required to invest significant management time and resources to address the various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the numerous regulations that have been and are still required to be issued under it. The Dodd-Frank Act, any related legislation and any implementing regulations could have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther increase in the FDIC deposit insurance premium or required reserves may have a significant financial impact on us. The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions up to certain limits. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the DIF. In the event of a bank failure, the FDIC takes control of a failed bank and ensures payment of deposits up to insured limits using the resources of the DIF. The FDIC is required by law to maintain adequate funding of the DIF, and the FDIC may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the DIF\u2019s reserves against future losses, which will necessitate increased deposit insurance premiums that are to be borne primarily by institutions with assets of greater than $10 billion. While the changes made to base insurance premiums to date have not negatively impacted MBB, future increases in assessments may decrease our earnings and could have a material effect on the value of, or market for, our common stock.\nOn October 19, 2010, the FDIC further addressed plans to bolster the DIF by increasing the required reserve ratio for the industry to 1.35% (ratio of reserves to insured deposits) by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Current assessment rates will remain in effect until such time as the industry\u2019s reserve ratio reaches 1.15%.\nIf we are unable to effectively execute our business strategy, we may suffer material operating losses. Our financial position, liquidity and results of operations depend on management\u2019s ability to execute our business strategy and navigate through the ongoing challenging economic environment. Key factors involved in the execution of this strategy include achieving the desired volume of leases and loans of suitable yield and credit quality, effectively managing those leases and loans and obtaining appropriate funding. Accomplishing such a result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of our marketing capabilities, our management of the leasing process, our credit underwriting guidelines, our ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient servicing to our origination sources and our end user customers, our ability to execute effective credit risk management and collection techniques, our access to financing sources on acceptable terms and our ability to attract and retain high quality employees in all areas of our business. Failure to manage effectively these and other factors related to our business strategy and our overall operations may cause us to suffer material operating losses.\nIf we cannot effectively compete within the equipment leasing industry, we may be unable to increase our revenues or maintain our current levels of operations. The business of small-ticket equipment leasing is highly fragmented and competitive. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. A lower cost of funds could enable a competitor to offer leases and loans with yields that are lower than those we use to price our leases and loans, potentially forcing us to decrease our yields or lose origination volume. In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to establish more origination source and end user customer relationships and increase their market share. The barriers to entry are relatively low with respect to our business and, therefore, new competitors could enter the business of small-ticket equipment leasing at any time. The companies that typically provide financing for large-ticket or middle-market transactions could begin competing with us on small-ticket equipment leases. If this occurs, or we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, we may be unable to sustain our operations at their current levels or generate revenue growth.\nIf we cannot maintain our relationships with origination sources, our ability to generate lease and loan transactions and related revenues may be significantly impeded. We have formed relationships with thousands of\norigination sources, comprised primarily of independent equipment dealers. We rely on these relationships to generate lease and loan applications and originations. Most of these relationships are not formalized in written agreements and those that are formalized by written agreements are typically terminable at will. Our typical relationship does not commit the origination source to provide a minimum number of lease and loan transactions to us nor does it require the origination source to direct all of its lease and loan transactions to us. The decision by a significant number of our origination sources to refer their leasing transactions to another company could impede our ability to generate lease and loan transactions and related revenues.\nIf interest rates change significantly, we may be subject to higher interest costs with respect to our funding sources, which may cause us to suffer material losses. Because we use bank deposits and a long-term loan facility to fund our leases, our margins could be reduced by an increase in interest rates. Each of our leases is structured so that the sum of all scheduled lease payments will equal the cost of the equipment to us, less the residual, plus a return on the amount of our investment. This return is known as the yield. The yield on our leases is fixed because the scheduled payments are fixed at the time of lease origination. When we originate or acquire leases, we base our pricing in part on the spread we expect to achieve between the yield on each lease and the effective interest rate we expect to pay when we finance the lease. To the extent that a lease is financed with variable-rate funding, increases in interest rates during the term of a lease could narrow or eliminate the spread, or result in a negative spread. A negative spread is an interest cost greater than the yield on the lease. Our funding facility has a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). As a result, because our assets have a fixed interest rate, increases in LIBOR or our MMDA would negatively impact our earnings. If interest rates increase faster than we are able to adjust the pricing under our new leases and or loans, our net interest margin would be reduced. In addition, with respect to our fixed-rate deposits and borrowings, increases in interest rates could have the effect of increasing our costs on future transactions.\nThe departure of any of our key management personnel or our inability to hire suitable replacements for our management may result in defaults under our financing facility, which could restrict our ability to access funding and operate our business effectively. Our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management team. A change in certain executive officers as described in the loan documents is an event of default under our long-term loan facility with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, unless we hire a replacement with skills and experience appropriate for performing the duties of the applicable positions within 120 days. On April 30, 2015, the Company announced the resignation of Lynne C. Wilson from her role as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective May 31, 2015. The change did not have a material adverse effect on our financing arrangement with Wells Fargo Capital Finance because we hired a replacement, effective August 4, 2015, with similar skills and experience. On October 20, 2015, the Company announced the retirement of Daniel P. Dyer from his role as Chief Executive Officer and director of Marlin Business Services Corp., effective October 20, 2015. This change did not have a material adverse effect on our financing arrangement with Wells Fargo Capital Finance because Mr. Dyer\u2019s duties have been assumed by someone with similar skills and experience.\nThe termination or interruption of, or a decrease in volume under, our property insurance program would cause us to experience lower revenues and may result in a significant reduction in our net income. Our end user customers are required to obtain all-risk property insurance for the replacement value of the leased equipment. Each end user customer has the option of either delivering a certificate of insurance listing us as loss payee under a commercial property policy issued by a third-party insurer or satisfying such insurance obligation through our insurance program. Under our program, the end user customer purchases coverage under a master property insurance policy written by a national third-party insurer (our \u201cprimary insurer\u201d) with whom our captive insurance subsidiary, AssuranceOne, has entered into a 100% reinsurance arrangement. Termination or interruption of our program could occur for a variety of reasons, including: (1) adverse changes in laws or regulations affecting our primary insurer or AssuranceOne; (2) a change in the financial condition or financial strength ratings of our primary insurer or AssuranceOne; (3) negative developments in the loss reserves or future loss experience of AssuranceOne, which render it uneconomical for us to continue the program; (4) termination or expiration of the reinsurance agreement with our primary insurer, coupled with an inability by us to identify\nquickly and negotiate an acceptable arrangement with a replacement carrier; or (5) competitive factors in the property insurance market. If there is a termination or interruption of this program or if fewer end user customers elected to satisfy their insurance obligations through our program, we would experience lower revenues and our net income may be reduced.\nRegulatory and legal uncertainties could result in significant financial losses and may require us to alter our business strategy and operations. Laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to our equipment leases, the equipment leasing, telemarketing and collection processes or the banking industry. Any new legislation or regulation, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, that affect the equipment leasing industry or the banking industry could increase our costs of compliance or require us to alter our business strategy.\nWe, like other finance companies, face the risk of litigation, including class action litigation, and regulatory investigations and actions in connection with our business activities. These matters may be difficult to assess or quantify, and their magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. A substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could cause us to suffer significant costs and expenses and could require us to alter our business strategy and the manner in which we operate our business.\nFailure to realize the projected value of residual interests in equipment we finance would reduce the residual value of equipment recorded as assets on our balance sheet and may reduce our operating income. We estimate the residual value of the equipment which is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet. Realization of residual values depends on numerous factors including: the general market conditions at the time of expiration of the lease; the customer\u2019s election to enter into a renewal period; the cost of comparable new equipment; the obsolescence of the leased equipment; any unusual or excessive wear and tear on or damage to the equipment; the effect of any additional or amended government regulations; and the foreclosure by a secured party of our interest in a defaulted lease. Our failure to realize our recorded residual values would reduce the residual value of equipment recorded as assets on our balance sheet and may reduce our operating income.\nIf we experience significant telecommunications or technology downtime, our operations would be disrupted and our ability to generate operating income could be negatively impacted. Our business depends in large part on our telecommunications and information management systems. The temporary or permanent loss of our computer systems, telecommunications equipment or software systems, through casualty or operating malfunction, could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our ability to service our customers and lead to significant declines in our operating income.\nFailure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and other information, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information, or a violation of the Company\u2019s privacy and security policies with respect to such information, could adversely affect us. In the normal course of our business, we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers, stockholders and employees. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cyber-criminals around the world. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, stockholder, employee or our data by cybercrime or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action against us. Increasingly, our products and services are accessed through the Internet, and security breaches in connection with the delivery of our services via the Internet may affect us and could be detrimental to our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. Our operating results may differ from quarter to quarter, and these differences may be significant. Factors that may cause these differences include: changes in the volume of lease and loan applications, approvals and originations; changes in interest rates; the availability and cost of capital and funding; the degree of competition we face; the levels of charge-offs we incur; changes in the regulatory environment; general economic conditions; and other factors.\nOur common stock price is volatile. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause investors to lose part or all of their investment in our shares of common stock. Those factors that could cause fluctuations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of financial services companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of market analysts;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the equipment leasing industry in general and the Company in particular;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock performance of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nlegislative and regulatory changes with respect to the financial or banking industries;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nloss of external funding sources;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock or sales by insiders; or\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel.\nIt is possible that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of financial market analysts and investors and, as a result of these and other factors, the price of our common stock may decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock by a certain large shareholder could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. A substantial number of shares of our common stock could be sold into the public market pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-128329) that became effective on December 19, 2005. As of December 29, 2015, this large shareholder owned 2,976,925 shares of our common stock. The sale of all or a portion of these shares into the public market, or the perception that such a sale could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions and our right to issue preferred stock could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult. We are a Pennsylvania corporation. Anti-takeover provisions of Pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain certain other provisions that would make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, including a provision that our Board of Directors may issue preferred stock without shareholder approval.", "PERMNO": 89913, "SIC": 6172, "TIC": "MRLN"}
