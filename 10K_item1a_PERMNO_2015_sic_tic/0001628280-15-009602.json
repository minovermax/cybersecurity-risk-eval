RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nChanges to our businesses, operating structure, capital structure, or personnel relating to the implementation of our 2020 Vision strategic transformation initiative may not have the desired effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOn September 2, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a comprehensive strategy intended to have a positive transformative effect on ABM (the \u201c2020 Vision\u201d). This strategy identified a number of key priorities designed to differentiate ABM, accelerate revenue growth, and improve our margin profile. The 2020 Vision is expected to provide benefits that will depend, in part, on our successful execution of the strategy and the realization of anticipated growth opportunities and margin improvements. In addition, these benefits will also be impacted by expected efficiencies from the realignment of our business operations into five industry verticals (i.e., Aviation, Business and Industry, Education, Healthcare, and High Tech) to better support specific industries and deliver improved client solutions. In order to successfully execute our 2020 Vision, we must be able to attract and retain qualified personnel and provide development opportunities for our employees. Our success in realizing these growth opportunities, margin improvements, efficiencies, and talent pool enhancements (and the corresponding timing of this realization) are dependent on the successful execution of this strategy. We may not be able to execute on this strategy as a result of, among other things, client resistance to an integrated approach, the challenges of our vertical marketing strategy, difficulty in penetrating certain markets, inability to deliver end-to-end services requested, inability to acquire vertical market expertise, competition from integrated facility solutions providers, as well as increased competition from single service providers or module providers.\nEven if we are able to execute our 2020 Vision, we may not realize the full benefits that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame or at all. For example, although we may be able to leverage scale to manage costs more efficiently and effectively, the realignment of our business operations may not provide us with the anticipated competitive advantage or revenue growth. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the execution of our 2020 Vision in excess of what is currently forecast. While we anticipate that certain expenses will be incurred, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from our 2020 Vision may be offset by costs or delays incurred in its execution. In addition, our 2020 Vision may cause substantial disruption to our operations and may not have the anticipated positive effects on our relationships with our employees, clients, and suppliers.\nWe have high deductibles for certain insurable risks, and therefore we are subject to volatility associated with those risks, including the possibility that our risk management and safety programs may not have the intended effect of allowing us to reduce our insurance costs for casualty programs and that our insurance reserves may need to be materially adjusted from time to time.\nWe use a combination of insured and self-insurance programs to cover workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, automobile liability, property damage, and other insurable risks. We are responsible for claims both within and in excess of our retained limits under our insurance policies, and while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature, or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages. Our business may be negatively affected if our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable. We attempt to mitigate these risks through the implementation of company-wide safety and loss control efforts designed to decrease the incidence of events that might increase our liability. However, these risk mitigation efforts have not yet produced the desired effects and there can be no assurance that they will in the future.\nAlthough we engage third-party experts to assist us in estimating appropriate insurance accounting reserves, the determination of the required reserves is dependent upon significant actuarial judgments that have a material impact on our reserves. We use the results of the actuarial review to estimate our insurance rates and our insurance reserves for future periods as well as to adjust reserves, if appropriate, for prior years. Actual experience related to our insurance reserves can materially impact results, causing significant volatility in our operating results. We have experienced material negative trends and may continue to experience these and other material negative trends in future periods.\nShould we be unable to renew our excess, umbrella, or other commercial insurance policies at competitive rates, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, as would the incurrence of catastrophic uninsured claims or the inability or refusal of our insurance carriers to pay otherwise insured claims. Further, to the extent that we self-insure our losses, deterioration in our loss control and/or continuing claim management efforts could increase\nthe overall cost of claims within our retained limits. A material change in our insurance costs due to changes in the frequency of claims, the severity of the claims, the costs of excess/umbrella premiums, or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur captive insurance company may not bring us the benefits we expect.\nIn 2015, we formed a wholly-owned captive insurance company (\u201cIFM Assurance Company\u201d). Among other things, IFM Assurance Company is expected to better position our risk and safety programs and provide us with increased flexibility in the end-to-end management of our insurance programs as well as contribute to efficiencies relating to our insurance programs over time. There can be no assurance that IFM Assurance Company will bring about the intended benefits relating to our risk and safety programs or that it will provide us with increased flexibility in the management of our insurance programs, because we may experience unanticipated events that will reduce or eliminate anticipated benefits. In addition, expected cash tax savings related to coverage provided by IFM Assurance Company may not materialize, or any cash tax savings may not be as much as anticipated.\nRisks relating to our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn the past, a significant portion of our growth has been generated by acquisitions, and we expect to continue to acquire businesses in the future as part of our growth strategy. A slowdown in the pace or size of our acquisitions could lead to a slower growth rate. There can be no assurance that any acquisition we make in the future will provide us with the benefits that we anticipate when entering into the transaction. The process of integrating an acquired business may create unforeseen difficulties and expenses. The areas in which we may face risks in connection with any potential acquisition of a business include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nmanagement time and focus may be diverted from operating our business to acquisition integration;\n\u2022\nclients or key employees of an acquired business may not remain, which could negatively impact our ability to grow that acquired business;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired business\u2019s accounting, information technology, human resources, and other administrative systems may fail to permit effective management and expense reduction;\n\u2022\nimplementing internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired business that lacked some of these controls, procedures, and policies may fail;\n\u2022\nadditional indebtedness incurred as a result of an acquisition may impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated or unknown liabilities may arise relating to the acquired business.\nWe are subject to intense competition that can constrain our ability to gain business as well as our profitability.\nWe believe that each aspect of our business is highly competitive and that such competition is based primarily on price, quality of service, and ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes. A majority of our revenues are derived from projects requiring competitive bids; however, an invitation to bid is often conditioned upon prior experience, industry expertise, and financial strength. The low cost of entry in the facility solutions business results in a very competitive market. We experience competition from a large number of mostly regional and local owner-operated companies that may have better visibility to local markets and significantly lower labor and overhead costs, providing them with a competitive advantage. We also compete indirectly with companies that can internally perform one or more of the services we provide. These strong competitive pressures could inhibit our success in bidding for profitable business and our ability to increase prices as costs rise, thereby reducing margins.\nIncreases in costs that we cannot pass on to clients could affect our profitability.\nWe negotiate many contracts under which our clients agree to pay certain costs at specified rates, including those related to: workers\u2019 compensation; other insurance where we self-insure much of our risk; salary and salary-related expenses; and petroleum. If actual costs exceed the rates specified in the contracts, our profitability may decline unless we can negotiate increases in these rates. In addition, if our costs exceed those of our competitors, we may lose existing business unless we reduce our rates to levels that may impact future profitability.\nOur business success depends on our ability to preserve our long-term relationships with clients.\nWe primarily provide our services pursuant to agreements that are cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Our business associated with long-term relationships is generally more profitable than that associated with short-term relationships, because we generally incur higher initial costs on new contracts. Once these costs are expensed or fully amortized over the appropriate periods, the underlying contracts become more profitable. Our loss of long-term clients could have an adverse impact on our profitability even if we generate equivalent revenues from new clients. In addition, our clients can unilaterally decrease the amount of services we provide or terminate all services pursuant to the terms of our service agreements. Any loss of a significant number of clients could in the aggregate materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business success depends on retaining senior management and attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur future performance depends on the continuing services and contributions of our senior management to execute on our acquisition and organic growth strategy and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Our future success also depends, in large degree, on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Any unplanned turnover in senior management or inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nWe are at risk of losses stemming from accidents or other incidents at facilities in which we operate, which could cause significant damage to our reputation and financial loss.\nWe depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for quality integrated facility solutions. Our clients\u2019 expectations and perception of the quality of our services are in large part determined by the satisfaction they derive from contact with our managers. Any damage to our reputation may adversely affect our results of operations. The areas in which we may face risks in connection with damage to our reputation and other financial loss include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nAdverse publicity stemming from an accident or other incident involving our facility operations could result in a negative perception of our services and the loss of existing or potential clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe provide services in support of commercial aviation at airports in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our operations involve passenger assistance, such as wheelchair operations, aircraft cabin cleaning, janitorial services, shuttle bus operations, and access control. An accident or other incident involving our aviation support services could expose us to significant liability.\n\u2022\nWe provide food and nutrition services for our healthcare clients. As such, we are subject to risks affecting the food industry, including food spoilage and food contamination. An incident involving our food and nutrition services could harm our reputation and expose us to significant liability if the consumption of our food products causes injury, illness, or death.\nNegative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, changes in tax law where we have significant operations could have an adverse effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. We are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the United States and United Kingdom. Negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in energy prices and government regulations could adversely impact the results of operations of our Building & Energy Solutions business.\nEnergy efficiency projects are designed to reduce a client\u2019s overall consumption of commodities such as electricity and natural gas. The economic benefit to the client is impacted by volatility in the price of those commodities. Downward fluctuations in commodity prices may reduce clients\u2019 demand for our services. This could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe depend, in part, on federal and state legislation and policies that support energy efficiency projects. If current legislation or policies are adversely amended, eliminated, or not extended beyond their current expiration dates, or if funding for energy incentives is reduced or delayed, it could adversely affect our ability to obtain new business and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn some instances, we offer certain clients guaranteed energy savings on installed equipment. In the event those guaranteed savings are not achieved, we may be required to pay liquidated or other damages.\nSignificant delays or reductions in appropriations for our government contracts may negatively affect our business and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe funding of U.S. Government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In many situations, Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the contract performance period may extend over several fiscal years. Accordingly, programs are often partially funded and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds committed on a contract, we may not receive reimbursement of those costs unless additional funds are appropriated. In the event that government funding for any of the programs relating to our U.S. Government contracts is reduced or delayed, the U.S. Government could terminate or adjust our contracts or subcontracts under such program, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe conduct some of our operations through joint ventures, and our ability to do business may be affected by the failure of our joint venture partners to perform their obligations.\nThe success of our joint ventures depends, in large degree, on the satisfactory performance by our joint venture partners of their obligations, including any obligation to commit capital, equity, or credit support as required by the joint venture agreements. If a joint venture partner fails to perform its obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties or any other reason, the joint venture may be unable to perform or deliver its contracted services. In addition, we also participate in joint ventures where we are not a controlling party, and in these cases, we may have limited control over the joint venture.\nAny improper actions by our joint venture employees, partners, or agents, including, but not limited to, failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practice Act or the U.K. Bribery Act, could result in civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties, or suspension or debarment from government contracts, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as well as our reputation and ability to conduct business.\nOur business may be negatively affected by adverse weather conditions.\nWeather conditions, including fluctuations in temperatures, snow storms, heavy flooding, hurricanes, and natural disasters, can negatively impact portions of our business. Within our Building & Energy Solutions segment, adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter season, could impact certain of our services which require us to perform work outdoors. Within the Parking and Other segments, snow can lead to reduced travel activity, as well as increases in certain costs, both of which negatively affect gross profit. On the other hand, the absence of snow during the winter could cause us to experience reduced revenues in our Janitorial segment. Cooler than normal temperatures during the summer months could reduce the need for our Building & Energy Solutions services, particularly\nin our businesses that provide or service air conditioning units, and result in reduced revenues and profitability during the period such unseasonal weather conditions persist.\nFederal health care reform legislation may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law in the United States (collectively, the \u201cHealth Care Reform Laws\u201d). The Health Care Reform Laws require large employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing such coverage. In addition, the Health Care Reform Laws establish new regulations on health plans. Accordingly, we could incur costs associated with: i) providing additional health insurance benefits; ii) the payment of penalties if the minimum level of coverage is not provided; and iii) the filing of additional information with the Internal Revenue Service to comply with these laws. If we are unable to raise the rates we charge our clients to cover these expenses, our operating profit could be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to business continuity risks associated with centralization of certain administrative functions.\nCertain administrative functions, primarily in North America, have been regionally centralized to improve efficiency and reduce costs. To the extent these central locations are disrupted or disabled for a long period of time due to crisis, natural disaster, or other business interruption, key business processes, such as accounts payable, information technology, payroll, and general management operations, could be interrupted.\nOur services in areas of military conflict expose us to additional risks.\nAlthough substantially all of our operations are conducted in the United States, the services we provide internationally, including through the use of subcontractors, are sometimes in areas of military conflict or at military installations, which increases the risk of a situation causing injury or loss of life to our employees, subcontractors, or other third parties. In addition to the human costs, this could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and our ability to conduct business.\nWe are subject to cyber-security risks arising out of breaches of security relating to sensitive company, client, and employee information and to the technology that manages our operations and other business processes.\nOur business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage, and reporting. Despite careful security and controls design, our information technology systems and those of our third-party providers could become subject to cyber attacks. Network, system, application, and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation. Theft of intellectual property or trade secrets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents. Any such operational disruption and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, negative publicity, or business delays and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Market and Economic Conditions\nA decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur revenues are affected by commercial real estate occupancy levels. In certain geographic areas and service lines, our most profitable revenues come from what is known as tag work. These services are performed for tenants in buildings in which we perform building services for the property owner or management company. A decline in occupancy rates could result in a decline in scope of work, including tag work, and depressed prices for our services. If this were to occur, we could experience lower revenues and pricing pressures resulting in lower margins. Additionally, further consolidation of property management companies, as well as adverse changes in occupancy rates may further reduce demand, depress prices for our services, and cause our clients to cancel their service agreements with us. This could reduce earnings and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDeterioration in general economic conditions could reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition.\nSlow domestic and international economic growth or other negative changes in global, national, and local economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business. Specifically, adverse economic conditions may result in clients cutting back on discretionary spending, such as tag work. Additionally, since a significant portion of our aviation services and parking revenues are tied to the numbers of airline passengers, hotel guests, and sports arenas attendees, results for these businesses could be adversely affected by curtailment of business or personal travel and cutbacks in discretionary spending.\nFinancial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our clients could adversely affect our results.\nFuture revenues and our ability to collect accounts receivable depend, in part, on the financial strength of our clients. We estimate an allowance for accounts receivable that we do not consider collectible. This allowance adversely impacts our profitability. In the event clients experience financial difficulty and, in particular, if bankruptcy results, our profitability could be further impacted by a failure to collect accounts receivable in excess of the estimated allowance. Declines in our ability to collect receivables or in the level of client spending could adversely affect our results of operations and our liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Indebtedness and Impairment Charges\nAny future increase in the level of our debt or in interest rates could affect our results of operations.\nAny future increase in the level of our debt will likely increase our interest expense. Unless the operating income associated with the use of these funds exceeds the debt expense, borrowing money could have an adverse impact on our results. In addition, incurring debt requires that a portion of cash flow from operating activities be dedicated to interest payments and principal payments, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations and capital expenditures or to capitalize on future business opportunities. Because current interest rates on our debt are variable, an increase in prevailing rates would increase our interest costs. Further, our syndicated credit agreement contains both financial covenants and other covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified transactions, which may also constrain our flexibility.\nOur ability to operate and pay our debt obligations depends upon our access to cash.\nBecause we conduct business operations through operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities to generate the funds necessary to meet financial obligations. Delays in collections, which could be heightened by disruptions in the credit markets and the financial services industry, or legal restrictions could restrict our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions or loans to us. The earnings from, or available assets of, these operating subsidiaries may not be sufficient to fund operations. If this were to occur, we could become unable to make distributions to pay interest on our debt obligations when due or to pay the principal of such debt. In addition, we have standby letters of credit and insurance deposits that represent amounts collateralizing self-insurance claims that we cannot access for operations.\nGoodwill impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We have elected to make the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, August 1st, the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of one of our businesses. If the fair value of one of our reporting units is less than its carrying value, we would record an impairment for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value. The valuation of our reporting units requires significant judgment in evaluation of recent indicators of market activity and estimated future cash flows, discount rates, and other factors. The amount of any impairment could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken.\nImpairment of long-lived assets may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. These events and circumstances include, but are not limited to, a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long-lived asset, or a change in its physical condition. When this occurs, a recoverability test is performed that compares the projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If as a result of this test we conclude that the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value. The amount of any impairment could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken.\nRisks Related to Labor and Legal Proceedings\nWe are defendants in class and representative actions and other lawsuits alleging various claims that could cause us to incur substantial liabilities.\nOur business involves employing tens of thousands of employees, many of whom work at our clients\u2019 facilities. We incur risks relating to our employment of these workers, including, but not limited to: claims of misconduct or negligence on the part of our employees; claims by our employees of discrimination or harassment directed at them, including claims relating to actions of our clients; claims related to the employment of undocumented workers or unlicensed personnel; and claims for violations of wage and hour requirements. Some or all of these claims may lead to litigation, including class action litigation, and these matters may cause us to incur negative publicity with respect to these problems. Our insurance will not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. In addition, it is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceeding to which we may be subject. These lawsuits and other proceedings may consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits and other proceedings. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, cause us to incur substantial liabilities that could have a material adverse effect upon our business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.\nChanges in immigration laws or enforcement actions or investigations under such laws could significantly adversely affect our labor force, operations, and financial results.\nAs many of our jobs do not require our employees to be able to read or write the English language, we are an attractive employer for recent \u00e9migr\u00e9s to this country. While immigration laws require us to take certain steps intended to confirm the legal status of our immigrant labor force, and while we bolster these steps with additional measures designed to reinforce compliance, we may nonetheless inadvertently employ workers who are or become undocumented. Violations of laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties. To the extent that these laws and regulations and corresponding enforcement practices and compliance standards become more stringent, our expenses could be negatively impacted.\nLabor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations.\nAt October 31, 2015, approximately 55% of our employees were subject to various local collective bargaining agreements, some of which will expire or become subject to renegotiation during 2016. In addition, at any given time we may face a number of union organizing drives. When one or more of our major collective bargaining agreements becomes subject to renegotiation or when we face union organizing drives, we and the union may disagree on important issues that could lead to a strike, work slowdown, or other job actions at one or more of our locations. In a market where we and a number of major competitors are unionized, but other competitors are not unionized, we could lose clients to competitors who are not unionized. A strike, work slowdown, or other job action could in some cases disrupt us from providing services, resulting in reduced revenues. If declines in client service occur or if our clients are targeted for sympathy strikes by other unionized workers, contract cancellations could result. Moreover, negotiating a first time agreement or renegotiating an existing collective bargaining agreement could result in a substantial increase in labor and benefits expenses that we may be unable to pass through to clients.\nWe participate in multiemployer pension plans that under certain circumstances could result in material liabilities being incurred.\nWe participate in various multiemployer pension plans under union and industry-wide agreements, which generally provide defined pension benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Because of the nature of multiemployer plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. In the event another participating employer in a multiemployer plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, including us. In the event of the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or if we withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan, under applicable law we potentially could incur material liabilities. We further discuss our participation in multiemployer pension and postretirement plans in Note 14, \u201cEmployee Benefit Plans,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther\nActions of activist investors could be disruptive and costly and could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\nPublic companies have been the target of activist investors. In the event that a third party, such as an activist investor, proposes to change our governance policies or board of directors or makes other proposals concerning our operations, our review and consideration of such proposals may create a significant distraction for our management and employees. This could negatively impact our ability to execute our 2020 Vision and may require us to expend significant time and resources. Such proposals may also create uncertainties with respect to our financial position and operations and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nDisasters or acts of terrorism could disrupt services.\nStorms, earthquakes, drought, floods, other disasters, or acts of terrorism may result in reduced revenues or property damage. Disasters may also cause economic dislocations throughout the country. In addition, disasters or acts of terrorism may increase the volatility of financial results, due to increased costs caused by the disaster with partial or no corresponding compensation from clients.", "PERMNO": 47730, "SIC": 7340, "TIC": "ABM"}
