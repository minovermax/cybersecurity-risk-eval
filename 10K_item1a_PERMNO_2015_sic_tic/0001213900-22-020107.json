{"cik": "1117171", "company": "CBAK Energy Technology, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA\nThe audit report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was prepared by an auditor who is not inspected by the PCAOB and, as such, you are deprived of the benefits of such inspection, we may be subject to additional Nasdaq listing criteria or other penalties and our securities may be delisted from the U.S. stock market if we were unable to cure the situation to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time.\nAuditors of companies that are registered with the SEC and traded publicly in the United States, including the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company, must be registered with the PCAOB, and are required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess their compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards. However, the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China of the People\u2019s Republic of China and Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in such jurisdictions. Inspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside China have identified deficiencies in those firms\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct full inspections of auditors operating in China makes it more difficult to evaluate our auditors\u2019 audit procedures or quality control procedures.\nAs part of a continued regulatory focus in the United States on access to audit and other information currently protected by national law, in particular China\u2019s, the HFCA Act was signed into law on December 18, 2020. This act amends the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to direct the SEC to prohibit securities of any registrant from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges or traded \u201cover-the-counter\u201d if the auditor of the registrant\u2019s financial statements is not subject to PCAOB inspection for three consecutive years after the law becomes effective.\nOn March 24, 2021, the SEC announced that it had adopted interim final amendments to implement the certification and disclosure requirements of the HFCA Act and that it was seeking public comment on the issuer identification process as well as the submission and disclosure requirements. On May 13, 2021, the PCAOB issued proposed PCAOB Rule 6100 Board Determinations Under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act for public comment. The proposed rule provides a framework for making determinations as to whether PCAOB is unable to inspect an audit firm in a foreign jurisdiction, including the timing, factors, bases, publication and revocation or modification of such determinations, and such determinations will be made on a jurisdiction-wide basis in a consistent manner applicable to all firms headquartered in the jurisdiction.\nFurthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the \u201cAHFCA Act\u201d), which if enacted into law would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer\u2019s securities from trading on U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive \u201cnon-inspection\u201d years instead of three.\nOn September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the HFCA Act, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCA Act, whether the Board is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction.\nOn December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to finalize the interim final rules previously issued in March 2021, and established procedures to identify issuers and prohibit the trading of the securities of certain registrants as required by the HFCA Act. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by the authority in foreign jurisdictions. The final amendments require SEC identified issuers to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that, if true, it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in the public accounting firm\u2019s foreign jurisdiction. The amendments also require that an SEC-identified issuer that is a \u201cforeign issuer,\u201d as defined in Exchange Act Rule 3b-4, provide certain additional disclosures in its annual report for itself and any of its consolidated foreign operating entities. An SEC-identified issuer will be required to comply with the submission and disclosure requirements in the annual report for each year in which it was identified. If a registrant is identified as an SEC identified issuer based on its annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, the registrant will be required to comply with the submission or disclosure requirements in its annual report filing covering the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. As a result, we should comply with the submission and disclosure requirements in our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 and each additional year in which we are identified. In the event that we have had three consecutive \u201cnon-inspection\u201d years by the SEC, our securities will be prohibited from trading on any national securities exchange or over-the-counter markets in the United States. Moreover, if the AHFCA Act is enacted into law, it would reduce the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted from three years to two years.\nOn December 16, 2021, pursuant to the HFCA Act, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in such jurisdictions. The PCAOB\u2019s report identified specific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations. Our registered public accounting firm, Centurion ZD CPA & Co., is headquartered in Hong Kong and was identified in this report as a firm subject to the PCAOB\u2019s determination.\nAdditionally, in October 2021, Nasdaq adopted additional listing criteria applicable to companies that primarily operate in jurisdictions where local regulators impose secrecy laws, national security laws or other laws that restrict U.S. regulators from accessing information relating to the issuer, or a Restrictive Market. Under the new rule, whether a jurisdiction permits PCAOB inspection would be a factor in determining whether a jurisdiction is deemed by the Nasdaq to be a Restrictive Market. Mainland China and Hong Kong will likely be determined to be Restrictive Markets and, as a result, the Nasdaq may impose on us additional continued listing criteria or deny continued listing of our securities on the Nasdaq.\nWhile we understand that there has been dialogue among the CSRC, the SEC and the PCAOB regarding the inspection of PCAOB-registered accounting firms in China, there can be no assurance that our auditor or us will be able to comply with the requirements imposed by U.S. regulators or Nasdaq. We plan to identify and engage an independent public accounting firm that satisfies the PCAOB inspection requirements for the audit of our consolidated financial statements, subject to compliance with SEC and other requirements prior to the three-year (or two-year under the AHFCA Act) deadline of the HFCA Act. However, the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected as a result of anticipated negative impacts of the rules promulgated under the HFCA Act and other executive, regulatory or legislative actions upon, as well as negative investor sentiment towards, companies with significant operations in China that are listed in the United States, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations in China at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted outside China by and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and in the value of our securities. Any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted outside China by and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nSubstantially all of our operations are conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are affected to a significant extent by the economic, political and legal developments in the PRC. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the extent of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, and control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and to guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy but may also have a negative effect on us. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us.\nThe Chinese government recently has published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will not in the future release regulations or policies regarding our industry that could require us or our PRC subsidiaries to seek permission from Chinese authorities to continue to operate our business in China, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, recent statements made by the Chinese government have indicated an intent to increase the government\u2019s oversight and control over offerings of companies with significant operations in China that are to be conducted in foreign markets, as well as foreign investment in China-based issuers like us. Any such action, once taken by the Chinese government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer our securities, and could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless.\nFor example, in July 2021, the Chinese government provided new guidance on China-based companies raising capital outside of China, including through arrangements via variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). In light of such developments, the SEC has imposed enhanced disclosure requirements on China-based companies seeking to register securities with the SEC. Although we have never adopted a VIE structure and our business in China does not involve any type of restricted industry under Chinese regulations, any future Chinese, U.S. or other rules and regulations that place restrictions on capital raising or other activities by companies with extensive operations in China could adversely affect our business. If the business environment in China deteriorates from the perspective of domestic or international investment, or if relations between China and the United States or other governments deteriorate, the Chinese government may intervene with our operations, and our business in China, as well as the value of our securities, may also be adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. and Chinese regulations or in relations between the United States and China may adversely impact our business, our operating results, our ability to raise capital and the value of our securities. Any such changes may take place quickly and with very little notice.\nThe U.S. government, including the SEC, has made statements and taken certain actions that led to changes to United States and international relations, and will impact companies with connections to the United States or China. The SEC has issued statements primarily focused on companies with significant China-based operations, such as us. For example, on July 30, 2021, Gary Gensler, Chairman of the SEC, issued a Statement on Investor Protection Related to Recent Developments in China, pursuant to which Chairman Gensler stated that he has asked the SEC staff to engage in targeted additional reviews of filings for companies with significant China-based operations. The statement also addressed risks inherent in companies with VIE structures. We have never adopted a VIE structure and are not in any industry that is subject to foreign ownership limitations by China. However, it is possible that the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC may be subject to enhanced review by the SEC.\nIn response to the SEC\u2019s July 30, 2021 statement, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d) announced on August 1, 2021, that \u201cit is our belief that Chinese and U.S. regulators shall continue to enhance communication with the principle of mutual respect and cooperation, and properly address the issues related to the supervision of China-based companies listed in the U.S. so as to form stable policy expectations and create benign rules framework for the market.\u201d The CSRC pledged to continue to collaborate \u201cclosely with different stakeholders including investors, companies, and relevant authorities to further promote transparency and certainty of policies and implementing measures,\u201d and emphasized that it \u201chas always been open to companies\u2019 choices to list their securities on international or domestic markets in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.\u201d If any new legislation, executive orders, laws and/or regulations are implemented, if the U.S. or Chinese governments take retaliatory actions due to the recent U.S.-China tension or if the Chinese government exerts more oversight and control over securities offerings that are conducted in the United States, such changes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to raise capital and the value of our securities.\nThere are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws, rules and regulations.\nSubstantially all of our operations are conducted in the PRC, and are governed by PRC laws, rules and regulations. Our PRC subsidiaries are subject to laws, rules and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws, rules and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past four decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws, rules and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China or may be subject to significant degrees of interpretation by PRC regulatory agencies. In particular, because these laws, rules and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited number of published decisions and the nonbinding nature of such decisions, and because the laws, rules and regulations often give the relevant regulator significant discretion in how to enforce them, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations involve uncertainties and can be inconsistent and unpredictable. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until after the occurrence of the violation. Any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nThe PRC government has recently announced its plans to enhance its regulatory oversight of Chinese companies listing overseas. The Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities issued on July 6, 2021 called for:\n\u25cf tightening oversight of data security, cross-border data flow and administration of classified information, as well as amendments to relevant regulation to specify responsibilities of overseas listed Chinese companies with respect to data security and information security;\n\u25cf enhanced oversight of overseas listed companies as well as overseas equity fundraising and listing by Chinese companies; and\n\u25cf extraterritorial application of China\u2019s securities laws.\nOn December 24, 2021, the CSRC released the Administrative Provisions of the State Council Regarding Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (the \u201cAdministrative Provisions\u201d), and the Measures Regarding Recordation of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (the \u201cMeasures\u201d). The Administrative Provisions and Measures aim to establish a unified supervision system and promote cross-border regulatory cooperation. The Measures lay out filing procedures for domestic companies to record their initial public offerings and follow-on offerings abroad with the CSRC. Issuers are required to file follow-on offerings with the CSRC within 3 business days after the closing of such offerings.\nAccording to the Q&A held by CSRC officials for journalists thereafter, the CSRC will adhere to the principle of non-retroactive application of law and first focus on issuers conducting initial public offerings and follow-on offerings by requiring them to complete the recordation procedures. Other issuers will be given a sufficient transition period. The CSRC officials also noted that the regulation system contemplated by the draft Administrative Provisions and Measures differentiates between IPOs and follow-on offerings to take into account overseas capital markets\u2019 fast and efficient features and to reduce impacts on overseas financing activities by domestic companies. If the Administrative Provisions and the Measures are enacted as proposed, we expect to perform necessary recordation filings with the CSRC for our listing on the Nasdaq within the prescribed transition period and for future offerings that take place after the Administrative Provisions and the Measures enter into force.\nAs there are still uncertainties regarding the enactment, interpretation and implementation of regulations and rules under the umbrella of the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, there is no assurance that our business, operating results, cash flows and prospect will not be negatively affected by new regulatory requirements in the future in China.\nPRC laws and regulations establish complex procedures in connection with certain acquisitions of China-based companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions or mergers in China.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d), the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the CSRC, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, jointly adopted the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, which came into effect on September 8, 2006 and were amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rules include, among other things, provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of an overseas listing of securities of a PRC company obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle\u2019s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings through special purpose vehicles. However, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the scope and applicability of the M&A Rules to offshore special purpose vehicles.\nThe regulations also established additional procedures and requirements that are expected to make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors more time consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise, or that the approval from the MOFCOM be obtained in circumstances where overseas companies established or controlled by PRC enterprises or residents acquire affiliated domestic companies.\nMoreover, according to the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China promulgated on August 30, 2007 and the Provisions on Thresholds for Reporting of Concentrations of Undertakings (the \u201cPrior Reporting Rules\u201d) issued by the State Council in August 2008 and amended in September 2018, the concentration of business undertakings by way of mergers, acquisitions or contractual arrangements that allow one market player to take control of or to exert decisive impact on another market player must also be notified in advance to the anti-monopoly enforcement agency of the State Council when the applicable threshold is crossed and such concentration shall not be implemented without the clearance of prior reporting. In addition, the Regulations on Implementation of Security Review System for the Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprise by Foreign Investors (the \u201cSecurity Review Rules\u201d) issued by the MOFCOM that became effective in September 2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise \u201cnational defense and security\u201d concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise \u201cnational security\u201d concerns are subject to strict review by the MOFCOM, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review by structuring the transaction through, among other things, trusts, entrustment or contractual control arrangements.\nIn the event that our acquisition of other companies in China falls within the scope of these regulations, compliance with these regulations to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including approval from the MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.\nCBAK Energy Technology, Inc., as a holding company incorporated in Nevada, the United States, without material operations of its own, relies on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by its PRC operating subsidiaries for its cash needs.\nCBAK Energy Technology, Inc. is a holding company, and we conduct all of our operations through our PRC subsidiaries. CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. relies on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by its PRC subsidiaries for its cash needs, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to its stockholders, to service any debt it may incur and to pay its operating expenses. Current regulations in the PRC permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. According to the articles of association of our PRC subsidiaries, each of our PRC subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on the PRC accounting standards and regulations each year to its statutory general reserve, until the balance in the reserve reaches 50% of the registered capital of the company. Funds in the reserve are not distributable to CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. in forms of cash dividends, loans or advances. In addition, if our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to CBAK Energy Technology, Inc., which in turn will adversely affect its available cash.\nIn addition, our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends and other cash distributions is subject to foreign exchange restrictions in China. For example, to address persistent capital outflows and the RMB\u2019s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the People\u2019s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, implemented a series of capital control measures in the subsequent months, including stricter vetting procedures for China-based companies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions, dividend payments and shareholder loan repayments. The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 dividends and other distributions may be subject to tightened scrutiny in the future. The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any.\nAs a matter of fact, we have never declared or paid any dividends to CBAK Energy Technology, Inc.\u2019s stockholders, nor do we have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nThe value of our securities will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars, as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nInvestors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws against us or our management.\nAll of our current operations are conducted in China. Moreover, most of our current directors and officers are nationals or residents of China. All or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States and in the PRC. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside China upon these persons. In addition, uncertainty exists as to whether the courts of China would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or such officers and/or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in China against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.\nThe approval of the CSRC or other Chinese regulatory agencies may be required in connection with our future capital-raising activities outside China under Chinese law.\nThe \u201cM&A Rules\u201d purport to require offshore special purpose vehicles that are controlled by Chinese companies or individuals and that have been formed for the purpose of seeking a public listing on an overseas stock exchange through acquisitions of Chinese domestic companies or assets in exchange for the shares of the offshore special purpose vehicles shall obtain CSRC approval prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange.\nBased on our understanding of the Chinese laws and regulations currently in effect, CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. or any of our PRC subsidiaries will not be required to submit an application to the CSRC for its approval of any of our offerings of securities to investors outside China under the M&A Rules. However, there remains some uncertainties as to how the M&A Rules will be interpreted or implemented, and our view of our obligations under the M&A Rules is subject to any new laws, rules and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M&A Rules. We cannot assure you that relevant Chinese government agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion.\nFurthermore, on July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly promulgated the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, pursuant to which Chinese regulators are required to accelerate rulemaking related to the overseas issuance and listing of securities, and update the existing laws and regulations related to data security, cross-border data flow, and management of confidential information. Numerous regulations, guidelines and other measures have been or are expected to be adopted under the umbrella of or in addition to the Cybersecurity Law and Data Security Law. On December 24, 2021, the CSRC released the Administrative Provisions of the State Council Regarding Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) and the Measures Regarding Recordation of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments).\nAs there are still uncertainties regarding the interpretation and implementation of such regulatory guidance, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with China\u2019s new regulatory requirements relating to our future capital-raising activities outside China and we may become subject to more stringent requirements with respect to matters including cross-border investigation and enforcement of legal claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as of the date hereof, we are not aware of any Chinese laws or regulations in effect requiring that we or any of our PRC subsidiaries obtain permission from any Chinese authority to issue securities to investors outside China, and we or any of our PRC subsidiaries have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanction in relation to the trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq from the CSRC, the Cybersecurity Administration of China (\u201cCAC\u201d) or any other Chinese authorities.\nWe believe that we or any of our PRC subsidiaries are not required to submit an application to the CSRC or the CAC for the approval of any of our offerings of securities to investors outside China or trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq. However, there remains significant uncertainty as to the enactment, interpretation and implementation of regulatory requirements related to overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities under Chinese laws. If it is determined in the future that the approval of the CSRC, CAC or any other regulatory authority is required for any of our offerings, we may face sanctions by the CSRC, the CAC or other Chinese regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in China, limit our ability to pay dividends out of China, limit our operations in China, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from overseas offerings into China or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, the value of our securities, as well as our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors or cause such securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless.\nPRC regulation of loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may restrict or prevent CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. from making additional capital contributions or loans to its PRC subsidiaries.\nCBAK Energy Technology, Inc., as an offshore holding company, is permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to its PRC subsidiaries through loans or capital contributions. However, loans by CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. to its PRC subsidiaries to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the local counterpart of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and capital contributions to its PRC subsidiaries are subject to the requirement of making necessary filings in the Foreign Investment Comprehensive Management Information System, and registration with other governmental authorities in China.\nThe State Administration of Foreign Exchange promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or Circular 19, effective on June 1, 2015, in replacement of the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign- Invested Enterprises, the Notice from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Relevant Issues Concerning Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Exchange Businesses, and the Circular on Further Clarification and Regulation of the Issues Concerning the Administration of Certain Capital Account Foreign Exchange Businesses. According to Circular 19, the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company is regulated such that RMB capital may not be used for the issuance of RMB entrusted loans, the repayment of inter-enterprise loans or the repayment of bank loans that have been transferred to a third party. Although Circular 19 allows RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise to be used for equity investments within the PRC, it also reiterates the principle that RMB converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope. Thus, it is unclear whether the State Administration of Foreign Exchange will permit such capital to be used for equity investments in the PRC in actual practice. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Standardizing the Foreign Exchange Settlement Management Policy of Capital Account, or Circular 16, effective on June 9, 2016, which reiterates some of the rules set forth in Circular 19, but changes the prohibition against using RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company to issue RMB entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to grant loans to non-associated enterprises. Violations of Circular 19 and Circular 16 could result in administrative penalties. Circular 19 and Circular 16 may significantly limit our ability to transfer any foreign currency CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. holds to its PRC subsidiaries, which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business in the PRC.\nIn light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans or future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries. As a result, uncertainties exist as to our ability to provide prompt financial support to our PRC subsidiaries when needed. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use foreign currency and to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nFailure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the investment in offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident stockholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us.\nOn July 14, 2014, SAFE issued the Circular on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Residents\u2019 Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles (\u201cCircular 37\u201d), which replaced the Circular 75, promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d\nWe have notified substantial beneficial owners of our company who we know are PRC residents to comply with the registration obligation. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with Circular 37. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to Circular 37 or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in Circular 37 may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Failure to register or amend the registration may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries or receive dividends or other distributions from our PRC subsidiaries or other proceeds from disposal of our PRC subsidiaries, or we may be penalized by SAFE. These risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.\nOn March 16, 2007, the National People\u2019s Congress of China passed a new Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed its implementing rules, which took effect on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within China is considered a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as \u201csubstantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties\u201d of the enterprise.\nOn April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation non-Chinese enterprise or group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a \u201cnon-domestically incorporated resident enterprise\u201d if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often resident in China. A resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying dividends to its non-PRC shareholders. In addition, the SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues concerning the Determination of Resident Enterprises Based on the Standards of Actual Management Institutions in January 2014 to provide more guidance on the implementation of Circular 82. This bulletin further provides that, among other things, an entity that is classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d in accordance with the circular shall file the application for classifying its status of residential enterprise with the local tax authorities where its main domestic investors are registered. From the year in which the entity is determined to be a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d any dividend, profit and other equity investment gains from other resident enterprises within China in previous years (on or after January 1, 2008) shall be taxed in accordance with the enterprise income tax law and its implementing rules.\nWe may be deemed to be a resident enterprise by Chinese tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as interest on financing proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would qualify as \u201ctax-exempt income,\u201d we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new \u201cresident enterprise\u201d classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC stockholders from transferring our shares. If we were treated as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d by the PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China, and our PRC tax may not be used as a credit to reduce our U.S. tax.\nWe and our stockholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises or other assets attributed to a Chinese establishment of a non-Chinese company, or immovable properties located in China owned by non-Chinese companies.\nIn October 2017, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Bulletin on Issues Concerning the Withholding of Non-PRC Resident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or Bulletin 37, which replaced the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises issued by the State Administration of Taxation on December 10, 2009, and partially replaced and supplemented rules under the Bulletin on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfers of Assets by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Bulletin 7, issued by the State Administration of Taxation on February 3, 2015. Pursuant to Bulletin 7, an \u201cindirect transfer\u201d of PRC assets, including a transfer of equity interests in an unlisted non-PRC holding company of a PRC resident enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of the underlying PRC assets, if such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax. According to Bulletin 7, \u201cPRC taxable assets\u201d include assets attributed to an establishment in China, immoveable properties located in China, and equity investments in PRC resident enterprises and any gains from the transfer of such asset by a direct holder, who is a non-PRC resident enterprise, would be subject to PRC enterprise income taxes. When determining whether there is a \u201creasonable commercial purpose\u201d of the transaction arrangement, features to be taken into consideration include: whether the main value of the equity interest of the relevant offshore enterprise derives from PRC taxable assets; whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise mainly consists of direct or indirect investment in China or if its income mainly derives from China; whether the offshore enterprise and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding PRC taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their actual function and risk exposure; the duration of existence of the business model and organizational structure; the replicability of the transaction by direct transfer of PRC taxable assets; and the tax situation of such indirect transfer and applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements. In the case of an indirect offshore transfer of assets of a PRC establishment, the resulting gain is to be included with the enterprise income tax filing of the PRC establishment or place of business being transferred, and may consequently be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Where the underlying transfer relates to immoveable properties located in China or to equity investments in a PRC resident enterprise, which is not related to a PRC establishment or place of business of a non-resident enterprise, a PRC enterprise income tax of 10% would apply, subject to available preferential tax treatment under applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements, and the party who is obligated to make the transfer payments has the withholding obligation. Pursuant to Bulletin 37, the withholding agent shall declare and pay the withheld tax to the competent tax authority in the place where such withholding agent is located within 7 days from the date of occurrence of the withholding obligation, while the transferor is required to declare and pay such tax to the competent tax authority within the statutory time limit according to Bulletin 7. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest. Both Bulletin 37 and Bulletin 7 do not apply to transactions of sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange where such shares were acquired from a transaction through a public stock exchange.\nThere is uncertainty as to the application of Bulletin 37 or previous rules under Bulletin 7. We face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions where PRC taxable assets are involved, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries or investments. Our company may be subject to filing obligations or taxes if our company is transferor in such transactions, and may be subject to withholding obligations if our company is transferee in such transactions, under Bulletin 37 and Bulletin 7. For transfer of shares in our company by investors that are non-PRC resident enterprises, our PRC subsidiary may be requested to assist in the filing under Bulletin 37 and Bulletin 7. As a result, we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Bulletin 37 and Bulletin 7 or to request the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these circulars, or to establish that our company should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, have agreements with third parties, and make most of our sales in China. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our subsidiaries, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our subsidiaries may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our subsidiaries liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic is not effectively controlled in a short period of time, our business operation and financial condition in the long-term may be materially and adversely affected as a result of any slowdown in economic growth, operation disruptions or other factors that we cannot predict.\nThe spread of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has caused different countries and cities to mandate curfews, including \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and closures of most non-essential businesses as well as other measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. All of our operating subsidiaries are located in China. Our Dalian facility\u2019s operations were suspended in November 2021 due to the COVID-19 containment measures adopted by the local government. Hitrans\u2019s production facility in Shangyu, Zhejiang was also temporarily closed from December 9 to 24, 2021 to comply with the local lockdown policy in response to a surge of COVID-19 cases. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our operations, it has had limited adverse impacts on our operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. We generated revenues of $52.7 million and $37.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had a net profit of $61.6 million and net loss of $7.8 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. However, the extent of the long-term adverse impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations is highly uncertain and depends on several factors, such as the duration, severity, and geographic spread of the pandemic, development of the testing and treatment and stimulus measures of the government, all of which are out of our control.\nGiven the uncertainty of the outbreak, the spread of COVID-19 may be prolonged and worsened, and we may be forced to scale back or even suspend our operations. As COVID-19 spreads outside China, the global economy is suffering a noticeable slowdown. As this outbreak persists, commercial activities throughout the world have been curtailed with decreased consumer spending, business operation disruptions, interrupted supply chain, difficulties in travel and reduced workforces. The duration and intensity of disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak is uncertain. It is unclear as to when the outbreak will be contained, and we also cannot predict if the impact will be short-lived or long-lasting. The extent to which outbreak impacts our long-term financial results will depend on its future developments. If the COVID-19 pandemic is not effectively controlled in a short period of time, our long-term business operation and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected as a result of any slowdown in economic growth, operation disruptions or other factors that we cannot predict.\nOur independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion issued in connection with our financial statements included in this annual report which states that the financial statements were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein, we had negative cash flows from operating activities, accumulated deficit from recurring net losses incurred for the prior years and significant short-term debt obligations maturing in less than one year as of December 31, 2021. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We plan to renew our bank borrowings upon maturity and raise additional funds through bank borrowings and equity financing to meet our daily cash demands. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the financing. The audited consolidated financial statements included in this report do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe acquisition of a controlling interest in Hitrans may fail to result in anticipated benefits but has involved significant investment and commitment of financial and other resources.\nWe consummated the acquisition of 81.56% of registered equity interests (representing 75.57% of paid-up capital) in Hitrans in November 2021. However, acquisitions generally create risks such as (i) the need to integrate and manage the businesses and products acquired with our own business and products; (ii) additional demands on our resources, systems, procedures and controls; (iii) disruption of our ongoing business; (iv) potential unknown or unquantifiable liabilities associated with the target company; and (v) diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Moreover, this acquisition involved substantial investment of funds from our previous equity financings, resulted in one-time charges and expenses and subjected us to contractual obligations to pay outstanding subscribed registered capital of Hitrans of RMB99.8 million by May 31, 2025. This acquisition may not be successful in generating revenue, income or other returns, and any resources we committed will not be available to us for other purposes. Moreover, if we are unable to access the capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, or generate sufficient operating income, we may not be able to perform our obligations to pay outstanding subscribed registered capital of Hitrans as agreed. Our inability to take advantage of growth opportunities or address risks associated with this acquisition and investment may negatively affect our operating results.\nAdditionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or charges to earnings associated with any acquisition or investment activity, may materially reduce our earnings. This acquisition may not result in its anticipated benefits, and we may not be able to properly integrate acquired products, technologies or businesses with our existing products and operations or successfully combine personnel and cultures. Failure to do so could deprive us of the intended benefits of this acquisition.\nThere are inherent risks associated with new product development and our efforts to develop and market new products could fail.\nIn June 2020, our wholly-owned subsidiary, BAK Asia entered into a framework investment agreement with Gaochun EDZ, pursuant to which intend to develop certain lithium battery projects which are expected to have a total production capacity of 8 GWh per year. We have put into operation a production line of model 32140 large-sized cylindrical \u201ctabless\u201d batteries with a production capacity of 0.7 GWh per year in 2021. Model 32140 batteries can be used in light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools and energy storage.\nHowever, we cannot provide assurance that market acceptance of this new product will occur due to the highly competitive nature of the business. The Company competes in the battery industry where there are frequent introductions of new products and line extensions and such product introductions often require significant investment and support. The ability of the Company to understand end user needs and preferences is key to maintaining and improving the competitiveness of its product offerings. The development and introduction of new products, as well as the renovation of current products and product lines, require substantial and effective research, development and marketing expenditures, which the Company may be unable to recoup if the new or renovated products do not gain widespread market acceptance. There are inherent risks associated with new product development and marketing efforts, including product development or launch delays, product performance issues during development, changing regulatory frameworks that affect the new products in development and the availability of key raw materials included in such products. These inherent risks could result in the failure of new products and product line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance, additional costs resulting from failed product introductions and the Company not being first to market. As the Company continues to focus on innovation and renovation of its products, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in the event that the Company is not able to effectively develop and introduce new or renovated products and line or brand extensions.\nOur failure, if any, to keep up with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards may cause our products to become obsolete and less marketable, resulting in loss of market share to our competitors.\nThe lithium-based battery market, as well as the battery materials industry, are characterized by changing technologies and evolving industry standards, which are difficult to predict. This, coupled with frequent introduction of new products and models, has shortened product life cycles and may render our products obsolete or unmarketable. Our ability to adapt to evolving industry standards and anticipate future standards will be a significant factor in maintaining and improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. To achieve this goal, we have invested and plan to continue investing significant financial resources in our R&D infrastructure. Currently, we have facilities in Dalian, Nanjing and Shaoxing, China, which have about 121 R&D staffers and over 4,000 square meters of space dedicated to R&D activities.\nR&D activities, however, are inherently uncertain, and we might encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results. Accordingly, our significant investment in our R&D infrastructure may not bear fruit. On the other hand, our competitors may improve their technologies or even achieve technological breakthroughs that would render our products obsolete or less marketable. Therefore, our failure to effectively keep up with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards by introducing new and enhanced products may cause us to lose our market share and to suffer a decrease in our revenue.\nOur efforts to enter into the light electric vehicle business could fail.\nOn September 24, 2020, our wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary, BAK Investments entered into a framework investment agreement with Gaochun EDZ, under which we intended to develop light electric vehicle projects. On November 9, 2020, we established our new subsidiary, Nanjing Daxin to launch and develop our light electric vehicle business.\nThere are risks and uncertainties associated with this effort, particularly given that the light electric vehicle market is evolving. In developing and commercializing this new line of business, we may have to invest significant time and resources. External factors, such as regulatory compliance obligations, competitive alternatives, lack of market acceptance and shifting market preferences, may also affect the successful implementation of this new line of business. Failure to successfully plan for and manage these risks in the development and implementation of this new line of business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaintaining our R&D activities and manufacturing operations require significant capital expenditures, and our inability or failure to maintain our operations could have a material adverse impact on our market share and ability to generate revenue.\nWe incurred capital expenditures of approximately $17.5 million and $19.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We may incur significant additional capital expenditures as a result of unanticipated expenses, regulatory changes and other events that impact our business. If we are unable or fail to timely obtain capital on acceptable terms and adequately maintain our manufacturing capacity, we could lose customers and there could be a material adverse impact on our market share and our ability to generate revenue.\nWe face intense competition from other battery manufacturers and cathode material and precursor producers, many of which have significantly greater resources.\nThe market for batteries used in electric vehicles and light electric vehicles is intensely competitive and is characterized by frequent technological changes and evolving industry standards. We expect competition to become more intense. Increased competition may result in declines in average selling prices, causing a decrease in gross profit margins. We have faced and will continue to face competition from manufacturers of traditional rechargeable batteries, such as lead-acid batteries other manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries, as well as from companies engaged in the development of batteries incorporating new technologies. Other manufacturers of high-power lithium batteries currently include Panasonic Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., LG Chem, Tianjin Lishen Battery Joint Stock Co., Ltd., Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited, BYD Co. Ltd, Hefei Guoxuan Hi-Tech Power Energy Co., Ltd and Shandong Goldencell Electronics Technology Co., Ltd.\nMany of these existing competitors have greater financial, personnel, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to market opportunities, new or emerging technologies and evolving industry standards. Many of our competitors are developing a variety of battery technologies, such as lithium polymer, prismatic cells and fuel cell batteries, which are expected to compete with our existing product lines. Other companies undertaking R&D activities of solid-polymer lithium-ion batteries have developed prototypes and are constructing commercial scale production facilities. It is possible that our competitors will be able to introduce new products with more desirable features than ours and their new products will gain market acceptance. If our competitors successfully do so, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position and our future success would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe market for cathode materials and precursors has been evolving rapidly. Rapid and ongoing changes in technology and product standards could render our cathode materials and precursor products less competitive, or even obsolete, particularly if we fail to continue to improve the performance of our cathode materials and precursor products. Competing technologies that outperform our cathode materials and precursor products in one or more performance attributes could be developed and successfully introduced. We are aware of certain companies, including Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd., Umicore N.V., Beijing Easpring Material Technology Co., Ltd. and Ningbo Ronbay Lithium Battery Material Co., Ltd. using cell chemistry technology similar to our technology and these or other companies have introduced or could introduce products that compete directly with our products and could in the future outperform our products in one or more performance attributes, could be offered to our customers as a cheaper alternative to our products or may result in increased pricing pressure on our products.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues and this dependence is likely to continue.\nWe have been dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 54.0% and 80.0% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Dependence on a few customers could make it difficult to negotiate attractive prices for our products and could expose us to the risk of substantial losses if a single dominant customer stops purchasing our products. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to contribute a significant portion of our sales in the near future. Our ability to maintain close relationships with these top customers is essential to the growth and profitability of our business. If we fail to sell our products to one or more of these top customers in any particular period, or if a large customer purchases fewer of our products, defers orders or fails to place additional orders with us, or if we fail to develop additional major customers, our revenue could decline, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to our own production, we also rely on a few battery suppliers to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders. If we fail to effectively manage our relationships with, or lose the services of these suppliers and we cannot substitute suitable alternative suppliers, our operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe generate part of our revenues by outsourcing some of our customers\u2019 orders to Zhengzhou BAK New Energy Vehicle Co., Ltd (\u201cBAK New Energy\u201d), Shenzhen BAK Battery Co., Ltd (\u201cShenzhen BAK\u201d) and a few other suppliers for certain battery models that we do not produce. If our business relationship with BAK New Energy, Shenzhen BAK and other suppliers changes negatively or their financial condition deteriorates, or their operating environment changes, our business may be harmed in many ways. BAK New Energy, Shenzhen BAK and other suppliers may also unilaterally terminate battery supply to us or increase the prices. As a result, we are not assured of an uninterrupted supply of certain types of high-power lithium batteries of acceptable quality or at acceptable prices from BAK New Energy, Shenzhen BAK or other suppliers. On the other hand, we may not be able to substitute them with suitable alternative contract manufacturers in a timely manner on commercially acceptable term or at all. We may be forced to default on the agreements with our customers. This may negatively impact our revenues and adversely affect our reputation and relationships with our customers, causing a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFailure by us to maintain and strengthen relationships with certain contract battery material producer may materially adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and our results of operations.\nWe outsource the production of a portion of our battery material products to a third-party supplier in Xianyang city, Shaanxi province. Our ability to meet the demands of our customers for battery material products would be affected, if our relationship with this supplier changes negatively, or operations at this supplier are disrupted. In the event of a significant disruption to the battery material production line of this supplier, our proprietary manufacturing facility in Shangyu, Zhejiang province, may not have sufficient production capacity to meet demand until the supplier\u2019s production line returns to operation. On the other hand, we may not be able to replace this supplier with suitable alternative contract manufacturers in a timely manner on commercially acceptable term or at all. We may be forced to default on orders with our customers. This could negatively impact our revenues and adversely affect our reputation and relationships with our customers, causing a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business depends on the growth in demand for light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, energy storage, such as UPS application, and other high-power electric devices.\nAs the demand for our battery cell and battery materials is directly related to the market demand for high-power electric devices, a fast-growing high-power electric devices market will be critical to the success of our business. In anticipation of an expected increase in the demand for high-power electric devices such as electric vehicles, light electric vehicles, electric tools, and energy storage including UPS application in the next few years, we are building new manufacturing facilities in Nanjing and have invested in the R&D capability of our newly acquired battery materials business. However, the markets we have targeted, primarily those in the PRC, may not achieve the level of growth we expect. If this market fails to achieve our expected level of growth, we may have excess production capacity and may not be able to generate enough revenue to maintain our profitability.\nOur success, in part, depends on the success of manufacturers of the end applications that use our products, and our failure to gain acceptance of our products from such manufacturers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nAs we target the battery markets for light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, energy storage including but not limited to UPS application, and other high-power electric devices, our future success in part depends on whether end-application manufacturers are willing to use batteries that incorporate our products. To secure acceptance of our products, we must constantly develop and introduce more reliable and cost-effective battery cells and battery materials with enhanced functionality to meet evolving industry standards. Our failure to gain acceptance of our products from these manufacturers could materially and adversely affect our future success. From 2017 to 2019, our electric vehicle customers included Dongfeng Autos, Dayun Motor and Yema Auto. Since then, however, our sales to electric vehicle customers have decreased significantly and we only generated approximately $0.2 million revenues from electric vehicle customers in 2021. On the other hand, we cannot guarantee that the market demand for the cathode materials and precursors will maintain the current growth rate.\nEven if a manufacturer decides to use batteries that incorporate our products, the manufacturer may not be able to market and sell its products successfully. The manufacturer\u2019s inability to market and sell its products successfully, whether from lack of market acceptance or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects because this manufacturer may not order new products from us. If we cannot achieve the expected level of sales, we will not be able to make sufficient profits to offset the expenditures we have incurred to expand our production capacity or develop new technologies, nor will we be able to grow our business. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future success would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe extend relatively long payment terms to some large customers.\nAs is customary in the battery industry in the PRC, we extend relatively long payment terms to some large customers. In 2021, it generally took 60 days for us to collect payments from our major customers. Due to the large size of many of our orders, these extended terms may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to fund our operations out of our operating cash flows.\nWhile our revenue grew by $15.1 million, or 40% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, our trade accounts and bills receivable increased by $20.3 million, or 69% as of December 31, 2021 compared to that as of December 31, 2020. Although we attempt to establish appropriate reserves for our receivables, those reserves may not prove to be adequate in view of large amounts of accounts receivable and actual levels of bad debts. The failure of our customers to pay us timely would negatively affect our working capital, which could in turn adversely affect our cash flows.\nOur customers often place large orders for products, requiring fast delivery, which impacts our working capital. If our customers do not incorporate our products into their products and sell them in a timely fashion, for example, due to excess inventories, sales slowdowns or other issues, they may not pay us in a timely fashion, even on our extended terms. Our customers\u2019 failure to pay may force us to defer or delay further product orders, which may adversely affect our cash flows, sales or income in subsequent periods.\nWe may not be able to accurately plan our production based on our sales contracts, which may result in excess product inventory or product shortages.\nOur sales contracts for battery cells typically provide for a non-binding, three-month forecast on the quantity of products that our customers may purchase from us. Our sales contracts for battery materials typically provide for a non-binding, two-month forecast on the quantity of products that our customers may purchase from us. We typically have only a 15-day to 30-day lead time to manufacture battery cell products and 25-day lead time to produce battery material products to meet our customers\u2019 requirements once our customers place orders with us. To meet the short delivery deadline, we generally make significant decisions on our production level and timing, procurement, facility requirements, personnel needs and other resources requirements based on our estimate in light of this forecast, our past dealings with such customers, market conditions and other relevant factors. Our customers\u2019 final purchase orders may not be consistent with our estimates. If the final purchase orders substantially differ from our estimates, we may have excess product inventory or product shortages. Excess product inventory could result in unprofitable sales or write-offs as our products are susceptible to obsolescence and price declines. Producing additional products to make up for any product shortages within a short time frame may be difficult, making us unable to fill out the purchase orders. In either case, our results of operation would fluctuate from period to period.\nWe may not be able to substantially increase our manufacturing output in order to maintain our cost competitiveness.\nWe believe that our ability to provide cost-effective products is one of the most significant factors that contributed to our past success and will be essential for our future growth. We believe this is one of our competitive advantages over our Japanese and Korean competitors. We need to increase our manufacturing output to a level that will enable us to substantially reduce the cost of our products on a per unit basis through economies of scale. However, our ability to substantially increase our manufacturing output is subject to significant constraints and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf the need to raise significant additional funds to purchase and prepay raw materials or to build additional manufacturing facilities, which we may be unable to obtain on reasonable terms or at all;\n\u25cf delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, many of which may be beyond our control, such as increases in raw material prices and problems with equipment vendors;\n\u25cf delays or denial of required approvals by relevant government authorities;\n\u25cf diversion of significant management attention and other resources; and\n\u25cf failure to execute our expansion plan effectively.\nIf we are unable to increase our manufacturing output because of any of the risks described above, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position or achieve the growth we expect. Moreover, even if we expand our manufacturing output, we may not be able to generate sufficient customer demand for our products to support our increased production output.\nWe may incur significant costs because of the warranties we supply with our battery cell products.\nWith respect to the sale of our battery products, we typically offer warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period of six months-to-eight years from the date of purchase, including a period of six to twenty-four months for battery cells, and a period of twelve to twenty-seven months for battery modules for electric bicycles, and a period of three years to eight years (or 120,000 or 200,000 km if reached sooner) for battery modules for electric vehicles. We provide a reserve for these potential warranty expenses, which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues. There is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history, and in the event that we experience a significant increase in warranty claims, there is no assurance that our reserves will be sufficient. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have product liability insurance for claims against our product quality. Defects in our products could result in a loss of customers and decrease in revenue, unexpected expenses and a loss of market share.\nWe have not purchased product liability insurance to provide against any claims against us based on our product quality. As a result, defects in our products could result in a loss of customers and decrease in revenue, unexpected expenses and a loss of market share, and any of our products are found to have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we will be required to accept returns, provide replacements, provide refunds, or pay damages. We may be required to incur substantial amounts to indemnify our customers in respect of their product quality claims against us, which would materially and adversely affect the results of our operations and severely damage our reputation.\nWe do not have insurance coverage against all the damages or losses of our facilities.\nWe currently have insurance coverage for certain pledged machinery and equipment and pledged buildings located at our facilities in Dalian. We expect we will purchase related insurance for the remaining buildings when we obtain their property ownership certificates. If we were to suffer any losses or damages to any of the facilities before the purchase of insurance policies that provide adequate coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, Hitrans maintains property insurance coverage against certain property and inventory damages and losses. However, such insurance may not adequately compensate it for any such losses and will not address a loss of customers as a result of property damages and consequent disruptions to operations or may have large deductibles insufficient to support its continuing operations. If damages or losses exceed the insurance coverage, it may not be able to return to operation for an extended period of time, potentially even threatening its viability. In addition, insurance coverage is expensive, may be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all. A significant increase in the cost of insurance coverage could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties to supply key raw materials and components to us. Failure to obtain a sufficient supply of these raw materials and components in a timely fashion and at reasonable costs could significantly delay our production and shipments, which would cause us to breach our sales contracts with our customers.\nWe purchase from Chinese domestic suppliers for certain key raw materials and components such as electrolytes, electrode materials and separators for our battery cell products and purchase from Chinese domestic suppliers for cobaltous sulfates, manganese sulfates, lithium hydroxides, lithium carbonates and liquid nickel sulfates. We have purchased raw materials and components on the basis of purchase orders. In the absence of firm and long-term contracts, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply of these raw materials and components from our existing suppliers or alternates in a timely fashion or at a reasonable cost. If we fail to secure a sufficient supply of key raw materials and components in a timely fashion, it would result in a significant delay in our production and shipments, which may cause us to breach our sales contracts with our customers. Furthermore, failure to obtain sufficient supply of these raw materials and components at a reasonable cost could also harm our revenue and gross profit margins.\nFluctuations in prices and availability of raw materials, particularly Ni, Co, Mn, Li2CO3, LiPF6 and LiFePO4, could increase our costs or cause delays in shipments, which would adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials, particularly Ni, Co, Mn, Li2CO3, LiPF6 and LiFePO4, the primary cost component of our battery products, battery material products or other product parts or components. The price of Ni, Co, Mn, Li2CO3, LiPF6 and LiFePO4 is not stable. For example, we recently experienced significant increases in the costs of nickel and cobalt, as a result of the current Ukrainian-Russian conflict, as well as in the cost of lithium carbonate due to large market demand and supply imbalance. Although we are not dependent on single suppliers for supply of raw materials, we mostly purchase raw materials through individual purchase orders or short-term contracts and not pursuant to long-term contracts. As such, our third-party suppliers may not be able to satisfy our requirements during a period of sustained or growing demand.\nIn addition, our battery cell products historically have not been able to fully offset the effects of higher costs of raw materials through price increases to customers or by way of productivity improvements. As a result, a significant increase in the price of one or more raw materials, parts or components or the inability to successfully implement price increases/surcharges to mitigate such cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which may result in significant uncertainties and volatility with respect to our revenue from period to period.\nWe do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers and the term of our sales contracts with our customers is typically one year or less. Furthermore, these contracts leave certain major terms such as price and quantity of products open to be determined in each purchase order. These contracts also allow parties to re-adjust the contract price for substantial changes in market conditions. As a result, if our customers hold stronger bargaining power than us or the market conditions are in their favor, we may not be able to enjoy the price downside protection or upside gain. Furthermore, our customers may decide not to continue placing purchase orders with us in the future at the same level as in prior periods. As a result, our results of operations may vary from period to period and may fluctuate significantly in the future.\nCompliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and our failure to comply with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a manufacturer, we are subject to various PRC environmental laws and regulations on air emission, wastewater discharge, solid waste and noise. Although we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current environmental laws and regulations, we may not be able to comply with these regulations at all times as the PRC environmental legal regime is evolving and becoming more stringent. Therefore, if the PRC government imposes more stringent regulations in the future, we will have to incur additional substantial costs and expenses in order to comply with new regulations, which may negatively affect our results of operations. If we fail to comply with any of the present or future environmental regulations in material aspects, we may suffer from negative publicity and may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend or even cease operations. Failure to comply with PRC environmental laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with the marketing, distribution and sale of our products internationally, and if we are unable to effectively manage these risks, they could impair our ability to expand our business abroad.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we derived 17% and 5.6%, respectively, of our sales from outside the PRC mainland. We deem overseas market as an important revenue source for us, and have been actively exploring overseas customers. The marketing, international distribution and sale of our products expose us to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf difficulty in engaging and retaining distributors that are knowledgeable about, and can function effectively in, overseas markets;\n\u25cf increased costs associated with maintaining marketing efforts in various countries;\n\u25cf difficulty and cost relating to compliance with the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas markets in which we offer our products;\n\u25cf inability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make us less competitive in some countries.\nOur business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lost their services.\nOur future success heavily depends on the continued service of our senior executives and other key employees. In particular, we rely on the expertise and experience of our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President Mr. Yunfei Li and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Xiangyu Pei. If one or more of our other senior executives are unable or unwilling to continue to work for us in their present positions, we may encounter similar problems, but on a compounded basis. Moreover, if any of our current or former senior executives joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. Each of our executive officers has entered into an employment agreement with us, which contains non-competition and confidentiality clauses. However, if any dispute arises between our current or former executive officers and the Company, it is hard to predict the extent to which any of these agreements could be enforced in China, where these executive officers reside, in light of the uncertainties with China\u2019s legal system.\nWe have experienced significant management changes which could increase our control risks and have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business and our results of operations.\nSince 2009, we have had a number of changes in our senior management, including multiple changes in our Chief Financial Officer. The magnitude of these past and potential changes and the short time interval in which they have occurred or may occur, particularly during a time of economic or financial crisis, add to the risks of control failures, including a failure in the effective operation of our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures. Control failures could result in material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. It may take time for the new management team to become sufficiently familiar with our business and each other to effectively develop and implement our business strategies. The turnover of key management positions could further harm our financial performance and results of operations. Management attention may be diverted from regular business concerns by reorganizations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to remediate the material weaknesses or maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our shares may be adversely affected.\nTo implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX 404, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. Under current law, we are subject to the requirement that we maintain internal controls and that management perform periodic evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal controls, assuming our filing status remains as a smaller reporting company. A report of our management is included under Item 9A of this annual report. Our management has identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting: we did not have appropriate policies and procedures in place to evaluate the proper accounting and disclosures of key documents and agreements, and there was insufficient accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have taken measures and plan to continue to take measures to remedy this material weakness. Since September 2016, we have regularly offered our financial personnel trainings on internal control and risk management. Since November 2016, we have regularly provided trainings to our financial personnel on U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines. However, the implementation of these measures may not fully address the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Our failure to address any control deficiency could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis. Moreover, effective internal control over financial reporting is important to prevent fraud. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the trading price of our shares, may be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMMON STOCK\nNumerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nThere are numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of common stock of CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. to fluctuate significantly. These factors include:\n\u25cf our earnings releases, actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, fluctuations in our operating results or our failure to meet the expectations of financial market analysts and investors;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover the common stock;\n\u25cf speculation about our business in the press or the investment community;\n\u25cf significant developments relating to our relationships with our customers or suppliers;\n\u25cf stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that are in our industries;\n\u25cf customer demand for our products;\n\u25cf investor perceptions of our industry in general and our company in particular;\n\u25cf the operating and stock performance of comparable companies;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and trends;\n\u25cf major catastrophic events;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new products, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretation or principles;\n\u25cf loss of external funding sources;\n\u25cf sales of our shares, including sales by our directors, officers or significant shareholders; and\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel.\nIn the past, shareholders of a public company often brought securities class action suits against the company following periods of instability in the market price of that company\u2019s securities. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management\u2019s attention and other resources from our business and operations, which could harm our results of operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nTechniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of the common stock of CBAK Energy Technology, Inc.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller\u2019s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.\nPublic companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result, a number of targets of such efforts are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.\nWe have become the subject of certain unfavorable allegations. Although we believe such allegations are untrue, inaccurate or inflated, we have expended resources to investigate such allegations and defend ourselves and we may need to expend more resources in connection with these allegations in the future, which could be costly and time-consuming and could distract our management from growing our business. The allegations against us may severely impact our stock price and disrupt our business operations. Any investment in the common stock of CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. could be greatly reduced or even rendered worthless due to such allegations.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited public market for shares of CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us.\nCBAK Energy Technology, Inc.\u2019s common stock is traded and listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cCBAT\u201d, which was changed from \u201cCBAK\u201d on November 30, 2018. The common stock may be delisted if we fail to maintain certain NASDAQ listing requirements.\nOn February 20, 2020, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for the common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share and as a result, CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. was no longer in compliance with the NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). We regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule on October 2, 2020.\nWe cannot assure you that CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. will continue to comply with the requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market in the future. If the common stock loses its status on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the common stock would likely trade in the over-the-counter market. If our shares were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling the common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts\u2019 coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event the common stock is delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in the common stock, further limiting the liquidity of the common stock. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for the common stock. Such delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions.\nYou may experience dilution to the extent that shares of the common stock are issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or other securities that CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. may issue in the future.\nYou may experience dilution to the extent that shares of the common stock are issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants of CBAK Energy Technology, Inc., and if CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. issues additional equity securities, or there are any issuances and subsequent exercises of stock options issued in the future.\nOn February 10, 2021, pursuant to that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated February 8, 2021, CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. issued to certain investors (i) in a private placement, Series A-1 warrants to purchase a total of 4,469,988 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.67 and exercisable for 42 months from the date of issuance; (ii) in a registered direct offering, certain Series B warrants to purchase a total of 4,469,988 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.83 and exercisable for 90 days from the date of issuance; and (iii) in the registered direct offering, certain Series A-2 warrants to purchase up to 2,234,992 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.67 and exercisable for 45 months from the date of issuance. On May 10, 2021, we entered into that Amendment No. 1 to the Series B Warrant with each of the holders of the Series B warrants, pursuant to which the expiration date of the Series B warrants was extended from May 11, 2021 to August 31, 2021. On September 1, 2021, all of the Series B warrants and Series A-2 warrants had expired.\nPrior to that, in December 2020, CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. issued to the same investors warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,795,920 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.46 per share. These warrants are exercisable until 36 months after the date of issuance. The exercise prices of all of the above warrants are subject to full-ratchet anti-dilution adjustment in the case of future issuances or deemed issuances of shares of common stock below the warrants\u2019 exercise price then in effect, as well as customary adjustment in case of stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and similar recapitalization transactions. In addition, CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. issued to Mr. Jian Ke placement agent warrants to purchase up to 379,592 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.475 per share in December 2020 and the placement agent warrant to purchase up to 446,999 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $9.204 per share in February 2021. These warrants also bear customary anti-dilution protections in the event of stock dividends or splits, business combination, sale of assets, similar recapitalization transactions, or other similar transactions.\nOur directors and executive officers, collectively, own approximately 12.78% of outstanding common stock of CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. and may possess significant influence in or control over our management and affairs.\nMr. Yunfei Li, our president and chief executive officer and chairman of our board, and our other executive officers and directors beneficially own an aggregate of 12.78% of outstanding common stock of CBAK Energy Technology, Inc. as of April 9, 2022. As a result, our directors and executive officers, acting together, may have significant influence in or control over our management and affairs, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidation, and sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, even if such a change of control would benefit our stockholders.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nIf we cannot continue to develop new products in a timely manner, and at favorable margins, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe battery industry has been notable for the pace of innovations in product life, product design and applied technology. We have made, and will continue to make, investments in research and development with the goal of further innovation. The successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions face the uncertainty of customer acceptance and reaction from competitors, as well as the possibility of cannibalization of sales of our existing products. In addition, our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can:\n\u25cf develop and fund research and technological innovations;\n\u25cf receive and maintain necessary intellectual property protections;\n\u25cf obtain governmental approvals and registrations;\n\u25cf comply with governmental regulations; and\n\u25cf anticipate customer needs and preferences successfully.\nThe failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could also compromise our competitive position. If competitors introduce new or enhanced products that significantly outperform ours, or if they develop or apply manufacturing technology which permits them to manufacture at a significantly lower cost relative to ours, we may be unable to compete successfully in the market segments affected by these changes.\nA change in our product mix may cause our results of operations to differ substantially from the anticipated results in any particular period.\nOur overall profitability may not meet expectations if our products, customers or geographic mix are substantially different than anticipated. Our profit margins vary among products, customers and geographic markets. Consequently, if our mix of any of these is substantially different from what is anticipated in any particular period, our profitability could be lower than anticipated.\nManufacturing or use of our products may cause accidents, which could result in significant production interruption, delay or claims for substantial damages.\nDue to the high energy density inherent in lithium-based batteries, our batteries can pose certain safety risks, including the risk of fire. Although we incorporate safety procedures in the research, development, manufacture and transportation of batteries that are designed to minimize safety risks, the manufacture or use of our products may still cause accidents. Any accident, whether occurring at the manufacturing facilities or from the use of our products, may result in significant production interruption, delays or claims for substantial damages caused by personal injuries or property damages.\nWe may face impairment charges if economic environments in which our businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions substantially change.\nAssessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets is an integral part of our normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of long-lived assets is dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects our best estimates at a particular point in time, which may vary from testing date to testing date. The economic environments in which our businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected product selling prices and materials costs, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on both the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized. Future changes in the economic environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in impairment charges. Any significant asset impairments would adversely impact our financial results.\nWe may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties, which, if determined adversely to us, could cause our loss of significant rights and inability to continue providing our existing product offerings.\nOur success also depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and know-how without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. The validity and scope of claims relating to lithium-ion battery technology patents involve complex scientific, legal and factual questions and analysis and, therefore, may be highly expensive and time-consuming. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages to the party claiming infringement, develop non-infringing technologies or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business. Protracted litigation could result in our customers, or potential customers, deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products until resolution of such litigation. Parties making the infringement claim may also obtain an injunction that can prevent us from selling our products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing contents. Any intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled employees and key personnel.\nBecause of the highly specialized, technical nature of our business, we must attract, train and retain a sizable workforce comprising highly skilled employees and other key personnel. Since our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, we may have to pay higher salaries and wages and provide greater benefits in order to attract and retain highly skilled employees or other key personnel that we will need to achieve our strategic objectives. Our ability to train and integrate new employees into our operations may not meet the requirements of our growing business. Our failure to attract, train or retain highly skilled employees and other key personnel in numbers that are sufficient to satisfy our needs would materially and adversely affect our business.\nIf we become directly subject to the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nU.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China, particularly companies like us which have completed so-called reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies have also been subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions, and have been conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our company. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our company and business operations will be severely and your investment in our stock could be rendered worthless.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that is located in China where substantially all of our operations and business are located have conducted any due diligence on our operations or reviewed or cleared any of our disclosures.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Unlike public reporting companies whose operations are located primarily in the United States, however, substantially all of our operations are located in China. Since substantially all of our operations and business take place in China, it may be more difficult for the Staff of the SEC to overcome the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present when reviewing our disclosures. These same obstacles are not present for similar companies whose operations or business take place entirely or primarily in the United States. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other disclosures and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review of China Securities Regulatory Commission, a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on our company and with the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements has been reviewed or otherwise been scrutinized by any local regulator.", "PERMNO": 91269, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "CBAT"}
