{"cik": "1779128", "company": "Blade Air Mobility, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-12-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock. You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties in this Annual Report are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may become material and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock and warrants.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Growth Strategy\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We expect to incur losses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. While we currently generate revenue from the sale of air transportation, it is difficult for us to predict our future operating results. As a result, our losses may be larger than anticipated, and we may not achieve profitability when expected, or at all. Even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability. Further, our future growth is heavily dependent upon the availability of EVA. There can be no assurance that regulatory approval and availability of EVA, or consumer acceptance of EVA, will occur in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, there may be additional costs associated with the initial build out of EVA infrastructure needed to service our routes and we cannot be sure that EVA will result in expected cost savings or efficiencies, which could in turn affect our profitability.\nThe duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar public health threats that we may face in the future, could result in additional adverse effects on our business operations and our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak, along with the measures governments and private organizations worldwide have implemented in an attempt to contain the spread of this pandemic, have resulted in a severe decline in demand for air travel and have adversely affected our business, operations and financial condition to an unprecedented extent. Measures such as travel restrictions, \u201cshelter in place\u201d and quarantine orders, limitations on public gatherings, cancellation of public events, and many other restrictions resulted in a precipitous decline in demand for business and leisure travel generally during 2020 and the first half of calendar year 2021, including demand for our air mobility services. For example, historically our business has been comprised of business travel and commuter traffic, which during the height of the pandemic was largely replaced by \u201cvirtual meeting\u201d and teleconferencing products or became unnecessary as a result of the significant number of people now working from home.\nThe full extent of the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our long-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside our control, including the duration and spread of COVID-19, the availability and acceptance of vaccines, travel advisories, curfews or \u201cshelter in place\u201d health orders, the impact of COVID-19 on overall long-term demand for air travel, increasing acceptance of employees working from home, government mandates restricting air service, sickness or quarantine of our employees or third-party aircraft operators resulting from exposure to COVID-19, and the impact of COVID-19 on the financial health and operations of our business partners, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this time, we are not able to predict whether the COVID-19 pandemic will result in permanent changes to our customers\u2019 behavior or their demand for our urban air mobility services.\nThe recent spread of the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19, which appear to be more transmissible than other variants to date, may extend the impact of COVID-19 on our business. The impact of these variants cannot be predicted at this time and could depend on numerous factors, including vaccination rates among the population, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against emerging variants, and any new measures that may be introduced by governments or other parties in response to an increase in COVID-19 cases and what impact they may have on commuting patterns and the demand for air travel. Given the dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nThe markets for our offerings are still in relatively early stages of growth, and if such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect, or fail to grow as large as we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBlade\u2019s urban air mobility service has grown rapidly since we launched our business in 2014, though it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at all.\nFurther, we currently operate in a limited number of metropolitan areas. The success of these markets to date and the opportunity for future growth in these markets may not be representative of the potential market for urban air mobility in other metropolitan areas. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on regulatory approval and availability of EVA technology, as well as the willingness of commuters and travelers to widely adopt urban air mobility as an alternative for ground transportation. If the public does not perceive urban air mobility as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt urban air mobility as a result of concerns regarding safety, affordability, or for other reasons, then the market for our offerings may not further develop, may develop more slowly than we expect, or may not achieve the growth potential we expect, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe New York airport transfer market has not been served on a by-the-seat air transportation basis since U.S. Helicopter offered helicopter service in the 2000s. Furthermore, some of the other markets where we plan to expand have never had by-the-seat helicopter services. As a result, the number of potential fliers using our urban air mobility services cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to operate in a profitable manner in any of our current or targeted future markets.\nGrowth of our business will require significant investments in our infrastructure, technology, and marketing and sales efforts. Historically, cash flow from operations has not been sufficient to support these needs. If our business does not generate the level of available cash flow required to support these investments, our results of operations will be negatively affected. Further, our ability to effectively manage growth and expansion of our operations will also require us to enhance\nour operational systems, internal controls and infrastructure, human resources policies, and reporting systems. These enhancements will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources.\nThe success of our business will be highly dependent on our ability to effectively market and sell air transportation as a substitute for conventional methods of transportation.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of air transportation. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to cost-effectively attract new fliers, retain existing fliers, and increase utilization of our platform by existing fliers. Historically, we have made, and expect that we will need to continue to make, significant investments and implement strategic initiatives in order to attract new fliers, such as flier acquisition campaigns and the launching of new scheduled routes. For example, for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, selling and marketing costs represented approximately 7% and 11% of our revenues, respectively. These investments and initiatives may not be effective in generating sales growth or profits. In addition, marketing campaigns can be expensive and may not result in the acquisition of additional fliers in a cost-effective manner, if at all. As our brand becomes more widely known, future marketing campaigns or brand content may not attract new fliers at the same rate as past campaigns or brand content. If we are unable to attract new fliers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur fliers have a wide variety of options for transportation, including business aviation, commercial airlines, private aircraft operators, personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis, public transit, and ride-sharing offerings. To expand our flier base, we must appeal to new fliers who have historically used other forms of transportation. If fliers do not perceive our urban air mobility services to be reliable, safe, and cost-effective, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform, we may not be able to attract or retain fliers or increase their utilization of our platform. If we fail to continue to grow our flier base, retain existing fliers, or increase the overall utilization of our platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe EVA industry may not continue to develop, EVA may not be adopted by the market or our third-party aircraft operators, EVA may not be certified by transportation authorities, or EVA may not deliver the expected reduction in operating costs, any of which could adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEVA involves a complex set of technologies, which we rely on original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) to develop and our third-party aircraft operators to adopt. However, before EVA can fly passengers, OEMs must receive requisite approvals from federal transportation authorities. No EVA aircraft are currently certified by the FAA for commercial operations in the United States, and there is no assurance that OEM research and development will result in government certified aircraft that are market-viable or commercially successful in a timely manner, or at all. In order to gain government certification, the performance, reliability, and safety of EVA must be proven, none of which can be assured. Even if EVA aircraft are certified, individual operators must conform EVA aircraft to their licenses, which requires FAA approval, and individual pilots also must be licensed and approved by the FAA to fly EVA aircraft, which could contribute to delays in any widespread use of EVA and potentially limit the number of EVA operators available to our business.\nAdditional challenges to the adoption of EVA, all of which are outside of our control, include:\n\u2022market acceptance of EVA;\n\u2022state, federal, or municipal licensing requirements and other regulatory measures;\n\u2022necessary changes to infrastructure to enable adoption, including installation of necessary charging equipment; and\n\u2022public perception regarding the safety of EVA.\nThere are a number of existing laws, regulations, and standards that may apply to EVA, including standards that were not originally intended to apply to electric aircraft. Regulatory changes that address EVA more specifically could delay the ability of OEMs to receive type certification by transportation authorities and thus delay our third-party aircraft operators\u2019 ability to utilize EVA for our flights. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market will accept EVA, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy, or that our offerings utilizing EVA will be successful in the market. There may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent technology and its adopters. In particular, there could be negative public perception surrounding EVA, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries or death occurring as a result of\naccidents involving EVA, regardless of whether any such safety incidents occur involving Blade. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to successfully enter into new markets and offer new routes and services and enhance our existing offerings, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur growth will depend in part on our ability to successfully enter into new markets, create and introduce new routes, and expand our existing routes by adding more frequent flights. Significant changes to our existing routes or the introduction of new and unproven routes may require us to obtain and maintain applicable permits, authorizations, or other regulatory approvals. If these new or expanded routes are unsuccessful or fail to attract a sufficient number of fliers to be profitable, or we are unable to bring new or expanded routes to market efficiently, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, new third-party aircraft operator or flier demands regarding our services, including the availability of superior routes or a deterioration in the quality of our existing routes, could negatively affect the attractiveness of our platform and the economics of our business and require us to make substantial changes to and additional investments in our routes or our business model.\nDeveloping and launching new routes or enhancements to our existing routes involves significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to the reception of such routes by existing and potential future third-party aircraft operators and fliers, increases in operational complexity, unanticipated delays or challenges in implementing such routes or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of our ability to accurately forecast flier demand and the number of third-party aircraft operators using our platform), and negative publicity in the event such new or enhanced routes are perceived to be unsuccessful. We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new initiatives have in the past resulted in such operational challenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching new routes and enhancements to our existing routes may involve significant upfront investment, such as additional marketing and terminal build out, and such investments may not generate return on investment. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified third-party aircraft operators and fliers and our ability to increase utilization of our routes and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOperation of aircraft involves a degree of inherent risk. We could suffer losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving small aircraft, helicopters, or charter flights and, in particular, from any accident involving our third-party aircraft operators.\nThe operation of aircraft is subject to various risks, and demand for air transportation, including our urban air mobility services, has and may in the future be impacted by accidents or other safety issues regardless of whether such accidents or issues involve Blade flights, our third-party aircraft operators, or aircraft flown by our third-party aircraft operators. Air transportation hazards, such as adverse weather conditions and fire and mechanical failures, may result in death or injury to personnel and passengers which could impact client or passenger confidence in a particular aircraft type or the air transportation services industry as a whole and could lead to a reduction in passenger volume, particularly if such accidents or disasters were due to a safety fault. Safety statistics for air travel are reported by multiple parties, including the Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) and National Transportation Safety Board (\u201cNTSB\u201d), and are often separated into categories of transportation. Because our urban air mobility services include a variety of transportation methods, fliers may have a hard time determining how safe urban air mobility services are, and their confidence in urban air mobility may be impacted by, among other things, the classification of accidents in ways that reflect poorly on urban air mobility services or the transportation methods urban air mobility services utilize.\nWhile we do not own, operate or maintain aircraft, we believe that safety and reliability are two of the primary attributes fliers consider when selecting air transportation services. Our failure, or that of our third-party operators, to maintain standards of safety and reliability that are satisfactory to our fliers may adversely impact our ability to retain current customers and attract new customers. We are at risk of adverse publicity stemming from any public incident involving our company, our people, or our brand. Such an incident could involve the actual or alleged behavior of any of our employees or third-party aircraft operators. Further, if our personnel, one of our third-party operators\u2019 aircraft, one of our third-party operators\u2019 Blade-branded aircraft, or a type of aircraft in our third-party operators\u2019 fleet that is used by us is involved in a public incident, accident, catastrophe, or regulatory enforcement action, we could be exposed to significant reputational harm and potential legal liability. The insurance we carry may be inapplicable or inadequate to cover any such incident, accident, catastrophe, or action. In the event that our insurance is inapplicable or inadequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an incident or accident. In addition, any such incident, accident, catastrophe, or action involving our employees, one of the Blade-branded aircraft used by us belonging to our third-party operators\u2019 fleet (or personnel and\naircraft of our third-party operators), or the same type of aircraft as used by our third-party operators could create an adverse public perception, which could harm our reputation, resulting in air travelers being reluctant to use our services and adversely impacting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If one or more of our third-party aircraft operators were to suffer an accident or lose the ability to fly certain aircraft due to safety concerns or investigations, we may be required to cancel or delay certain flights until replacement aircraft and personnel are obtained.\nOur operations may also be negatively impacted by accidents or other safety-related events or investigations that occur in or near the airports and heliports we utilize for our urban air mobility services. For example, if an accident were to occur at a heliport we rely on for certain flights, we may be unable to fly into or out of that heliport until the accident has been cleared, any damages to the facilities have been repaired, and any insurance, regulatory, or other investigations have be completed.\nWe expect to face intense competition in the urban air mobility industry.\nThe urban air mobility industry is still developing and evolving, but we expect it to be highly competitive. Our potential competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development of their current and future technologies or the promotion and sale of their offerings, or offer lower prices. For example, some multimodal transportation providers have expressed interest in air mobility, and Uber Technologies, Inc. has a significant investment in a company that is developing EVA aircraft. Moreover, potential manufacturers of EVAs may choose to develop vertically integrated businesses, or they may contract with competing air mobility service providers rather than entering into operating contracts with us, which would be a threat to our business. Our potential competitors also may establish cooperative or strategic relationships among themselves or with third parties, including regional or national helicopter or heliport operations that we rely on to offer our urban air mobility services, which may further enhance their resources and offerings. It is possible that domestic or foreign companies or governments, some with greater experience in the urban air mobility industry or greater financial resources than we possess, will seek to provide products or services that compete directly or indirectly with ours in the future. Any such foreign competitor could benefit from subsidies or other protective measures provided by its home country.\nWe believe our ability to compete successfully as an urban air mobility service will depend on a number of factors, which may change in the future due to increased competition, including the price of our offerings, consumer confidence in the safety of our offerings, consumer satisfaction for the experiences we offer, and the routes, frequency of flights, and availability of seats offered through our platform. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we experience harm to our reputation and brand, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nContinuing to increase the strength of our reputation and brand for reliable, experience-driven, and cost-effective urban air mobility is critical to our ability to attract and retain qualified, third-party aircraft operators and fliers. In addition, our growth strategy includes international expansion through joint ventures, minority investments, or other partnerships with local companies as well as event activations and cross-marketing with other established brands, all of which benefit from our reputation and brand recognition.\nThe successful development of our reputation and brand will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Negative perception of our platform or company may harm our reputation and brand, including as a result of:\n\u2022complaints or negative publicity or reviews about us, our third-party aircraft operators, fliers, our air mobility services, other brands or events we associate with, or our flight operations policies (e.g., cancellation or baggage fee policies), even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents;\n\u2022changes to our flight operations, safety and security, privacy or other policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, or inconsistent with their values;\n\u2022a failure to enforce our flight operations policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\n\u2022illegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by fliers, our third-party aircraft operators, or other third parties involved in the operation of our business or by our management team or other employees;\n\u2022a failure to provide routes and flight schedules sought by fliers;\n\u2022actual or perceived disruptions or defects in our platform, such as data security incidents, platform outages, payment processing disruptions, or other incidents that impact the availability, reliability, or security of our offerings;\n\u2022litigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our operations or those of our third-party aircraft operators;\n\u2022a failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values;\n\u2022inadequate or unsatisfactory flier support service experiences;\n\u2022negative responses by third-party aircraft operators or fliers to new mobility offerings on our platform;\n\u2022perception of our treatment of employees, contractors, or third-party aircraft operators and our response to their sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; or\n\u2022any of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects the public\u2019s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIn addition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our offerings and balance the needs and interests of our third-party aircraft operators and fliers may be viewed positively from one group\u2019s perspective (such as fliers) but negatively from another\u2019s perspective (such as third-party aircraft operators), or may not be viewed positively by either third-party aircraft operators or fliers. If we fail to balance the interests of third-party aircraft operators and fliers or make changes that they view negatively, third-party aircraft operators and fliers may stop using our platform or take fewer flights, any of which could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny failure to offer high-quality customer support may harm our relationships with fliers and could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThrough our marketing, advertising, and communications with fliers, we set the tone for our brand as aspirational but also within reach. We strive to create high levels of flier satisfaction through the experience we provide in our terminal lounges and the support provided by our Flier Experience team and Flier Relations representatives. The ease and reliability of our offerings, including our ability to provide high-quality flier support, helps us attract and retain fliers. Fliers depend on our Flier Relations team to resolve any issues relating to our services, such as leaving something in a third-party aircraft operator\u2019s vehicle, flight cancellations, or scheduling changes. Our ability to provide effective and timely support is largely dependent on our ability to attract and retain skilled Flier Relations employees who can support fliers and are sufficiently knowledgeable about our services. As we continue to grow our business and improve our platform, we will face challenges related to providing quality support at scale. Any failure to provide efficient flier support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are especially vulnerable to delays, cancellations, or flight rescheduling, as we rely on maintaining a high daily aircraft usage rate, and need to aggregate fliers on our by-the-seat flights to lower direct costs to third-party operators.\nOur success depends in part on maintaining a high daily aircraft usage rate (i.e., the number of revenue generating hours flown on average in a day), which can be achieved in part by reducing turnaround times at heliports and airports. Aircraft usage rate is reduced by delays caused by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, security requirements, air traffic congestion, and unscheduled maintenance. Reduced aircraft usage rates may limit our ability to achieve and maintain profitability as well as lead to customer dissatisfaction.\nOur success also depends on our ability to generate more revenue per flight by maintaining high flier utilization rates (i.e., the number of seats purchased on each flight). Flier utilization rates may be reduced by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new routes or schedules. In some cases, we may choose to offer flights with low flier utilization rates to increase or maintain flier satisfaction and brand recognition and for marketing or other purposes. We have utilized monthly and annual commuter passes and annual corporate bulk purchasing options to increase our flier utilization rates in the past. However, these products may be less appealing following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile historically we have maintained daily aircraft and flier utilization rates sufficient to offset the costs we pay to operators, we may be unable to resume our pre-COVID-19 utilization rates or maintain and increase utilization rates as our\nbusiness grows and expands. The risk of delays, cancellations, and flight rescheduling, which could negatively impact our utilization rates, may increase as we expand our business to include new markets and destinations, more frequent flights on current routes, and expanded facilities.\nOur prospects and operations may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences, discretionary spending, and other economic conditions that affect demand for our services.\nOur business is primarily concentrated on urban air mobility, which is vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences, discretionary spending, and other market changes impacting luxury goods and discretionary purchases. The global economy has in the past, and will in the future, experience recessionary periods and periods of economic instability, including the current business disruption and related financial impact resulting from the global COVID-19 health crisis. During such periods, our current and future users may choose not to make discretionary purchases or may reduce overall spending on discretionary purchases. Such changes could result in reduced consumer demand for air transportation, including our urban air mobility services, or could shift demand from our urban air mobility services to other methods of air or ground transportation for which we do not offer a competing service. If we are unable to generate demand or there is a future shift in consumer spending away from urban air mobility, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operations are concentrated in a small number of metropolitan areas and airports which makes our business particularly susceptible to natural disasters, outbreaks and pandemics, economic, social, weather, growth constraints, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances affecting these metropolitan areas.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue, and the vast majority of our Short Distance revenue, from flights that either originate from or fly into heliports and airports in New York, New York. The remainder of our Short Distance flights primarily originate or fly into airports and heliports in Los Angeles, California, Miami, Florida, Nantucket, Massachusetts, and other locations in New York State. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are particularly susceptible to natural disasters, outbreaks and pandemics, economic, social, weather, growth constraints, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these metropolitan areas. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of the terminals where we have a significant volume of flights could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nDisruption of operations at the airports where our terminal facilities are located, whether caused by labor relations, utility or communications issues or fuel shortages, could harm our business. Certain airports may regulate flight operations, such as limiting the number of landings per year, which could reduce our operations. Bans on our airport operations or the introduction of any new permitting requirements would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, demand for our urban air mobility services could be impacted if drop-offs or pick-ups of fliers become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive for fliers because of airport-imposed fees, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur concentration in large metropolitan areas and heavily trafficked airports also makes our business susceptible to an outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, Zika virus, COVID-19, or any other similar illness, both due to the risk of a contagious disease being introduced into the metropolitan area through the high volume of travelers flying into and out of such airports and the ease at which contagious diseases can spread through densely populated areas, as seen with the spread of COVID-19 in Los Angeles, California and New York, New York.\nNatural disasters, including tornados, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, and severe weather conditions, such as heavy rains, strong winds, dense fog, blizzards, or snowstorms, may damage our facilities, those of third-party aircraft operators, or otherwise disrupt flights into or out of the airports from which our flights arrive or depart. For example, our New York and Massachusetts operations are subject to severe winter weather conditions, and our Miami operations are subject to tropical storms and hurricanes. Less severe weather conditions, such as rainfall, snowfall, fog, mist, freezing conditions, or extreme temperatures, may also impact the ability for flights to occur as planned, which could reduce our sales and profitability and may result in additional expenses related to rescheduling of flights.\nMajor metropolitan areas, including those in which we currently operate, are also at risk of terrorist attacks, actual or threatened acts of war, political disruptions, and other disruptions.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, severe weather events, epidemic or pandemic outbreaks, terrorist attacks, or disruptive political events in regions where our facilities are located, or where our third-party aircraft operators\u2019 facilities are located, could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with climate change, including the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure.\nAll climate change-related regulatory activity and developments may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, make capital investments to modernize certain aspects of our operations, purchase carbon offsets, or otherwise pay for our emissions. Such activity may also impact us indirectly by increasing our operating costs.\nThe potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, fires, fog, mist, freezing conditions, sea-level rise, and other climate-related events, could affect our operations, infrastructure, and financial results. Operational impacts, such as the delay or cancellation of flights, could result in loss of revenue. In addition, certain of our terminals are in locations susceptible to the impacts of storm-related flooding and sea-level rise, which could result in costs and loss of revenue. We could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate such physical effects of climate change. We are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change.\nSince we do not yet utilize electric aircraft, our business is dependent on the availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of significant disruption in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on consumer demand, our operating results, and liquidity.\nAlthough our third-party aircraft operators are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, we cannot predict the future availability. Natural disasters (including hurricanes or similar events in the U.S. Southeast and on the Gulf Coast where a significant portion of domestic refining capacity is located), political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, economic sanctions imposed against oil- producing countries or specific industry participants, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in the cost to transport or store petroleum products, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages or distribution challenges in the future. Any of these factors or events could cause a disruption in or increased demands on oil production, refinery operations, pipeline capacity, or terminal access and possibly result in diminished availability of aircraft fuel supply for our third-party aircraft operators. The impact of such events may limit our third-party aircraft operators\u2019 ability to perform our by-the-seat flights, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our ability to provide our services.\nSystem failures, defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our website, applications, backend systems, or other technology systems or those of third-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions, outages, or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, human error, or malfeasance by third parties or our employees, contractors, or service providers, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, or other events. Our insurance may not be sufficient, and we may not have sufficient remedies available to us from our third-party service providers, to cover all of our losses that may result from such interruptions, outages, or degradation.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as \u201ccontinuous deployment,\u201d which refers to the frequent release of our software code, sometimes multiple times per day. This practice increases the risk that errors and vulnerabilities are present in the software code underlying our platform. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our platform, whether in our proprietary code or that of third-party software on which our software relies, could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue, access or other performance issues,\nsecurity incidents, or other liabilities. Such vulnerabilities could also prevent fliers from booking flights, which would adversely affect our flier utilization rates, or disrupt communications with our operators (e.g., flight schedules or passenger manifests), which could affect our on-time performance. For example, we have experienced an error in our app that temporarily allowed a small number of users to log into and view a different user\u2019s profile. Although we quickly corrected the error after receiving user complaints, with no material adverse impact to our business, similar and more serious errors could occur in the future. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations as well as negatively impact our reputation or brand.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our technology platform. These events have resulted in, and similar future events could result in, losses of revenue due to increased difficulty of booking services through our technology platform, impacts to on-time performance, and resultant errors in operating our business. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability or other functionality of our platform could adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of fliers. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in harm or losses to the fliers using our platform, such as the inability to book or change flights because of a system failure, we may make voluntary payments to compensate for such harm, or the affected users could seek monetary recourse or contractual remedies from us for their losses. Such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly for us to address.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business. A cyber-based attack of these systems could disrupt our ability to deliver services to our customers and could lead to increased overhead costs, decreased sales, and harm to our reputation.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to operate and manage our business. Our information technology networks and systems process, transmit and store personal and financial information, proprietary information of our business, and also allow us to coordinate our business across our operation bases, and allow us to communicate with our employees and externally with customers, suppliers, partners, and other third parties. While we believe we take reasonable steps to secure these information technology networks and systems, and the data processed, transmitted, and stored thereon, such networks, systems, and data may be susceptible to cyberattacks, viruses, malware, or other unauthorized access or damage (including by environmental, malicious, or negligent acts), which could result in unauthorized access to, or the release and public exposure of, our proprietary information or our users\u2019 personal information. In addition, cyberattacks, viruses, malware, or other damage or unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems, could result in damage, disruptions, or shutdowns to our platform. Any of the foregoing could cause substantial harm to our business, require us to make notifications to our customers, governmental authorities, or the media, and could result in litigation, investigations or inquiries by government authorities, or subject us to penalties, fines, and other losses relating to the investigation and remediation of such an attack or other unauthorized access or damage to our information technology systems and networks.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our apps available to users of our platform. If we do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such application marketplaces and maintain high user reviews, our usage or brand recognition could decline and our business, financial results, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application marketplaces to make our platform available to fliers. In 2019, the majority of our seats were booked through the Blade Android and iOS apps. Such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces could limit or prohibit us from making our apps available to fliers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our apps, increase the difficulty of using our apps, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us. Additionally, if any future competitor\u2019s placement in such mobile operating system\u2019s application marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our apps, overall growth in our flier base could slow and the usage of our platform could be adversely affected. Our apps have experienced fluctuations in the number of downloads in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will continue to support our platform or effectively roll out updates to our apps. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality apps, we need\nto ensure that our offerings are designed to work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile technology industry to make, or continue to make, such technologies, systems, networks, or standards available to our users. If fliers on our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our apps on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose market share, generate reduced revenue, and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, including certain technologies we utilize in arranging air transportation. To date, we have relied primarily on trade secrets and trademarks to protect our proprietary technology. Our software is also subject to certain protection under copyright law, though we have chosen not to register any of our copyrights. We routinely enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, third party aircraft operators, and other relevant persons and take other measures to protect our intellectual property rights, such as limiting access to our trade secrets and other confidential information. We intend to continue to rely on these and other means, including patent protection, in the future. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate, and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary and, if successful, may potentially cause us to lose market share, harm our ability to compete, and result in reduced revenue. Moreover, our non- disclosure agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products, and there can be no assurance that our competitors or third parties will comply with the terms of these agreements, or that we will be able to successfully enforce such agreements or obtain sufficient remedies if they are breached. There can be no assurance that the intellectual property rights we own or license will provide competitive advantages or will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors.\nFurther, obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright, and trademark protection can be costly, and we may choose not to, or may fail to, pursue or maintain such forms of protection for our technology in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, which could harm our ability to maintain our competitive advantage in such jurisdictions. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our technology before it is too late to obtain patent protection, that we will be unable to devote the resources to file and prosecute all patent applications for such technology, or that we will inadvertently lose protection for failing to comply with all procedural, documentary, payment, and similar obligations during the patent prosecution process. The laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries may be inadequate to prevent other parties from infringing our proprietary technology. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized use of our technologies and proprietary information may increase. We may also fail to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property, or be required to expend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, including engaging in litigation, which may be costly, time-consuming, and divert the attention of management and resources, and may not ultimately be successful. If we fail to meaningfully establish, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe use open source software in connection with our platform, which may pose risks to our intellectual property.\nWe use open source software in connection with our platform and plan to continue using open-source software in the future. Some licenses governing the use of open-source software contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open-source software. If we combine or link our proprietary source code with open-source software in certain ways, we may be required, under the terms of the applicable open-source licenses, to make our proprietary source code available to third parties. Although we monitor our use of open-source software, we cannot provide assurance that all open-source software is reviewed prior to use in our platform, that our developers have not incorporated open-source software into our platform that we are unaware of, or that they will not do so in the future. Additionally, the terms of open-source licenses have not been extensively interpreted by United States or international courts, and so there is a risk that open-source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on us or our proprietary software. If an author or other third party that distributes such open-source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of an open-source license, we could incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations or remediating any alleged non-compliance with open-source licenses. Any such remediation efforts could require significant additional resources, and we may not be able to successfully complete any such remediation. Further, in addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain\nopen-source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties, and the open-source software may contain security vulnerabilities.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure, we may be unable to offer our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nIn order to operate our existing and proposed flight schedule and, where desirable, add service along new or existing routes, we must be able to maintain or obtain space for passenger terminals. As airports and heliports around the world become more congested, it may not be possible for us to ensure that our plans for new service can be implemented in a commercially viable manner, given operating constraints at airports and heliports throughout our network, including those imposed by inadequate facilities at desirable locations. Additionally, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary approvals and to make necessary infrastructure changes to enable adoption of EVA, including installation of necessary charging equipment. Any limitation on our ability to acquire or maintain space for passenger terminal operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nBlade leases and licenses exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure from airport and heliport operators in key markets. These leases, licenses, and permits vary in term, ranging from month-to-month permits to multi-year use and occupancy agreements that are coterminous with the airport or heliport operator\u2019s underlying lease with the municipality that owns the premises. While our experience with these multi-year use and occupancy agreements have led to long-term uninterrupted usage thus far, certain municipalities, including New York, retain the authority to terminate a heliport operator\u2019s lease upon as short as 30 days\u2019 notice. If a municipality exercised its termination rights, under certain conditions, our agreements with the airport or heliport operator would concurrently terminate. Termination of one or more of our leases could negatively impact our ability to provide services in our existing markets and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may require substantial additional funding to finance our operations, but adequate additional financing may not be available when we need it, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nPrior to our recapitalization we financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through private financing rounds. In the future, we could be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. For example, the global COVID-19 health crisis and related financial impact has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption and volatility of global financial markets that could adversely impact our ability to access capital. We may sell equity securities or debt securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, our current investors may be materially diluted. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our operational flexibility or profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nAny future international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks, and our plans may not be successful.\nWe have started expanding our presence internationally. In 2019, we entered into a joint venture in India (our \u201cIndian Joint Venture\u201d) and we may continue to expand our international operations. Operating outside of the United States may require significant management attention to oversee operations across a broad geographic area with varying regulations, customs and cultural norms, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;\n\u2022competition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more effectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\n\u2022differing demand dynamics, which may make our offerings less successful;\n\u2022complying with local laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to data privacy and tax;\n\u2022obtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\n\u2022varying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\n\u2022costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022operating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States; and\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nWe hold a minority ownership stake in our Indian Joint Venture and do not hold any control rights over the operations of the business. As such, we cannot directly prevent actions which may result in losses or negative publicity. While we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk associated with our lack of control, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all potential risks and may adversely impact our reputation and brand, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In the future, we may enter into other joint ventures or licensing agreements that involve a similar lack of control, which could adversely impact our reputation and brand.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may increase our risks related to compliance with various laws and standards, including with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and trade and economic sanctions.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business and have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nWe have and intend to continue to explore potential strategic acquisitions of assets and businesses, including partnerships or joint ventures with third parties. Our management has limited experience with acquiring and integrating acquired strategic assets and companies into our business, and there is no assurance that any future acquisitions will be successful. We may not be successful in identifying appropriate targets for such transactions. In addition, we may not be able to continue the operational success of such businesses or successfully finance or integrate any assets or businesses that we acquire or with which we form a partnership or joint venture. We may have potential write-offs of acquired assets and/or an impairment of any goodwill recorded as a result of acquisitions. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition may divert management\u2019s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations or may result in conflicts with our business. Any acquisition, partnership, or joint venture may reduce our cash reserves, may negatively affect our earnings and financial performance, and, to the extent financed with the proceeds of debt, may increase our indebtedness, and, to the extent acquired or financed through equity issuance, dilute our current investors. We cannot ensure that any acquisition, partnership, or joint venture we make will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\nIf our operations continue to grow as planned, of which there can be no assurance, we will need to expand our sales, marketing, operations, and the number of aircraft operators with whom we do business. Our continued growth could increase the strain on our resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training, and managing an increasing number of employees. These difficulties may result in the erosion of our brand image, divert the attention of management and key employees, and impact financial and operational results. In addition, in order to continue to increase our presence, we expect to incur substantial expenses as we continue to attempt to increase our route offerings, flight frequency, passenger terminal footprint, and employee base. The continued expansion of our business may also require additional space for administrative support. If we are unable to drive commensurate growth, these costs, which include lease commitments, marketing costs and headcount, could result in decreased margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur insurance may become too difficult or expensive for us to obtain. Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nThough we do not own or operate aircraft, we maintain general liability aviation premise insurance, non-owned aircraft liability coverage, and directors and officers insurance, and we believe our level of coverage is customary in the industry and adequate to protect against claims. However, there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that present levels of coverage will be available in the future at reasonable cost. Further, we expect our insurance costs to increase as we add routes, increase flight, and passenger volumes and expand into new markets. It is too early to determine what impact, if any, the adoption of EVAs will have on our insurance costs.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management team and other highly skilled personnel. If we are not successful in attracting or retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur success depends, in significant part, on the continued services of our senior management team and on our ability to attract, motivate, develop, and retain a sufficient number of other highly skilled personnel, including finance, marketing, sales, and technology and support personnel. We believe that the breadth and depth of our senior management team\u2019s experience across multiple industries will be instrumental to our success. The loss of any one or more members of our senior management team, for any reason, including resignation or retirement, could impair our ability to execute our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees to support our operations and growth.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes accountability, attention to detail, communication, and support for others, has been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:\n\u2022failure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values, and mission;\n\u2022the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\n\u2022competitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\n\u2022the continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry;\n\u2022the increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\n\u2022negative perception of our treatment of employees or our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; and\n\u2022the integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\nIf we are not able to maintain our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third-Party Providers\nWe rely on our third-party operators to provide and operate aircraft to move our fliers. If such third-party operators do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur asset-light business model means that we do not own or operate any aircraft. Instead, we rely on third-party contractors to own and operate aircraft. Pilots, maintenance, hangar, insurance, and fuel are all costs borne by our network of operators. Should we experience complications with any of these third-party contractors or their aircraft, we may need to delay or cancel flights. We face the risk that any of our contractors may not fulfill their contracts and deliver their services\non a timely basis, or at all. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, operational complications with our contractors. The ability of our contractors to effectively satisfy our requirements could also be impacted by any such contractor\u2019s financial difficulty or damage to their operations caused by fire, terrorist attack, natural disaster, pandemic, such as the current COVID-19 outbreak, or other events. The failure of any contractors to perform to our expectations could result in delayed or cancelled flights and harm our business. Our reliance on contractors and our inability to fully control any operational difficulties with our third-party contractors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our third-party aircraft operators are unable to match our growth in demand or we are unable to add additional third-party aircraft operators to our platform to meet demand, our costs may increase and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a finite number of certificated third-party aircraft operators to provide our services. In the event potential competitors establish cooperative or strategic relationships with third-party aircraft operators in the markets we serve, offer to pay third-party aircraft operators more attractive rates or guarantee a higher volume of flights than we offer, we may not have access to the necessary number of aircraft to achieve our planned growth. Though we have successfully incentivized our operators to add aircraft to support our growth in the past, there is no guarantee we will be able to continue doing so without incurring costs. Increased use of private aircraft since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has added competitive pressure for access to aircraft, which may make it more difficult or costly for third-party operators to expand to meet our needs. If our third-party aircraft operators are unable or unwilling to add aircraft, or are only able to do so at significantly increased expense, or otherwise do not have capacity or desire to support our growth, or we are unable to add new operators on reasonable terms, or at all, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. As the urban air mobility market grows, we expect competition for third-party aircraft operators to increase. Further, we expect that as competition in the urban air mobility market grows, the use of exclusive contractual arrangements with third-party aircraft operators, sometimes requiring volume guarantees, may increase, as may the cost of securing their services.\nTransportation for the hearts, lungs and livers that make up the vast majority of our MediMobility business is typically requested only hours before the required departure time. Our ability to successfully fulfill these requests is the primary metric by which MediMobility customers evaluate our performance. The short turnaround times required in our MediMobility business necessitate dedicated aircraft and crews. Historically, the combination of Blade's retail and MediMobility demand has been enough to incentivize operators to provide dedicated aircraft and crews for this purpose, but there is no guarantee that will continue, particularly if demand for private aircraft continues to increase.\nIf we encounter problems with any of our third-party aircraft operators or third-party service providers, such as workforce disruptions, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.\nAll of our flight operations are conducted by third-party aircraft operators on our behalf. Due to our reliance on third parties to provide these essential services, we are subject to the risk of disruptions to their operations, which has in the past and may in the future result from many of the same risk factors disclosed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as the impact of adverse economic conditions and the inability of third parties to hire or retain skilled personnel, including pilots and mechanics. Several of these third-party operators provide significant capacity that we would be unable to replace in a short period of time should that operator fail to perform its obligations to us. Disruptions to capital markets, shortages of skilled personnel and adverse economic conditions in general, such as conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, have subjected certain of these third-party regional operators to significant financial and operational pressures, which have in the past and could result in the temporary or permanent cessation of their operations. We may also experience disruption to our regional operations if we terminate agreements with one or more of our current aircraft operators and transition the services to another provider. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we did not renew agreements with some of the third-party aircraft operators who have provided flight services to us in the past. While we continue to do business with some of these operators despite the lack of an agreement, there is no assurance that we will continue to do so. Additionally, although we expect to enter into new agreements with such operators on acceptable terms in the future, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so.\nAlthough our third-party aircraft operators are not currently experiencing workforce disruptions, we cannot predict the future actions of their workforce. Union strikes among airport workers or certain pilots of third-party aircraft operators may result in disruptions of our urban air mobility service and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any significant disruption to our operations as a result of problems with any\nof our third-party aircraft operators would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, we have entered into agreements with contractors to provide various facilities and services required for our operations. Because we rely on others to provide such services, our ability to control the efficiency and timeliness of such services is limited. Similar agreements may be entered into in any new markets we decide to serve. We are also at risk should one of these service providers cease operations, and there is no guarantee that we could replace these providers on a timely basis with comparably priced providers, or at all. Any material problems with the efficiency and timeliness of contract services, resulting from financial hardships or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur third-party aircraft operators\u2019 insurance may become too difficult or expensive for them to obtain. If our third-party aircraft operators are unable to maintain sufficient insurance coverage, it may materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nHazards are inherent in the aviation industry and may result in loss of life and property, potentially exposing us to substantial liability claims arising from the operation of aircraft. Safe operation of aircraft is primarily the responsibility of our third-party operators and they are primarily held liable for accidents, thus incidents related to aircraft operation are covered by our third-party operators\u2019 insurance. A limited number of hull and liability insurance underwriters provide coverage for our third-party aircraft operators. Insurance underwriters are required by various federal and state regulations to maintain minimum levels of reserves for known and expected claims. However, there can be no assurance that underwriters have established adequate reserves to fund existing and future claims. The number of air medical or tourism accidents, as well as the number of insured losses within other helicopter operations and the commercial airline industry, and the impact of general economic conditions on underwriters may result in increases in premiums above the rate of inflation. If our third-party aircraft operators\u2019 insurance costs increase, such operators are likely to pass the increased costs to us, which could cause us to increase the prices paid by our fliers. Such cost increases could adversely affect demand for our services and harm our business. Additionally, under all aircraft operating agreements, our third-party aircraft operators have agreed to indemnify us against liability arising from the operation of aircraft and to maintain insurance covering such liability. However, there can be no assurance there will be no challenge to the indemnification rights or that the aircraft operator will have sufficient assets or insurance coverage to fulfill its indemnity obligations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate operation of branded aircraft by our third-party aircraft operators, regardless of whether they are operating aircraft on our behalf, could harm our reputation, business, brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSome of our third-party aircraft operators operate Blade-branded aircraft on a non-exclusive basis, enabling them to utilize Blade-branded aircraft for flight operations unrelated to Blade. If our third-party aircraft operators were to operate Blade-branded aircraft, regardless of whether such aircraft is flying on our behalf, in an illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate manner, such as violating local noise-abatement regulations or ignoring suggested noise-abatement flight paths and procedures, we could be exposed to significant reputational harm. While we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of activities, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity by our third-party aircraft operators while flying Blade-branded aircraft. Further, any negative publicity related to the foregoing, whether or not such incident occurred while flying on our behalf, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of the urban air mobility industry as a whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours and potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party web service providers to deliver our offerings to users on our platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of third-party web services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur platform\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We currently host our platform and support our operations using a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. While we have engaged reputable vendors to provide these services, we do not have control over the operations of the facilities used by our third-party provider, and their facilities may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, human error, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of misconduct. In addition, any changes in our third-party cloud infrastructure provider\u2019s service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users. While we believe we have implemented reasonable backup and disaster recovery plans, we have experienced, and expect\nthat in the future we will experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand our service offerings. Any negative publicity or user dissatisfaction arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our offerings, and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nOur business is subject to a wide variety of extensive and evolving laws and regulations, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations relating to various aspects of our business, employment and labor, health care, tax, privacy and data security, health and safety, and environmental issues. Laws and regulations at the foreign, federal, state, and local levels frequently change, especially in relation to new and emerging industries, and we cannot always reasonably predict the impact from, or the ultimate cost of compliance with, current or future legal or regulatory changes. We monitor these developments and devote a significant amount of management\u2019s time and external resources towards compliance. Moreover, changes in law, the imposition of new or additional regulations or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts our business could require us to change the way we operate or limit our ability to expand into certain jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFurther, our business has been adversely impacted when government agencies have ceased to operate as expected including due to partial shut-downs or similar events. These events have resulted in, among other things, reduced demand for air travel, an actual or perceived reduction in air traffic control and security screening resources, and related travel delays, as well as disruption in the ability of the FAA to grant required regulatory approvals, such as those that are involved when a new aircraft is first placed into service.\nUnited States. Our operations are highly regulated by several U.S. government regulatory agencies, including the DOT and the FAA. These requirements restrict the ways we may conduct our business, as well as the operations of our third-party aircraft operators. Failure to comply with such requirements in the future may result in fines and other enforcement actions by the regulators. In the future, any new regulatory requirements, particularly requirements that limit our third-party aircraft operators\u2019 ability to operate, could have a material adverse effect on us and the industry. Further, DOT and FAA rules require certain disclosures to consumers and filing of routes, which could create a burden on our marketing and operations teams.\nOur results of operations and the manner in which we conduct business may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies, including:\n\u2022changes in law that affect the services that can be offered by us in particular markets and at particular airports, or the types of fares offered or fees that can be charged to fliers;\n\u2022restrictions on competitive practices (for example, court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would curtail our ability to respond to a competitor);\n\u2022the adoption of new passenger security standards or regulations that impact customer service standards;\n\u2022restrictions on airport operations, such as restrictions on the use of airports or heliports; and\n\u2022the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions.\nEach additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to operations and, in some cases, may reduce the demand for air travel. There can be no assurance that the increased costs or greater complexity associated with our compliance with new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nAny significant reduction in air traffic capacity at and in the airspace serving key airports in the United States or overseas could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Weaknesses in the National Airspace System and the Air Traffic Control (\u201cATC\u201d) system, such as outdated procedures and technologies, have resulted in short-term capacity constraints during peak travel periods or adverse weather conditions in certain markets, resulting in delays and disruptions of air traffic. Outdated technologies may also cause the ATC system to be less resilient in the event of a failure. For example, an automation failure and an evacuation, in 2015 and 2017 respectively, at the Washington Air Route Control Center resulted in cancellations and delays of hundreds of flights traversing the greater Washington, D.C. airspace.\nIndia. The Indian Joint Venture\u2019s operations are highly regulated by Indian government agencies, including the Airports Authority of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and Directorate General of Civil Aviation. If the Indian Joint Venture\u2019s operations fail to comply with these laws and regulations, or if these agencies develop concerns over our operations, the Indian Joint Venture could face administrative, civil, and/or criminal penalties. In addition, we may become subject to regulatory actions that could suspend, curtail, or significantly modify the Indian Joint Venture\u2019s operations, which could adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Indian Joint Venture.\nFailure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, such as obtaining and maintaining licenses, certificates, authorizations, and permits critical for the operation of our business, may result in civil penalties or private lawsuits, or the suspension or revocation of licenses, certificates, authorizations, or permits, which would prevent us from operating our business. Even when we believe we are in complete compliance, a regulatory agency may determine that we are not.\nWe may be blocked from or limited in providing or offering our services in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nWe face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for in local government, which could prevent us from operating our urban air mobility services. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in accordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or third-party aircraft operators are required to comply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to urban air mobility services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.\nWe currently operate passenger terminals out of several airports and heliports throughout New York, Massachusetts, and Florida. These facilities are strategically located in close proximity to heavily populated areas. If these airports or heliports were to restrict access for rotor wing operations, our passenger volume and utilization rates may be significantly adversely impacted and certain existing or planned future routes may cease to be profitable for us to operate. New York has a limited number of hangar and helipad sites, which may limit our ability to expand operations to other locations within the state. While we do not require hangar space to operate our business, the availability of nearby hangar space is advantageous to allow our third-party aircraft operators to effectively support our business. In addition, communities near certain key heliports and airports, and the elected officials representing them, are concerned about noise generated by helicopters. Some of these communities have proposed new rules and legislation to reduce or eliminate helicopter flights from key Blade service areas, including Manhattan. (For example, proposed federal legislation in 2019 sought to limit helicopter flights over any city with certain population and density restrictions, though the bill did not pass. Additionally, the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton, New York is considering the temporary closure, or additional restrictions on the use, of the East Hampton Airport, following the expiration of FAA grant assurances in September of 2021. If any similar efforts are successful, our business would be severely impacted and our growth opportunities in such areas may be reduced.)\nFailure to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and consumer protection, or the expansion of current laws and regulations or the enactment of new laws or regulations in these areas, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions related to privacy, data protection, and consumer protection that are often complex and subject to varying interpretations. As a result, these privacy, data protection, and consumer protection laws may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies and such changes or developments may be contrary to our existing practices. This may cause us to expend resources on updating, changing, or eliminating some of our privacy and data protection practices.\nWe receive, collect, store, process, transmit, share, and use personal information, and other customer data, including health information, and we rely in part on third parties that are not directly under our control to manage certain of these operations\nand to receive, collect, store, process, transmit, share, and use such personal information, including payment information. A variety of federal, state, local, municipal, and foreign laws and regulations, as well as industry standards (such as the payment card industry standards) govern the collection, storage, processing, sharing, use, retention, and security of this information, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, the Telephone Protection and Electronic Protection Act of 1991 (\u201cTCPA\u201d), Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). Laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may not be harmonized, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a result, our practices may not have complied or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements, and obligations. The failure to comply with such data protection and privacy regulations can result in fines, penalties, and the enforcement of any non-compliance, which could significantly impact our business operations.\nIn January 2020, CCPA took effect, which provides new data privacy rights for consumers in California and new operational requirements for companies doing business in California. Compliance with the new obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them, and because the CCPA is relatively new, there is still some uncertainty about how the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. If we fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the CCPA, we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties (up to $2,500 per violation, or up to $7,500 per violation if the violation is intentional) and litigation, any of which may negatively impact our reputation, require us to expend significant resources, and harm our business. Furthermore, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) on November 3, 2020, which will amend and expand the CCPA, including by providing consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information. The CPRA will come into effect on January 1, 2023, applying to information collected by businesses on or after January 1, 2022. We believe that the personal information we collect from California residents that use our app, the air transportation services we have offered in California in the past, and direct marketing to California residents for those services, as well as our plans to offer future services in California, have made and in the future will make Blade subject to compliance with CCPA and CPRA.\nMoreover, as we expand our international presence, we will also be subject to additional privacy rules of such foreign jurisdictions, many of which, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) and national laws supplementing the GDPR or national laws of similar scope and nature, such as in the United Kingdom, may require significant resources to comply with. The GDPR, for example, requires companies to meet stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data and highly sensitive personal data of individuals located in the European Economic Area and includes significant monetary penalties for noncompliance. We do not currently offer or advertise our services in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), and all of our services are charged in U.S. dollars. In the past we have marketed air transportation service for a significant event held in the EU, and we have arranged charter services for clients. These activities, and similar activities we may engage in in the future, could require us to comply with the GDPR.\nWe have in the past, and could be in the future, subject to data breaches. A significant data breach or any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any federal, state, or foreign privacy laws, regulations, or other principles or orders to which we may be subject could adversely affect our reputation, brand, and business, and may result in claims, investigations, proceedings, or actions against us by governmental entities, litigation, including class action litigation, from our fliers, fines, penalties, or other liabilities, or require us to change our operations or cease using certain data sets. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify users, law enforcement, government authorities, payment companies, consumer reporting agencies, or the media about the incident and may be required to expend additional resources in connection with investigating and remediating such an incident, and otherwise complying with applicable privacy and data security laws.\nEnvironmental regulation and liabilities, including new or developing laws and regulations, may increase our costs of operations and adversely affect us.\nIn recent years, governments have increasingly focused on climate change, carbon emissions, and energy use. Laws and regulations that curb the use of conventional energy or require the use of renewable fuels or renewable sources of energy, such as wind or solar power, could result in a reduction in demand for hydrocarbon-based fuels such as oil and natural gas. In addition, governments could pass laws, regulations or taxes that increase the cost of such fuels, thereby decreasing demand for our services and also increasing the costs of our operations by our third-party aircraft operators. More stringent environmental laws, regulations, or enforcement policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities and Being a Public Company\nBlade has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If Blade\u2019s remediation of these material weaknesses is not effective, or if Blade experiences additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fails to maintain effective internal controls in the future, Blade may not be able to accurately or timely report its financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in Blade and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management is likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses identified through such evaluation of those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn connection with the audit of Blade\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2021, management concluded that the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2021, due to the existence of a material weakness. The Company has not developed a formal framework that enables management to assess the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, specifically lacking evidential matter to support:\n\u2022Management\u2019s evaluation of whether the internal controls are designed to prevent or detect material misstatements or omissions;\n\u2022Management\u2019s conclusion that controls tests were appropriately planned and performed to adequately assess the operating effectiveness of the controls; and\n\u2022That the results of the control tests were appropriately considered.\nThis material weakness could lead to difficultly in monitoring the effectiveness of our internal controls. While we have hired a Director of Internal Controls to assist in the overall evaluation and documentation of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls and expect to have them remediated during 2022, the work is ongoing, may be time consuming and costly, and there can be no assurance as to when we will successfully remediate these material weaknesses.\nIn addition, in connection with the audits of Old Blade\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2020, we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which were successfully remediated as of September 30, 2021. These weaknesses related to the lack of segregation of duties in our accounting procedures and approval of significant transactions and lack of adequate documentation of the components of our internal control processes. We remediated such material weaknesses by hiring additional finance and accounting personnel and taking certain other steps described under \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures-Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weaknesses\u201d in this Annual Report. Furthermore, prior to our business combination with EIC, EIC identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for a significant and unusual transaction related to the warrants EIC issued in connection with the EIC IPO in September 2019. After discussion with EIC\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm following the issuance of the SEC Staff Statement on April 12, 2021, EIC\u2019s management and audit committee concluded that, in light of the SEC Staff Statement, it was appropriate to restate our previously issued and audited financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020. As a result of this material weakness, EIC management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020. This material weakness resulted in a material misstatement of EIC\u2019s warrant liabilities, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, additional paid-in capital, accumulated deficit, and related financial disclosures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs discussed above, we have taken a number of measures to remediate these material weaknesses; however, if we are unable to remediate our continuing material weaknesses in a timely manner or we identify additional material weaknesses, we may be unable to provide required financial information in a timely and reliable manner and we may incorrectly report financial information. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to timely file will cause us to be ineligible to utilize short form registration statements on Form S-3 or Form S-4, which may impair our ability to obtain capital in a timely fashion to execute our business strategies or issue shares to effect an acquisition. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. The existence of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our reputation or\ninvestor perceptions of us, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. In addition, we have and will continue to incur additional costs to remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nIf our management is unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if Blade\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, when required, lenders and investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and we may face restricted access to various sources of financing in the future.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq. The requirements of these rules and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, have made some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly and have placed significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In particular, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d) requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm potentially to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may be unable to provide financial information and required SEC reports that a U.S. publicly traded company is required to provide in a timely and reliable fashion. Any such delays or deficiencies could penalize us, including by limiting our ability to obtain financing, either in the public capital markets or from private sources and hurt our reputation and could thereby impede our ability to implement our growth strategy. In addition, any such delays or deficiencies could result in our failure to meet the requirements for listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq.\nWe are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In order to develop, maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related and audit-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value for each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe are accounting for both the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants as a warrant liability. At each reporting period, the accounting treatment of the Warrants will be re-evaluated for proper accounting treatment as a liability or equity, and the fair value of the liability of the public and private warrants will be remeasured. The change in the fair value of the liability will be recorded as other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations. The value of the liability related to the Warrants is determined by the warrants' market price, which is driven mainly by the share price of our common stock. Changes in the warrants' market price may have a material impact on the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative liability. As a result, our consolidated financial statements and results of operations will fluctuate quarterly, based on the share price of our common stock. If our stock price is volatile, we expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on our Warrants or any other similar derivative instruments each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses could be material. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. See Note 3, 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s securities may change significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nThe trading price of our common stock and Warrants has been and in the future may again be volatile. The stock market experienced extreme volatility during part of 2020 and 2021. This volatility often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. An investor might not be able to resell shares or Warrants at an attractive price due to a number of factors such as those listed in \u201c Risks Related to Our Business and Growth Strategy\u201d. Broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of the Company\u2019s actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If the Company was involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from the Company\u2019s business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nThere is no guarantee that the Warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless.\nThe exercise price for our Warrants is $11.50 per share. There can be no assurance that the Warrants will be in the money prior to their expiration and, as such, they may expire worthless. The terms of our Warrants may be amended in a manner that may be adverse to the holders. The Warrant Agreement between American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC, as warrant agent, and us provides that the terms of the Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding Warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the Warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding Warrants approve of such amendment. Our ability to amend the terms of the Warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding Warrants is unlimited. Examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the Warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our common stock purchasable upon exercise of a Warrant.\nWe may redeem unexpired Warrants held by former EIC stockholders prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to those stockholders, thereby making such Warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding Warrants at any time prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per Warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of our common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the Warrant holders. If and when the Warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding Warrants could force you to: (1) exercise your Warrants and pay the related exercise price at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so; (2) sell your Warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your Warrants; or (3) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your Warrants. None of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us for cash so long as they are held by the Sponsor (Experience Sponsor LLC) or its permitted transferees.\nIn addition, we may redeem Warrants (including Private Placement Warrants) for a number of shares of our common stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our common stock. Any such redemption may have similar consequences to a cash redemption described above. In addition, such redemption may occur at a time when the Warrants are \u201cout-of-the-money\u201d, in which case you would lose any potential embedded value from a subsequent increase in the value of our common stock had your Warrants remained outstanding.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe Company intends to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations and expansion and there are no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount, and payment of any future dividends on shares of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (or \u201cBoard\u201d). The Company\u2019s Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, the Company\u2019s available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions, implications on the payment of dividends by the Company to its stockholders or by\nits subsidiaries to it, and such other factors as the Company\u2019s Board of Directors may deem relevant. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock unless you sell the Company\u2019s common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nA market for our securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities may not be sustained.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities without your approval, which would dilute your ownership interest in us and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions, repayment of outstanding indebtedness or grants under our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan without stockholder approval in a number of circumstances. Our issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities could have one or more of the following effects:\n\u2022our existing stockholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n\u2022the amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease;\n\u2022the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share of common stock may be diminished; and\n\u2022the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe incur significant costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\nAs a privately held company, Old Blade was not required to comply with many corporate governance and financial reporting practices and policies required of a publicly traded company. As a publicly traded company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we were not required to incur in the past. These expenses will increase once we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). In addition, new and changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure for public companies, including Dodd Frank, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and regulations related thereto and the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, have increased the costs and the time that must be devoted to compliance matters. These rules and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our legal and financial costs and divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d We may remain an \u201cemerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following September 13, 2024 or such earlier time that we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. To the extent we choose not to use exemptions from various reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, or if we no longer can be classified as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we expect that we will incur additional compliance costs, which will reduce our ability to operate profitably.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d or \u201csmaller reporting companies,\u201d this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth\ncompany for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of any second quarter of a fiscal year, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the last day of such fiscal year. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a registration statement under the Securities Act declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to \u201cnon-emerging growth companies\u201d but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company that is not an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nAdditionally, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is greater than or equal to $250 million as of the end of that fiscal year\u2019s second fiscal quarter, and (ii) our annual revenues are greater than or equal to $100 million during the last completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year\u2019s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\nIf we do not develop and implement all required accounting practices and policies, we may be unable to provide the financial information required of a U.S. publicly traded company in a timely and reliable manner.\nAs Old Blade was a privately held company, it was not required to adopt all of the financial reporting and disclosure procedures and controls required of a U.S. publicly traded company. The implementation of all required accounting practices and policies and the hiring of additional financial staff has increased and may continue to increase our operating costs and requires our management to devote significant time and resources to such implementation. If we fail to develop and maintain effective internal controls and procedures and disclosure procedures and controls, we may be unable to provide financial information and required SEC reports that are timely and reliable. Any such delays or deficiencies could harm us, including by limiting our ability to obtain financing, either in the public capital markets or from private sources and damaging our reputation, which in either cause could impede our ability to implement our growth strategy. In addition, any such delays or deficiencies could result in our failure to meet the requirements for continued listing of our common stock on Nasdaq.\nProvisions in our charter and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those you desire.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings and the federal district courts as the sole and exclusive forum for other types of actions and proceedings, in each case, that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain what such stockholders believe to be a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or our directors, officers, or other employees.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or any other wrongdoing by, any current or former director, officer, or other employee or stockholder of the Company; (iii) action asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or (iv) action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of any provisions in the certificate of incorporation of bylaws; or (v) action asserting a claim against the company or any director or officer of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware. Subject to the foregoing, the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for the resolution of any action, suit, or proceeding asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act. The exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring an interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our certificate of incorporation. These choice-of-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that he, she, or it believes to be favorable for disputes with the Company or our directors, officers, or other employees or stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits. We note that there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce these provisions and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAlternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and Board of Directors.\nStockholders may experience dilution in the future.\nThe percentage of shares of our common stock owned by current stockholders may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions, or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers, and employees or exercise of the Warrants. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not maintain coverage of us, if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our common stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our businesses. If securities or industry analysts do not maintain coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our securities or publish unfavorable research about our businesses, or if our operating results do not meet analyst expectations, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for the common stock to decline.\nThe sale of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nPursuant to an Investor Rights Agreement, certain stockholders have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of common stock under the Securities Act. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares, these stockholders could cause the prevailing market price of our common stock to decline.\nIf these stockholders exercise their registration rights, the trading price of shares of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of common stock or other securities.\nIn addition, the shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to any applicable vesting requirements, lockup agreements and other restrictions imposed by law. A total number of shares representing 10% of the fully diluted shares of common stock immediately following consummation of the merger have been reserved for future issuance under our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The compensation committee of our Board of Directors may determine the exact number of shares to be reserved for future issuance under our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan at its discretion.", "PERMNO": 19071, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "EXPC"}
