Risk Factors.\nYou should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks described below have been organized under headings that are provided for convenience and intended to organize the risks and uncertainties into related categories to improve readability for investors; no inference should be drawn, however, that the placement of a risk factor under a particular category means that it is not applicable to another category of risks or that it may be more or less material than another risk factor. Regardless, they are also not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties, as discussed above in this Part I under the caption \u201cDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including the risk factors and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe cost of healthcare is funded substantially by government and private insurance programs, and if such funding is reduced or limited or no longer available, our business may be adversely impacted.\nThird-party payors, including Medicaid, Medicare and private health insurance providers, provide substantial funding for our services. Other payors, including MCOs, are also dependent upon Medicaid funding. These payors are increasingly seeking to reduce the cost of healthcare, which drives pressure on the reimbursement rates for healthcare services, including our services. We cannot assure you that our services will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that reimbursement will continue to be available or that payor reimbursement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our services on a profitable basis, if at all. We cannot control reimbursement rates, including Medicare market basket or other rate adjustments. Reimbursement for services that we provide is primarily through Medicaid and MCOs and rates can vary state by state and payor by payor. There are currently various legislative efforts under way to increase minimum wages in markets in which we operate, and that could impact significantly the wage rates for personal care attendants we utilize to provide our personal care services. Payors may be unable or unwilling to increase reimbursement rates sufficiently to offset the impact on us or, in cases where payors do increase reimbursement rates, such increases may not occur concurrently with the increase in wage rates. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe implementation of alternative payment models and the transition of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries to MCOs may limit our market share and could adversely affect our revenues.\nMany government and commercial payors are transitioning providers to alternative payment models that are designed to promote cost-efficiency, quality and coordination of care. For example, accountable care organizations, or ACOs, seek to motivate hospitals, physician groups, and other providers to organize and coordinate patient care while reducing unnecessary costs. Several states have implemented, or have announced that they plan to implement, accountable care models for their Medicaid populations. If we are not included in these programs, or if ACOs establish programs that overlap with the services provided by us, we are at risk for losing market share and of experiencing a loss of business.\nWe may be similarly impacted by increased enrollment of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care plans, shifting away from traditional fee-for-service models. Under the Medicare managed care program, also known as Medicare Advantage or MA, the federal government contracts with private health insurers to provide Medicare benefits. Insurers may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher plan costs on beneficiaries. Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans is also growing, as states are increasingly relying on MCOs to deliver Medicaid program services as a strategy to control costs and manage resources. We may experience increased competition for managed care contracts due to state regulation and limitations. For instance, in October 2018, New York began imposing limits on the number of home healthcare providers with which a managed Medicaid plan can contract. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to be included in plan networks, that we will be able to secure favorable contracts with all or some of the MCOs, that our reimbursement under these programs will remain at current levels, that the authorizations for services will remain at current levels or that our profitability will remain at levels consistent with past performance, and if we are not successful in these areas our business could be materially harmed and our financial condition materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, operational processes may not be well defined as a state transitions beneficiaries to managed care. For example, membership, new referrals and the related authorization for services to be provided may be delayed, which may result\nin delays in service delivery to consumers or in payment for services rendered. Difficulties with operational processes may negatively affect our revenue growth rates, cash flow and profitability for services provided. Other alternative payment models, such as value-based billing, capitated rates and per member per month pricing, may be required by the government, MCOs and other commercial payors to control their costs while shifting financial risk to us, which could also materially affect our operations and business condition.\nWe are limited in our ability to control reimbursement rates received for our services, and if we are not able to maintain or reduce our costs to provide such services, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nMedicare and Medicaid are among our most significant payors, and their rates are established through federal and state statutes and regulations. As a result, we have to manage our costs of providing care to achieve a desired level of profitability. Additionally, reimbursement rates with MCOs and other payors are difficult for us to negotiate as such payors are themselves limited in their ability to control rates and funding received from Medicaid and Medicare and are under pressure to reduce their own costs. We therefore manage our costs in order to achieve a desired level of profitability, including centralizing various back office processes, using technology and practicing efficient management of our workforce. If we are not able to continue to streamline our processes and reduce our costs, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFuture cost containment initiatives undertaken by private third-party payors may limit our future revenue and profitability.\nOur commercial payor and managed Medicaid revenue and profitability are affected by continuing efforts of third-party payors to maintain or reduce costs of healthcare by lowering payment rates, narrowing the scope and utilization of covered services, increasing case management review of services and negotiating pricing. There can be no assurance that third-party payors will make timely payments for our services, and there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain our current payor or revenue mix. We will continue our efforts to develop our commercial payor and managed Medicaid sources of revenue and any changes in payment levels from current or future third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be more vulnerable to the effects of a public health emergency than other businesses due to the nature of our end-users and the physical proximity required by our operations, which could harm our business disproportionally to other businesses.\nThe majority of our end-users are older individuals with complex medical challenges, many of whom may be more vulnerable than the general public during a pandemic or in a public health emergency. Our employees are also at greater risk of contracting contagious diseases due to their increased exposure to vulnerable end-users. Our employees could also have difficulty attending to our end-users if a program of social distancing or quarantine is instituted in response to a public health emergency, or if \u201cstay at home\u201d orders are perpetuated or reinitiated. In addition, we may expand existing internal policies in a manner that may have a similar effect. If the COVID-19 virus sustains, or if there is an additional resurgence of infections of COVID-19 or its potentially more contagious variants, or if an influenza or other pandemic were to occur, we could suffer significant losses to our consumer population or a willingness by our end-users to utilize our services, in particular in our Personal Care Segment, or a reduction in the availability of our employees and, at a high cost, we could be required to hire replacements for affected workers. Accordingly, public health emergencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, our information technology systems, including the systems intended to protect our clients\u2019 privacy and confidential information, which could lead to legal liability, adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur information technology, or IT, systems are critically important to our operations and we must implement and maintain appropriate and sufficient infrastructure and IT systems to support growth and our existing business processes. We provide services to individuals and others that require us to collect, process, maintain and retain sensitive and personal client confidential information in our computer systems, including patient identifiable health information, financial information and other personal information about our end-users, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, identification numbers and payment account information. As a result, we are subject to complex and evolving United States privacy laws and regulations, including those pertaining to the handling of personal data, such as HIPAA, CCPA, and others. Most states have enacted laws, which vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. An increasing number of states require that impacted individuals and regulatory authorities be notified if a\nsecurity breach results in the unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, personal information. Notifications are also required under HIPAA to the extent there is unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, personal health information. California residents and households in particular are afforded significantly expanded privacy protections under the CCPA. The enacted laws often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Further, while we are using internal and external resources to monitor compliance with and to continue to modify our data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws, relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws, which could subject us to penalties and/or litigation. In addition, there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper disclosure of personal data. Improper disclosure of personal data in violation of the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could adversely affect our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe also rely on our IT systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage the data, communications and business processes for other business functions, including our marketing, sales, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. Furthermore, our systems include interfaces to third-party stakeholders, often connected via the internet. In addition, some of our services or information related to our services are carried out or hosted within our customers\u2019 IT systems, and any failure or weaknesses in their IT systems may negatively impact our ability to deliver the services, for which we may not receive relief from contractual performance obligations or compensation for services provided. In addition, security incidents impacting other companies, such as our vendors, may allow cybercriminals to obtain personal information about our customers and employees. Cybercriminals may then use this information to, among other things, attempt to gain unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 accounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. As a result of the data we maintain and third-party access, we are subject to increasing cybersecurity risks associated with malicious cyber-attacks intended to gain access to protected personal information. The nature of our business, where services are often performed outside of locations where network security can be assured, adds additional risk. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted.\nFurthermore, computer hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks, and our information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, employee or other confidential data), cyber-attacks or other material system failures arising out of malware or ransomware attacks, denial of services, or other attacks or security incidents, any of which could adversely impact our operations and financial results, our relationships with business partners and customers, and our reputation. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures sufficient to prevent a breach of our systems and protect sensitive data, including confidential personal information. Any breach of our data security could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. A failure to prevent, detect and respond in a timely manner to a major breach of our data security or to other cybersecurity threats could result in system disruption, business continuity issues or compromised data integrity. These events or any other failure to safeguard personal data could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. We may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach. If we are unable to prevent material failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other negative consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs, a requirement not to operate our business until defects are remedied, or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations, any of which could detrimentally affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of payors, and any changes in the funding, financial viability or our relationships with these payors could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generate a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of payors under a relatively small number of contracts. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 31.1% of our NEMT Segment revenue was derived from only five payors, and one of which, a single state Medicaid agency, contributed 9.5% to our aggregate NEMT Segment revenue during that period. The loss of, reduction in amounts generated by, or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services under these contracts could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations. In addition, any consolidation of any of our private payors could increase the impact that any such risks would have on our revenue, financial position, and results of operations.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by pandemic infectious diseases, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis that results in economic disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. COVID-19 and its potentially more contagious variants specifically, as well as measures taken by governmental authorities and private actors to limit the spread of the virus, have interfered with, and may continue to interfere with, the ability of our employees, suppliers, transportation providers and other business providers to carry out their assigned tasks at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business, which may cause us to materially curtail portions of our business operations. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on a number of evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including:\n\u2022the duration and scope of the pandemic;\n\u2022governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic;\n\u2022the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response;\n\u2022the effect on our customers and members and customer and member demand for our services, in particular with respect to our Personal Care Segment services;\n\u2022our ability to provide our services as a result of, among other things, travel restrictions, disruptions in our contact centers related to COVID-19, people working from home and taking the opportunity to provide personal care services that we might otherwise provide through our Personal Care Segment, and the willingness of our employees to return to work due to health concerns, childcare issues or enhanced unemployment benefits, including after \u201cshelter in place\u201d and other related \u201cstay at home restrictions\u201d are lifted or modified;\n\u2022issues with respect to our employees\u2019 health, working hours and/or ability to perform their duties;\n\u2022increased costs to us in response to these changing conditions and to protect the health and safety of our employees, including increased spending for hazard pay and personal protective equipment; and\n\u2022the ability of our payors to pay for our services.\nFurthermore, any failure to appropriately respond, or the perception of an inadequate response, could cause reputational harm and/or subject us to claims and litigation, either of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSince March 2020, we have observed a material reduction in trip volume in our NEMT Segment as a result of state imposed \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, many of which reduced medical services to life-sustaining programs only (for example, dialysis and chemotherapy). This reduction in trip volume has had a negative financial impact on our transportation providers and we believe that some of our transportation providers may not survive this period of reduced volume. While there has been some increase in trip volume as states have lifted or modified these restrictions and allowed businesses to reopen, we have not seen trip volumes return to pre-pandemic levels. It is currently expected that trip volumes will remain depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels as states attempt to mitigate the resurgence of the virus or to tamp down the impact of new strains of the virus that have been recently identified in the United States. If trip volumes remain depressed, we will continue to see pressure on our transportation providers and lower revenue. If, on the other hand, trip volumes increase as a result of state reopening measures, depending on the period of time over which this increase in volume occurs, we may face difficulty meeting volume demands due to the capacity constraints within our network of transportation providers. Additionally, there may be an increase in the required level of service for those utilizing NEMT services during the pandemic as a result of a sicker population or in an effort to reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19 or any of its variants. As trip volumes increase, we may face staffing difficulties in our contact centers as the recruitment of potential employees may be challenging amid health concerns and other factors related to the pandemic, which could negatively impact the customer and member experience while interfacing with our contact centers and materially adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nOur Personal Care Segment business also experienced a material reduction in historical volume of service hours and visits beginning in March 2020. While our caregivers are generally considered essential workers and not constrained by \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, volume was reduced as patients put services on hold due to infection concerns, and/or because they had the\nalternative of receiving care from family members and others working remotely or furloughed from their jobs. Cases were also lost due to patient deaths, and new case referrals slowed as referral sources faced disruption from the various restrictions and \u201cstay at home\u201d orders. Similar to our experience in the NEMT Segment, while personal care service volumes have improved since March, they have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels and may not until vaccines are more universally applied in the markets where we provide our services. If volume remains depressed, we will continue to experience lower revenue. If volume increases, depending on the period of time over which this increase in volume occurs, we may face difficulty meeting volume demands due to staffing difficulties, as the recruitment of potential employees may be challenging amid health concerns and other factors related to the pandemic. Any of these circumstances and factors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe uncertainty and volatility of NEMT trip volume and personal care services volume due to COVID-19 and its potentially more contagious variants can affect the assumptions on which we rely to develop our expense estimates relative to these business lines. If we do not accurately estimate costs incurred in providing these services, these segments may be less profitable than anticipated and our actual results may be adversely affected. Any or all of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is continuously evolving, and the continuation of the pandemic, any additional resurgence, or COVID-19 variants could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors included in this report, which in turn could further materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and profitability, including in ways that are not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks.\nOur contact center employees may be disproportionately impacted by health epidemics or pandemics like COVID-19, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur contact centers typically seat a significant number of employees in one location. Accordingly, an outbreak or resurgence of a contagious infection or virus, such as COVID-19 or its potentially more contagious variants, in one or more of the locations in which we do business may result in significant worker absenteeism, lower capacity utilization rates, voluntary or mandatory closure of our contact centers, transportation restrictions that could make it difficult for our employees to commute to work, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our business. Any prolonged or widespread health epidemic could severely disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDelays in collection, or non-collection, of our accounts receivable, particularly during any business integration process, could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nPrompt billing and collection are important factors in our liquidity. Billing and collection of our accounts receivable are subject to the complex regulations that govern Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and rules imposed by nongovernment payors. Our inability to bill and collect on a timely basis pursuant to these regulations and rules could subject us to payment delays that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. It is possible that documentation support, system problems, Medicare, Medicaid or other payor issues, particularly in markets transitioning to managed care for the first time, or industry trends may extend our collection period, which may materially adversely affect our working capital, and our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk.\nThe timing of payments made under the Medicare and Medicaid programs is subject to governmental budgetary constraints, resulting in an increased period of time between submission of claims and subsequent payment under specific programs, most notably under the Medicaid and Medicaid managed programs, which typically pay claims approximately 30 to 60 days slower than the average hospital claim. In addition, we may experience delays in reimbursement as a result of the failure to receive prompt approvals related to change of ownership applications for acquired or other facilities or from delays caused by our or other third parties\u2019 information system failures. We may also experience delayed payment of reimbursement rate increases that are subject to the approval of the CMS and/or various state agencies before claims can be submitted or paid at the new rates. Any delays experienced for the foregoing or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, a delay in collecting our accounts receivable, or the non-collection of accounts receivable in connection with our transition and integration of acquired companies, including Simplura, and the attendant movement of underlying billing and collection operations from legacy systems to our systems could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity.\nOur reported financial results could suffer if there is an impairment of long-lived assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, to review the carrying value of long-lived assets to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may be impaired. Factors that may necessitate an impairment assessment include, among others, significant adverse changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, significant adverse changes in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or significant declines in the observable market value of an asset. Where the presence or occurrence of those events indicates that an asset may be impaired, we assess its recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the asset. If such testing indicates the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, we estimate the fair value of the asset using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. If the fair value of those assets is less than carrying value, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our intangible assets may result in different values for those assets, which could result in an impairment or, in the period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge.\nIn addition, goodwill may be impaired if the estimated fair value of our reporting units is less than the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. As a result of our growth, in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. For example, goodwill generated in relation to the acquisition of Simplura Health Group in 2020 was $309.7 million. We perform an analysis on our goodwill balances to test for impairment on an annual basis. Interim impairment tests may also be required in advance of our annual impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value, including goodwill, of our reporting unit below the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value. Such circumstances could include: (1) loss of significant contracts; (2) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the climate of our business; (3) unanticipated competition; (4) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; or (5) a significant decline in our stock price.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of goodwill, intangibles, equity method investments, and property and equipment, net was $444.9 million, $345.7 million, $137.5 million and $27.5 million, respectively. We continue to monitor the carrying value of these long-lived assets. If future conditions are different from management\u2019s estimates at the time of an acquisition or market conditions change subsequently, we may incur future charges for impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets, equity method investments or property and equipment, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nFailure to maintain or to develop further reliable, efficient and secure IT systems would be disruptive to our operations and diminish our ability to compete and successfully grow our business.\nWe are highly dependent on efficient and uninterrupted performance of our IT and business systems. These systems quote, process and service our business, and perform financial functions necessary for pricing and service delivery. These systems must also be able to undergo periodic modifications and improvements without interruptions or untimely delays in service. Additionally, our ability to integrate our systems with those of our clients is critical to our success. Our information systems rely on the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources to maintain and enhance existing systems as well as develop and create new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory requirements. Nevertheless, we still rely on manual processes and procedures, including accounting, reporting and consolidation processes that may result in errors and may not scale proportionately with our business growth, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure or delay to achieve improvements in our IT platforms could interrupt certain processes or degrade business operations and could place us at a competitive disadvantage. If we are unable to implement appropriate systems, procedures and controls, we may not be able to successfully offer our services and grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to attracting and retaining qualified employees, which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business success depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to identify, attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and experienced employees who possess the skills and experience necessary to deliver high-quality services to our clients, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success. Our objective of\nproviding the highest quality of service to our clients is a significant consideration when we evaluate the education, experience and qualifications of potential candidates for employment as direct care and administrative staff. A portion of our staff is professionals with requisite educational backgrounds and professional certifications. These employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors, including our ability to offer competitive wages, benefits and professional growth opportunities. While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future. Some of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel may have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, name recognition and a larger number of clients and payors than we do, which may prove more attractive to employment candidates. The inability to attract and retain experienced personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe performance of our business also depends on the talents and efforts of our highly skilled IT professionals. Our success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate these individuals. Effective succession planning is also important to our future success. If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management, our ability to execute short and long-term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be materially adversely affected.\nAny acquisition or acquisition integration efforts that we undertake could disrupt our business, not generate anticipated results, dilute stockholder value and have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur growth strategy involves the evaluation of potential entry into complementary markets and service lines through acquisition, particularly with opportunities that may leverage the advantages inherent in our large-scale technology-enabled operations and networks. We have made acquisitions and anticipate that we will continue to consider and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities, the success of which depends in part on our ability to integrate an acquired company into our business operations. Integration of any acquired company will place significant demands on our management, systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. This could require us to incur significant expense for, among other things, hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our IT infrastructure. The nature of our business is such that qualified management personnel can be difficult to find. Our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nFor example, the successful integration of our Personal Care Segment business acquired in the Simplura transaction into those of our own and our ability to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022the challenges and unanticipated costs associated with integrating complex organizations, systems, operating procedures, compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets;\n\u2022the difficulties harmonizing differences in the business cultures;\n\u2022the inability to successfully combine our respective businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from the acquisition;\n\u2022the challenges associated with known and unknown legal or financial liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022the risk of entering markets in which we have little or no experience;\n\u2022the challenges associated with the incurrence of indebtedness and the assumption of new contracts associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022the inability to minimize the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns during the process of integrating our businesses;\n\u2022the inability to resolve potential conflicts that may arise relating to customer, supplier and other important relationships;\n\u2022the difficulties in retaining key management and other key employees; and\n\u2022the challenge of managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company and coordinating geographically separate organizations.\nWe incurred substantial expenses to complete the acquisition, but we may not realize the anticipated cost benefits and other benefits to the extent expected, on the timeline expected, or at all. Moreover, competition in this industry may also cause us not to fully realize the anticipated benefits of this acquisition.\nThere can also be no assurance that the companies we acquire, including our Personal Care Segment, will generate income or incur expenses at the historical or projected levels on which we based our acquisition decisions, that we will be able to maintain or renew the acquired companies\u2019 contracts, that we will be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration of acquired companies or that the acquisitions will not adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, as we expand our markets or otherwise take advantage of prospects for growth, in connection with our acquisition strategy, we could issue stock that could dilute existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, or we could incur or assume substantial debt or contingent liabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisition or integration and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.\nOur estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxation in both the United States and, due to our ownership of international entities prior to the sale of our workforce development services segment, ten foreign countries, including specific states or provinces where we operated that segment. Our total income tax provision is a function of applicable local tax rates and the geographic mix of our income from continuing and discontinued operations before taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix, or foreign exchange rates could reduce our after-tax income and negatively impact our financial results.\nOur total income tax provision is based on our taxable income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate or operated. Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions and related matters. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation. In addition, we make or were required to make judgments regarding the applicability of tax treaties and the appropriate application of transfer pricing regulations with respect to the operations of our former workforce development services segment. In the event one taxing jurisdiction disagrees with another taxing jurisdiction with respect to the amount or applicability of a particular type of tax, or the amount or availability of a particular type of tax refund or credit, we could experience temporary or permanent double taxation and increased professional fees to resolve such taxation matters.\nOur determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities, and we have been audited by various jurisdictions in prior years. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service as a result of the large refund received from the loss on the sale or our former workforce development services segment. In addition, we are being examined by various states and by the Saudi Arabian tax authorities with respect to these matters. Although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree. The ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from the estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of our operations.\nRisks Related to Our NEMT Segment\nThere can be no assurance that our contracts will survive as contemplated until the end of their stated terms, or that upon their expiration will be renewed or extended on satisfactory terms, if at all, and disruptions to, the early expiration or renegotiation of, or the failure to renew our contracts could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur NEMT Segment contracts are subject to frequent renewal and, from time to time, requests for renegotiation during a contract term. For example, many of our state Medicaid contracts, which represented 49.3% of our NEMT Segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, have terms ranging from three to five years and are typically subject to a competitive procurement process near the end of the term. We also contract with MCOs, which represented 50.7% of our NEMT Segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our MCO contracts for NEMT Segment services typically continue until terminated by either party upon reasonable notice in accordance with the terms of the contract, and sometimes a contractual counterparty will seek to renegotiate the pricing and other terms of a contract to our detriment prior to the stated termination date of a contract. We cannot anticipate if, when or to what extent we will be successful in renewing our state Medicaid contracts or retaining our MCO contracts through their contractual duration on terms originally negotiated or at all. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, 22.0% of our NEMT Segment revenue was generated under state Medicaid contracts that are subject to renewal during 2021.\nIn addition, with respect to many of our state contracts, the payor may terminate the contract without cause, or for convenience, at will and without penalty to the payor, either immediately or upon the expiration of a short notice period in the event that, among other reasons, government appropriations supporting the programs serviced by the contract are reduced or eliminated. We cannot anticipate if, when or to what extent a payor might terminate a contract with us prior to its expiration, or fail to renew or extend a contract with us. If we are unable to retain or renew our contracts, or replace lost contracts, on satisfactory terms, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. While we pursue new contract awards and also undertake efficiency measures, there can be no assurance that such measures will fully offset the negative impact of contracts that are not renewed or are canceled on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively in the markets for our services.\nWe compete for clients and for contracts with a variety of organizations that offer similar services. Many organizations of varying sizes compete with us, including local not-for-profit organizations and community-based organizations, larger companies, organizations that currently provide or may begin to provide similar NEMT services (including transportation network companies such as Uber and Lyft) and CHA providers. Some of these companies may have greater financial, technical, political, marketing, name recognition and other resources and a larger number of clients or payors than we do. In addition, some of these companies offer more services than we do. To remain competitive, we must provide superior services and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers.\nThe market in which we operate is influenced by technological developments that affect cost-efficiency and quality of services, and the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services that address these changing needs and to provide technology needed to deliver these services on a cost-effective basis. Our competitors may better utilize technology to change the way services in our industry are designed and delivered and they may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities than we can provide, including better contract terms, technical qualifications, price and availability of qualified professional personnel. In addition, new or disruptive technologies and methodologies by our competitors may make our services uncompetitive. For example, advances in telehealth may reduce the number of in-person visits an end-user may be required to make to healthcare providers in order to receive care, which could reduce the utilization of our NEMT services.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from new entrants into the markets in which we operate. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of or failure to gain clients or payors, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our business may also be adversely affected by the consolidation of competitors, which may result in increased pricing pressure or negotiating leverage with payors, or by the provision of our services by payors or clients directly, including through the acquisition of competitors.\nWe obtain a significant portion of our business through responses to government requests for proposals and we may not be awarded contracts through this process in the future, or contracts we are awarded may not be profitable.\nWe obtain, and will continue to seek to obtain, a significant portion of our business from state government entities, which generally entails responding to a government request for proposal, or RFP. To propose effectively, we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations and submit the most attractive proposal with respect to both technical and price specifications. We must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within rigid and often short timetables. Our ability to respond successfully to an RFP will greatly affect our business. If we misinterpret bid requirements as to performance criteria or do not accurately estimate performance costs in a binding bid for an RFP, there can be no assurance that we will be able to modify the proposed contract and we may be required to perform under a contract that is not profitable, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, we could be liable for damages and financial penalties, which may place existing pledged performance and payment bonds at risk as well as harm our ability to keep our existing contracts or obtain new contracts and future bonds, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with our contractual obligations could, in addition to providing grounds for immediate termination of the contract for cause, negatively impact our financial performance and damage our reputation, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain current contracts or obtain new contracts. The termination of a contract for cause could, for instance, subject us to liabilities for excess costs incurred by a payor in obtaining similar services\nfrom another source. In addition, our contracts require us to indemnify payors for our failure to meet standards of care, and some of them contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties if we breach these contracts, which amounts could be material. For example, we have a minimum volume commitment under one of our transportation-related contracts. To the extent our actual use is less than the minimum commitment for a specified period, we may be subject to significant expense, without the benefit of corresponding revenue. Our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential financial damages, the impact of which could be materially adverse to our business and reputation\nIf we fail to estimate accurately the cost of performing certain contracts, we may experience reduced or negative margins and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, 86.2%, 84.6% and 79.2% of our NEMT Segment revenue, respectively, was generated under capitated contracts with the remainder generated through FFS and flat fee contracts. Under most of our capitated contracts, we assume the responsibility of managing the needs of a specific geographic population by contracting out transportation services to local transportation companies on a per ride or per mile basis. We use \u201cpricing models\u201d to determine applicable contract rates, which take into account factors such as estimated utilization, state specific data, previous experience in the state or with similar services, the medically covered programs outlined in the contract, identified populations to be serviced, estimated volume, estimated transportation provider rates and availability of mass transit. The amount of the fixed per-member, monthly fee is determined in the bidding process, but is predicated on actual historical transportation data for the subject geographic region as provided by the payor, actuarial work performed in-house as well as by third party actuarial firms and actuarial analysis provided by the payor. If the utilization of our services is more than we estimated, the contract may be less profitable than anticipated, or may not be profitable at all. Under our FFS contracts, we receive fees based on our interactions with government-sponsored clients. To earn a profit on these contracts, we must accurately estimate costs incurred in providing services. If the client population relating to these contracts is not large enough to cover our fixed costs, such as rent and overhead, our operating results could be materially adversely affected and our profitability impaired. Our FFS contracts are not reimbursed on a cost basis; therefore, if we fail to estimate our costs accurately, we may experience reduced margins or losses on these contracts. Revenue under certain contracts may be adjusted prospectively if client volumes are below expectations. If we are unable to adjust our costs accordingly, our profitability may be negatively affected. In addition, certain contracts with state Medicaid agencies are renewable or extended at the state\u2019s option without an adjustment to pricing terms. If such renewed contracts require us to incur higher costs, including inflation or regulatory changes, than originally anticipated, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe NEMT Segment may be adversely impacted if the drivers we engage as independent contractors were instead classified as employees.\nWe believe that the drivers we engage to provide rider benefits are properly classified as independent contractors and that these drivers are not our employees. Changes to federal, state or local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial or administrative challenges to our classification of these drivers as independent contractors, could affect the status of these drivers as independent contractors. A change in the classification of these drivers from independent contractors to employees could increase materially our expenses associated with the delivery of our services, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant interruptions in communication and data services could adversely affect our business.\nOur contact centers are significantly dependent on telephone, internet and data service provided by various communication companies. Any disruption of these services could adversely affect our business. We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to service disruptions by investing in complex and multi-layered redundancies, and we can transition services among our different call centers. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that the redundancies we have in place would be sufficient to maintain the call centers' operations without disruption. Any disruption could harm our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Personal Care Segment\nCompetition among in-home personal care, or home healthcare, services companies is intense, and if we are not successful executing on our strategies in the face of this competition, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe in-home personal care services industry, which is sometimes referred to as the home healthcare services industry, is highly competitive. Our Personal Care Segment competes with a variety of other companies in providing personal care services, some of which may have greater financial and other resources and may be more established in their respective communities. Competing companies may offer newer or different services from those offered by us, which may attract\ncustomers who are presently receiving our in-home personal care services to those other companies. Competing companies may also offer services across a greater continuum of care and therefore may be able to obtain new cases or retain patients that might otherwise choose us. In the areas in which our in-home personal care programs are provided, we also compete with a large number of organizations, including:\n\u2022community-based home healthcare providers;\n\u2022hospital-based home healthcare agencies;\n\u2022rehabilitation centers, including those providing home healthcare services;\n\u2022adult day care centers;\n\u2022assisted living centers;\n\u2022skilled nursing facilities; and\n\u2022fiscal intermediaries that process payroll and undertake other administrative responsibilities related to the provision of care by a patient\u2019s family members or other directly-hired personal assistants.\nSome of our current and potential competitors have or may obtain significantly greater marketing and financial resources to promote their programs than we have or may obtain. We compete based on the availability of personnel, the quality of services, the expertise of staff and, in some instances, the price of the services. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in our local markets. Accordingly, other companies, including hospitals and other healthcare organizations that are not currently providing in-home personal care services, may expand their services to include those services or similar services. We may encounter increased competition in the future that could negatively impact patient referrals to us, and limit our ability to maintain or increase our market position, the effect of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf any large, national healthcare entities that do not currently directly compete with us move into the in-home personal care market, competition could significantly increase. Larger, national healthcare entities have significant financial resources and extensive technology infrastructure. In addition, companies that currently compete with respect to some of our personal care services could begin competing with additional services through the acquisition of an existing company or de novo expansion into these services. Additionally, consolidation, especially by way of the acquisition of any of our competitors by any large, national healthcare entity, could also lead to increased competition.\nState certificates of need, or CON, laws, which often limit the ability of competitors to enter into a given market, are not uniform throughout the United States and are frequently the subject of efforts to limit or repeal such laws. If states remove existing CON laws, we could face increased competition in these states. Further, we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success in entering the markets we serve depends on referrals from physicians, hospitals, nursing homes, service coordination agencies, MCOs, health plans and other sources in the communities we serve and on our ability to maintain good relationships with existing referral sources. Our referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer patients to us and may refer their patients to other providers. Our growth and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of personal care services by our referral sources and their patients. Our loss of, or failure to maintain, existing relationships or our failure to develop new referral relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany states have CON laws or other regulatory and licensure obligations that may adversely affect the successful integration of our personal care service lines and that may adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets and thereby limit our ability to grow and increase net patient service revenue.\nMany states have enacted CON laws that require prior state approval to open new healthcare facilities or expand services at existing facilities. In such states, expansion by existing providers or entry into the market by new providers is permitted only where a given amount of unmet need exists, resulting either from population increases or a reduction in competing providers. These states ration the entry of new providers or services and the expansion of existing providers or services in their markets through a CON process, which is periodically evaluated and updated as required by applicable state law. The process is intended to promote comprehensive healthcare planning, assist in providing high-quality healthcare at the lowest possible cost and avoid unnecessary duplication by ensuring that only those healthcare facilities and operations that are\nneeded will be built and opened. New York, New Jersey, and West Virginia have CON laws applicable to the in-home personal care services we provide.\nIn every state where required, our home healthcare offices and personal care centers possess a license and/or CON issued by the state health authority that determines the local service areas for the home healthcare office or personal care center. In general, the process for opening a home healthcare office or personal care center begins by a provider submitting an application for licensure and certification to the state and federal regulatory bodies, which is followed by a testing period of transmitting data from the applicant to the CMS. Once this process is complete, the care center receives a provider agreement and corresponding number and can begin billing for services that it provides unless a CON is required. For those states that require a CON, the provider must also complete a separate application process before billing can commence and receive required approvals for capital expenditures exceeding amounts above prescribed thresholds. Our failure or inability to obtain any necessary approvals could adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our Personal Care Segment services and facilities in existing markets.\nIf a state with CON laws finds that there is an over-abundance of one type of Medicaid provider within the state, it may, for a period of time, impose a moratorium against the issuance of new Medicaid licenses for that type of service. While a moratorium would not prohibit us from continuing to provide services for which we are already licensed in that state, it may prevent us from entering a new state de novo, which could limit our expansion opportunities, affect our ability to execute on our business strategies and materially harm our business and operations.\nWe may not, absent the consent of the New York Department of Health, be able to manage the day to day operations of the licensed in-home personal care services agency business in the State of New York acquired in connection with the acquisition of our Personal Care Segment, which would have an adverse impact on our expected results from that acquisition and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur operation of our licensed in-home personal care services agency business in the State of New York is subject to a \u201cno control\u201d affidavit process. We submitted our relevant information associated with this process concurrently with the closing of the Simplura acquisition, but while we wait for necessary approvals, we will be limited in our ability to exercise control over the personal care business there for operational matters until such time that our ownership of that business is approved by the New York Department of Health. We can provide no assurance regarding the timing of the approval of this change of ownership by the New York Department of Health, or that such approval will be obtained at all. During this time, we cannot exercise day to day management of these entities, and the former management of Simplura will continue to operate the business. There is no prohibition on these entities making cash distributions to us during this interim period, but there can be no assurance that we will obtain the necessary authorization from the New York Department of Health to remove the \u201cno control\u201d affidavit and operate this business ourselves. If we are not able to ultimately take over control of these operations, or if we are only able to do so on a more limited basis than anticipated, we may not achieve the synergies and operational benefits expected from the Simplura acquisition as contemplated and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may have acquired liabilities that are not known to us in connection with the acquisition of our Personal Care Segment, the inadvertent acquisition of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nOur Personal Care Segment may have been acquired with liabilities that we failed, or were unable, to discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigations associated with the transaction. We cannot assure you that the indemnification available to us under the purchase agreement associated with the acquisition will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the acquisition. We may learn additional information about this business that materially adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the case-mix of our personal care patients, as well as payor mix and payment methodologies, may have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nThe sources and amounts of our patient revenues are determined by a number of factors, including the mix of patients and the rates of reimbursement among payors. Changes in the case-mix of the patients as well as payor mix among private pay, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as specialty programs, including waiver programs within Medicaid, may significantly affect our profitability. In particular, any significant increase in our Medicaid population or decrease in Medicaid payments could\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flow, particularly if states operating these programs continue to limit, or more aggressively seek limits on, reimbursement rates or service levels.\nOur loss of existing favorable managed care contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere is a risk that our existing favorable managed care contracts could be terminated. Managed care contracts typically permit us or the payor to terminate the contract without cause, typically within 90 days, which can provide payors leverage to reduce volume or obtain favorable pricing. Our failure to negotiate and put in place favorable managed care contracts, or our failure to maintain in place favorable managed care contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe personal care industry has historically experienced shortages in qualified employees and management, which could harm our business.\nOur personal care services compete with other healthcare providers for both professional and management level employees. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel depends on several factors, including our ability to provide these personnel with attractive assignments for the desired number of hours per week and competitive compensation and benefits. We cannot be assured we will succeed in any of these areas. As the demand for personal care services continues to exceed the supply of available and qualified personnel, our competitors may be forced to offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to these professionals. Furthermore, the competitive market for this labor force has created turnover as many seek to take advantage of the supply of available positions, each offering new and more attractive wage and benefit packages. In addition to the wage pressures inherent in this environment, including any changes to minimum wage, the cost of training new employees amid the turnover rates may cause added pressure on our operating results and harm our business.\nOur personal care business may be adversely impacted by labor relations.\nApproximately 1,400 of our hourly caregivers are unionized in regions of New York. Certain collective bargaining agreements with the 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers East are currently being negotiated, and others will require renegotiation upon expiration. We may not be able to negotiate terms that are satisfactory to the labor unions, and ultimate agreement may be on terms unfavorable to us. In addition, a unionized work force poses the risk of work stoppages, which if initiated could materially harm our results of operations as well as our commercial relationships with our customers if we are unable to perform under our contracts with them during any such stoppage.\nIf additional regions in which we operate become unionized, or if we expand our personal care operations into geographic areas where healthcare workers historically have been unionized, being subject to additional collective bargaining agreements may have a negative impact on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel and may increase our operating costs. Generally, if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, the quality of our services may decline and we could lose patients and referral sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Personal Care Segment may be subject to malpractice or other similar claims.\nThe services our Personal Care Segment offers involve an inherent risk of professional liability and related substantial damage awards. Due to the nature of our personal care business, we, through our employees and caregivers who provide services on our behalf, may be the subject of medical malpractice claims. A court could find these individuals should be considered our agents, and, as a result, we could be held liable for their acts or omissions. Claims of this nature, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees. While we maintain malpractice liability coverage that we believe is appropriate given the nature and breadth of our operations, any claims against us in excess of insurance limits, or multiple claims requiring us to pay deductibles, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Matrix Investment Segment\nOur investment in Matrix could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our equity investment\u2019s financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and Matrix and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of Matrix, and could materially and adversely affect the value of our consolidated assets.\nWe hold a non-controlling interest in Matrix, which, as of December 31, 2020, constituted 9.6% of our consolidated assets. We do not have unilateral power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Matrix\u2019s economic performance. The arrangement with Matrix involves risks not present with respect to our wholly-owned subsidiaries and that may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations or make the arrangement less successful than anticipated. Factors that may negatively impact the success of our Matrix investment include the following:\n\u2022we may be unable to take actions that we believe are appropriate but are opposed by Matrix under arrangements that require us to cede or share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the company and any property owned by the company, such as the sale or financing of the business or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the business;\n\u2022Matrix management may take actions that we oppose;\n\u2022we may be unable to sell or transfer our investment to a third party if we fail to obtain the prior consent of our investment partner;\n\u2022Matrix may become bankrupt or the majority member may fail to fund its share of required capital contributions, which could adversely impact the investment or increase our financial commitment to the investment;\n\u2022Matrix may have business interests or goals with respect to a business that conflict with our business interests and goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the business;\n\u2022disagreements with Matrix could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our management, and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the business, including the delay of important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and\n\u2022we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by Matrix with respect to our investment.\nIf any of the foregoing events were to transpire, our results of operations and liquidity position could be materially adversely affected and our business could be materially harmed.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulations\nHealthcare is a heavily regulated industry, and compliance with existing laws is costly, and non-compliance has the potential to be even costlier considering that violations of laws may result in corrective action or sanctions that could reduce our revenue and profitability.\nThe United States healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal and state oversight relating to, among other things:\n\u2022professional licensure;\n\u2022conduct of operations;\n\u2022addition of facilities, equipment and services, including certificates of need, or CON;\n\u2022coding and billing related to our services; and\n\u2022payment for services.\nBoth federal and state government agencies have increased coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts related to the healthcare industry. Regulations related to the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of those laws. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as the attempts to invalidate all or portions of those laws in ongoing legislation, has also introduced a degree of regulatory uncertainty, as the industry does not know how the changes it introduced or changes to it will affect many aspects of the industry.\nMedicare and Medicaid anti-fraud and abuse laws prohibit certain business practices and relationships related to items and services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce or arrange for referral of patients or recommendation for the provision of items or services covered by Medicare or Medicaid or any other federal or state healthcare program, often referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute. Federal and state laws also prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims, including claims to obtain reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid, under what is commonly referred to as the False Claims Act. We have implemented policies to help assure our compliance with these regulations as they become effective, but interpretations different from our interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations in the future could subject our practices to allegations of impropriety, illegality, or overpayment, or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services or the manner in which we conduct our business, any of which could increase costs and could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanges to the regulatory landscape applicable to our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Personal Care Segment locations that maintain a Medicare certified home healthcare line of business (for example, in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts) must comply with ever changing federal conditions or participation, where compliance is difficult to achieve and hard to monitor. Recently implemented requirements for which adherence is particularly challenging include the need to:\n\u2022Provide transfer summary to facility within two days of a planned transfer or within two business days of becoming aware of an unplanned transfer if the patient is still receiving care in the facility;\n\u2022Provide written notice of patient\u2019s rights and responsibilities, and transfer and discharge policies to a patient-selected representative within four business days of the initial evaluation visit;\n\u2022Communicate revisions to the plan of care due to change in health status to the patient, representative (if any), caregiver and physicians issuing orders for plan of care; and\n\u2022Communicate discharge plan revisions to the patient, representative (if any), caregiver, all physicians issuing orders for the plan of care and to the provider expected to care for the patient after discharge (if any).\nCMS could adopt new requirements or guidelines that may further increase the costs associated with the provision of certified services, which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn New York, we provide Service Coordination, or SC, and/or Home and Community Support Services, or HCSS, to 731 Traumatic Brain Injury, or TBI, and Nursing Home Transition and Diversion, or NHTD, Medicaid waiver participants. These waiver programs were developed based on the philosophy that individuals with disabilities, individuals with traumatic brain injury, and seniors, may be successfully served and included in their surrounding communities so long as the individual is the primary decision maker and works in cooperation with care providers to develop a plan of services that promotes personal independence, greater community inclusion, self-reliance and participation in meaningful activities and services. Examples of activities that are at various stages of implementation that may implicate or materially adversely affect our waiver line of business profitability follow.\n\u2022Conflict Free Case Management - The NYS DOH, in collaboration with CMS, is implementing mandatory conflict-free case management policies. Conflict-free case management requires the separation of clinical eligibility determinations and care planning assessments (for example, SC) from the direct provision of services (for example, HCSS). Providers in the personal care industry are expected to implement additional conflict of interest standards that may or may not ultimately require the creation of legally separate entities with distinct protocols.\n\u2022Managed Long-Term Care Carve-In - Managed Long-Term Care, or MLTC, is a system believed to streamline the delivery of long-term care services to people who are chronically ill or disabled and who wish to reside, or continue to reside, safely in their homes and communities. The entire array of services to which an enrolled member is entitled can be received through the MLTC plan a particular member has chosen. As New York transforms its long-term care system to one that ensures care management for all, enrollment in a MLTC plan may be mandatory or voluntary, depending on individual circumstances. While TBI and NHTD participants are currently excluded from having to enroll in a MLTC plan (for example, SC and HCSS claims are billed and paid on a Medicaid fee-for-service basis), the NYS DOH submitted a transition plan to CMS for consideration that eliminates the exclusion, meaning that TBI and NHTD waiver participants who wish to continue receiving services must enroll in a plan. While the primary goal stated was to improve access to all services across the state, the result may also require our navigation of network participation requirements and typical managed care cost control measures (for example, authorizations, utilization review, rate negotiation).\nRegarding in-home personal care generally (including certified or non-certified and waiver or non-waiver), compliance with responsibilities under the Fair Labor Standards Act, or FLSA, remains key. The United States Department of Labor, or DOL, continues its focus on the industry to ensure that personal care workers earn a minimum wage and are afforded various overtime pay protections. We may be sued individually or by a class of workers claiming that a violation has occurred, or a complaint may be filed with the DOL to investigate. If it is ultimately found that we neglected to pay the full amount of wages owed under the FLSA (for meals, breaks, travel, or otherwise), payment for the missing amount and possibly double that amount may be mandated, which could materially increase our costs and harm our results of operations.\nWith respect to our Matrix Investment Segment, the CHA services industry is primarily regulated by federal and state healthcare laws and the requirements of participation and reimbursement of the MA program established by CMS. From time to time, CMS considers changes to regulatory guidelines with respect to prospective CHAs or the risk adjusted payment system\napplicable to Matrix\u2019s MA plan customers. CMS could adopt new requirements or guidelines that may, for example, increase the costs associated with CHAs, limit the opportunities and settings available to administer CHAs, or otherwise change the risk adjusted payment system in a way that would adversely impact our business. Further, changes in or adoption of new state laws governing the scope of practice of mid-level practitioners, or more restrictive interpretations of such laws, may restrict Matrix\u2019s ability to provide services using nurse practitioners. Any such implementation of additional regulations on the CHA industry by CMS or other regulatory bodies or further regulation of mid-level practitioners could have a material adverse impact on Matrix\u2019s revenues and margins, which could have a material adverse impact on our balance sheet and financial position.\nThe cost of our services is funded substantially by government and private insurance programs, and changes in budgetary priorities of the government entities or private insurance programs that fund these services could result in the loss of contracts, a reduction in reimbursement rates, or a decrease in amounts payable to us under our contracts.\nPayments for our services are largely derived from contracts that are directly or indirectly paid by government agencies with public funds and private insurance companies. All of these contracts are subject to legislative appropriations and state and/or national budget approval, as well as changes to potential eligibility for services. The availability of funding under our contracts with state governments is dependent in part upon federal funding to states. Changes in Medicaid provider reimbursement and federal matching funds methodologies may further reduce the availability of federal funds to states in which we provide services.\nCurrently, many of the states in which we operate are facing budgetary shortfalls or changes in budgetary priorities. While many of these states are dealing with budgetary concerns by shifting costs from institutional care to home and community-based care such as we provide, there is no assurance that this trend will continue or be implemented as it has been historically. For example, in New York (one of several states where our Personal Care Segment provides services under the name \u201cAll Metro Health Care\u201d), there are Medicaid Redesign Team initiatives taking place aimed at reducing Medicaid expense through provider consolidation and other measures. Our continued ability to provide core services, though expected, is now dependent upon various competitive bid processes, including the following:\n\u2022CDPAP Request for Offers (Pending Award) - The Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program, or CDPAP, is a Medicaid program that operates pursuant to section 365-f of the New York State Social Services Law, or SSL, and implementing regulations in section 505.28 of title 18 of the NY Codes Rules and Regulations, or NYCRR. CDPAP is designed and intended to permit eligible chronically ill and/or physically disabled individuals (referred to as consumers) that are eligible to receive home care services greater flexibility and freedom of choice in obtaining those services by self-directing their care. Under CDPAP, consumers may receive assistance with personal care services (authorized under SSL \u00a7 365-f), home health aide services, and skilled nursing tasks (authorized under Article 36 of the Public Health Law) performed by a consumer directed personal assistant, or PA, under the instruction, supervision, and direction of the consumer or the consumer\u2019s designated representative. The role of the Fiscal Intermediary, or FI, as set forth in SSL \u00a7 365-f, is to assist the consumer in carrying out his or her responsibilities by performing administrative services required in statute and regulation (SSL \u00a7 365-f(4-a)(a)(ii) and 18 NYCRR \u00a7 505.28 (i), respectively) including wage and benefit processing, processing all income tax and other required wage withholdings, and maintaining various types of records. Our Personal Care Segment currently serves as FI for 1,156 consumers. Following a transition period to be determined by the New York State Department Health, or NYS DOH, only those entities that have successfully entered into a contract under the terms of this request for offer may continue to provide FI services either directly or through contract with a Medicaid MCO.\n\u2022LHCSA Request for Proposal (Anticipated) - The recently enacted FY 2021 New York State Budget created a new Public Health Law, or PHL, Section 3605-c which, if implemented, would prohibit Licensed Home Care Service Agencies, or LHCSAs, such as our Personal Care Segment\u2019s 12 individually-licensed branches, from providing or claiming for services provided to Medicaid recipients without being authorized to do so by contract with the NYS DOH. This restriction would apply to the provision of such services under the state Medicaid plan, a plan waiver, or through an MCO (for example, managed long-term care plan). If implemented, the statute would require the NYS DOH to contract with only enough LHCSAs to ensure that Medicaid recipients have access to care. The NYS DOH is expected to post an RFP that includes demonstrated cultural and language competencies specific to the population of recipients and the available workforce, experience serving individuals with disabilities, and demonstrated compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations among the selection criteria. After contracts are awarded, the NYS DOH could terminate a LHCSA\u2019s contract, or suspend or limit a LHCSA\u2019s rights and privileges under a contract, upon thirty-days' written notice if the Commissioner of Health finds that a LHCSA has failed to comply with the provisions of Section 3605-c or any regulations promulgated under the statute. Also, authorization received by LHCSAs under PHL Section 3605-c would not substitute for satisfying existing licensure requirements or the screening and enrollment process required for participation in the Medicaid program.\nConsequently, a significant decline in government or private insurance company expenditures or the number of program beneficiaries, a shift of expenditures or funding away from programs that call for the types of services that we provide, or change in government contracting or funding policies could cause payors to terminate their contracts with us or reduce their expenditures or reimbursement rates under those contracts, either of which could have a negative impact on our financial position and operating results.\nWe are subject to regulations relating to privacy and security of patient and service user information, and our failure to comply with such regulations could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nThere are numerous federal and state regulations addressing patient information privacy and security concerns. In particular, the federal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that:\n\u2022protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of patient information;\n\u2022require the implementation of security safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form; and\n\u2022prescribe specific transaction formats and data code sets for certain electronic healthcare transactions.\nWe invest considerable time and resources in ensuring compliance with state and federal privacy laws and regulations, incurring substantial costs as a result. These costs and investments could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. Further, the HIPAA regulations and state privacy laws expose us to increased regulatory risk, as the penalties associated with a failure to comply or with information security breaches, even if unintentional, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to actions for false claims or recoupment of funds pursuant to certain audits for non-compliance with government coding and billing rules, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state documentation, coding and billing rules, we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties, loss of licenses and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results. In billing for our services to third-party clients, we must follow complex documentation, coding and billing rules. These rules are based on federal and state laws, rules and regulations, various government pronouncements, including guidance and notices, and industry practice. Failure to follow these rules could result in potential criminal or civil liability under the federal False Claims Act, under which extensive financial penalties can be imposed, or under various state statutes which prohibit the submission of false claims for services covered. Compliance failure could further result in criminal liability under various federal and state criminal or civil statutes. We may be subject to audits conducted by our clients or their proxies, including the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, for the Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, state Medicaid regulatory agencies, state Medicaid fraud enforcement agencies, health departments, CMS, the Unified Program Integrity Contractors and regional federal program integrity contractors for the Medicare and Medicaid programs that may result in recoupment of funds. In addition, our clients may be subject to certain audits that may result in recoupment of funds from our clients that may, in turn, implicate us. We could be adversely affected in the event such an audit results in negative findings and recoupment from or penalties to our customers.\nOur contracts are subject to stringent claims and invoice processing regimes which vary depending on the customer and nature of the payment mechanism. Government entities may take the position that if a transport cannot be matched to a medically necessary healthcare event, or is conducted inconsistently with contractual, regulatory or even policy requirements, payment for such transport may be recouped by such customer. Likewise, a government surveyor may determine that a personal care visit was not sufficiently supported by a time and attendance record and/or that the aide was not qualified on a particular date of service and seek a refund as a result.\nWhile we carefully and regularly review documentation, and coding and billing practices, the rules are frequently vague and confusing and they cannot ensure that governmental investigators, private insurers or private whistleblowers will not challenge our practices. Such a challenge could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to civil penalties and loss of business if we fail to comply with applicable bribery, corruption and other regulations governing business with public organizations.\nWe are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering,\npurchasing or leasing of items or services payable by a federally funded healthcare program. Any of our financial relationships with healthcare providers will be potentially implicated by this statute to the extent Medicare or Medicaid referrals are implicated. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 per violation, imprisonment of up to ten years, civil penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law of up to $100,000 per violation, plus three times the remuneration involved, civil penalties under the False Claims Act of up to $22,363 for each claim submitted, plus three times the amounts paid for such claims and exclusion from participation in the Medicaid and Medicare programs. Any such penalties could have a significant negative effect on our operations. Furthermore, the exclusion could result in significant reductions in our revenues, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to licensing regulations and other regulatory provisions, including provisions governing surveys and audits, and changes to, or violations of, these regulations could negatively impact us.\nIn many of the locations where we operate, we are required by local laws to obtain and maintain licenses. The applicable state and local licensing requirements govern the services we provide, the credentials of staff, record keeping, treatment planning, client monitoring and supervision of staff. The failure to maintain these licenses or the loss of a license could have a material adverse impact on us and could prevent us from providing services to clients in a given jurisdiction. Our contracts are subject to surveys or audit by our payors or clients. We are also subject to regulations that restrict our ability to contract directly with a government agency in certain situations. Such restrictions could affect our ability to contract with certain payors and clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur contracts are subject to audit and modification by the payors with whom we contract, at their sole discretion, and any such audits and modifications could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur businesses depend on our ability to perform successfully under various government funded contracts. Under the terms of these contracts, payors, government agencies or their proxy contractors can review our compliance or performance, as well as our records and general business practices, at any time, and may in their discretion:\n\u2022suspend or prevent us from receiving new contracts or extending existing contracts because of violations or suspected violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u2022terminate or modify our existing contracts;\n\u2022seek to recoup the amount we were paid and/or reduce the amount we are paid under our existing contracts; or\n\u2022audit and object to our contract related fees.\nAny increase in the number or scope of audits could increase our expenses, and the audit process may disrupt the day-to-day operations of our business and distract management. If payors have significant audit findings, or if they make material modifications to our contracts, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur existing debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur agreements covering our outstanding indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our Notes, contain various covenants that limit or will limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These agreements may, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022make loans, investments and capital expenditures;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create or incur liens;\n\u2022make distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022permit contractual obligations that burden our ability to make distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022make acquisitions; and\n\u2022consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nA breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the applicable agreements that govern our indebtedness, including as a result of cross default provisions, and, in the case of our Credit Facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our Credit Facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. In the event of acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness, we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay the debt or obtain new financing to refinance the debt. Even if new financing is made available to us, it may not be on terms acceptable to us. If we were unable to repay these amounts, certain debt holders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness, including the equity of subsidiary guarantors that we have pledged as collateral, pursuant to our Credit Agreement. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the value of our equity could be materially diminished.\nWe have substantial indebtedness and lease obligations that could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness and lease obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities and harm our operations and business.\nOur substantial indebtedness and lease obligations could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the Credit Facility. Our substantial indebtedness and lease obligations could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and lease payments under our leases, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under the Credit Facility, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness, including the Credit Facility and the Notes;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022imposing restrictions on the operation of our business that may hinder our ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities or to grow our business;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures (including real estate acquisitions), debt service requirements and general corporate or other purposes, which could be exacerbated by volatility in the credit markets; and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our competitors who are less leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. Any refinancing or restructuring of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. Further, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare such indebtedness be due and payable, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nExpiration of existing Credit Agreement, loss of available financing or an inability to renew, or refinance our debt could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe indebtedness subject to our Credit Agreement matures in August 2023 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to extend our indebtedness under our Credit Agreement or enter into a new one on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If our cash on hand is insufficient, or we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to cover our cash flow and liquidity needs and service our debt, we may be required to seek additional sources of funds, including extending or replacing our indebtedness under our Credit Agreement, refinancing all or a portion of our existing or future indebtedness, incurring\nadditional indebtedness to maintain sufficient cash flow to fund our ongoing operating needs and fund anticipated expenditures. There can be no assurance that any new financing or refinancing will be possible or obtained on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain needed financing, we may (i) be unable to satisfy our ongoing obligations, (ii) be unable to pursue future business opportunities or fund acquisitions, (iii) find it more difficult to fund future operating costs, tax payments or general corporate expenditures, and (iv) become vulnerable to adverse general economic, capital markets and industry conditions. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could impair our financial condition.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness to fund our activities, including to fund share repurchases, acquisitions, cash dividends and business expansion. While our Credit Agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Any additional indebtedness would increase the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of such indebtedness, and the risks that we already face as a result of our leverage would intensify. Future substantial indebtedness could also have other important consequences on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our existing obligations;\n\u2022make it more difficult to renew or enter into new contracts with existing and potential future clients;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, the execution of our business strategy or acquisitions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions;\n\u2022restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due;\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, as well as in government regulation and to our business; and\n\u2022expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates.\nOur ability to satisfy and manage our debt obligations depends on our ability to generate cash flow and on overall financial market conditions. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, or interest on our debt obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations and meet our other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell or curtail assets or operations, seek additional capital, or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we must sell or curtail our assets or operations, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of December 31, 2020, we had 19.6 million shares of common stock outstanding that were freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless held by or purchased by our \u201caffiliates\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Shares of our common stock held by or purchased by our affiliates are restricted or \u201ccovered\u201d securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, but will be eligible for resale subject to applicable volume, means of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nWith respect to our stockholders Coliseum Capital Co-Invest, L.P., Coliseum Capital Partners, L.P., Coliseum Capital Partners II, L.P. and Blackwell Partners, LLC - Series A, which we sometimes refer to collectively as the Coliseum Stockholders, any or all of which may continue to be considered an affiliate or affiliates of ours, we have filed a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act covering the resale by the Coliseum Stockholders of an aggregate of 1,542,055 shares of our common stock that continue to be held by the Coliseum Stockholders. As a result, such shares may be sold pursuant to the registration statement without regard to the volume and other limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act that would otherwise be applicable to such sales.\nWe also filed a registration statement under the Securities Act to register additional shares of common stock to be issued under our Amended and Restated 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or Incentive Plan, and, as a result, all shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of stock options or vesting of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units granted under our Incentive Plan will also be freely tradable under the Securities Act, unless purchased or acquired by our affiliates under the plan. As of December 31, 2020, there were vested stock options outstanding and exercisable to purchase a total of 54,546 shares of our common stock and there were 93,227 shares of our common stock subject to restricted stock awards under the plan. In addition, 1,250,381 shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuances under the Incentive Plan.\nOur annual operating results and stock price may be volatile or may decline significantly regardless of our operating performance.\nOur annual operating results and the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022changes in rates or coverage for services by payors;\n\u2022changes in Medicaid, Medicare or other United States federal or state rules, regulations or policies;\n\u2022market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole, including increases in the minimum wage requirements in various jurisdictions in which we operate, and fluctuations in the size of the Medicare member population as well as overall health of its members;\n\u2022increased competition, including through insourcing of services by our clients and new entrants to the market;\n\u2022negative effects from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, or responses to these events;\n\u2022changes in tax laws; and\n\u2022changes in accounting principles.\nIf any of these events or circumstances were to impact our results or stock price, our common stock price could decrease and the value of an investment in our common stock would experience a corresponding decrease.\nIn addition, the stock markets, and in particular NASDAQ, have experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we become involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nThe Company depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund all of its operations and expenses, including to make future dividend payments or to fund stock repurchases, if any, and there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will make available to us the funds necessary for us to fund our operations and capital needs.\nOur operations are conducted entirely through our subsidiaries. Our ability to generate cash to fund all of our operations and expenses, to pay dividends or complete stock repurchase programs, or to meet any debt service obligations is highly dependent on our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries by way of dividends or intercompany loans. We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our and our subsidiaries\u2019 future earnings, if any, to fund our growth, to develop our business, invest in our technology, for working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. To the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, however, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Similarly, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us to fund stock repurchases. Further, our Credit Agreement significantly restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets to us. In addition, Delaware law imposes solvency restrictions on our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares. Furthermore, if the subsidiaries are unable or unwilling to fund our cash needs when needed or desired, our results of operations and business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or publish misleading or unfavorable\nresearch about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, including provisions governing when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called, and provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. As a result of these provisions, holders of our common stock may not receive the full benefit of any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context.\nEven in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management, including provisions providing for staggered terms for our Board, no cumulative voting for the election of directors, and provisions governing director vacancies, which are filled only by remaining directors (including vacancies resulting from removal or other cause). These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 89824, "SIC": 4100, "TIC": "PRSC"}
