{"cik": "1355096", "company": "Liberty Interactive Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to our Company, the QVC Group and the Ventures Group\nThe risks described below apply to our company and to the businesses and assets attributable to the QVC Group (which we previously referred to as the Interactive Group) and the Ventures Group.\nThe historical financial information of the QVC Group and the Ventures Group included in this Form 10-K, may not necessarily reflect their results had they been separate companies. One of the reasons for the creation of a tracking stock is to permit equity investors to apply more specific criteria in valuing the shares of a particular group, such as comparisons of earnings multiples with those of other companies in the same business sector. In valuing shares of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock, investors should recognize that the historical financial information of the QVC Group and the Ventures Group has been extracted from our consolidated financial statements prior to and for a period of time following the LMC Split-Off, as well as prior to and for a period of time following the creation of the Ventures Group in August 2012, and may not necessarily reflect what the QVC Group\u2019s and the Ventures Group\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had the QVC Group and the Ventures Group been separate, stand-alone entities pursuing independent strategies during the periods presented.\nWe have identified a material weakness in QVC\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, that, if not properly remediated, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As described in \u201cItem 9A. -Controls and Procedures,\u201d we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2014 due to a material weakness at our wholly-owned subsidiary, QVC. Specifically, we identified a material weakness relating to the design and effectiveness of information technology general controls intended to ensure (i) that access to applications and data, and the ability to make program changes, were adequately restricted to appropriate personnel and (ii) that the activities of individuals with access to modify data and make program changes were appropriately monitored. This material weakness did not result in any misstatements of our consolidated financial statements and disclosures for any annual or interim period.\nAs further described in \u201cItem 9A. - Controls and Procedures,\u201d we and QVC are in the process of taking the necessary steps to remediate the material weakness that we identified and have made enhancements to QVC\u2019s control procedures; however, the material weakness will not be remediated until the necessary controls have been implemented and are determined to be operating effectively. Although no assurance can be given as to when the remediation plan will be completed, management believes the remediation efforts will be completed during the third quarter of 2015.\nI-20\nWe cannot assure you that our and QVC\u2019s efforts to fully remediate this internal control weakness will be successful or that additional or similar material weaknesses will not develop or be identified.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to QVC\u2019s internal controls may distract its officers and employees and entail material costs to implement new processes and/or modify its existing processes. Moreover, these changes do not guarantee that we will be effective in maintaining the adequacy of QVC\u2019s internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could harm our business. In addition, investors\u2019 perceptions that QVC\u2019s internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm our stock price.\nOur subsidiary QVC depends on the television distributors that carry its programming, and no assurance can be given that QVC will be able to maintain and renew its affiliation agreements on favorable terms or at all. QVC currently distributes its programming through affiliation or transmission agreements with many television providers, including, but not limited to, Comcast, DIRECTV, DISH Network, Time Warner Cable and Cox in the U.S., JCN, Jupiter Telecommunications, Ltd., Sky Perfect and World Hi-Vision Channel, Inc. in Japan, Kabel Deutschland Vertrieb und Service GmbH, Media Broadcast GmbH, SES ASTRA, SES Platform Services GmbH, Telekom Deutschland GmbH, Unitymedia Kabel BW GmbH, Tele Columbus and Primacom in Germany, A1 Telekom Austria AG and UPC Telekabel Wien GmbH in Austria, Arqiva, British Sky Broadcasting, Freesat, SDN and Virgin Media in the United Kingdom and Mediaset, Hot Bird and Sky Italia in Italy. QVC\u2019s affiliation agreements with its distributors are scheduled to expire between 2015 and 2022. As part of normal course renewal discussions, occasionally QVC has disagreements with its distributors over the terms of its carriage, such as channel placement or other contract terms. If not resolved through business negotiation, such disagreements could result in litigation or termination of an existing agreement. Termination of an existing agreement resulting in the loss of distribution of QVC\u2019s programming to a material portion of its television households may adversely affect its growth, net revenue and earnings. The renewal negotiation process for affiliation agreements is typically lengthy. In some cases, renewals are not agreed upon prior to the expiration of a given agreement while the programming continues to be carried by the relevant distributor without an effective agreement in place. QVC does not have distribution agreements with some of the cable operators that carry its programming. In total, QVC is currently providing programming without affiliation agreements to distributors representing approximately 6% of its U.S. distribution, and short-term, rolling 90 day letters of extension, to distributors who represent approximately 24% of its U.S. distribution. Some of QVC\u2019s international programming may continue to be carried by distributors after the expiration dates on its affiliation agreements with them have passed. QVC may be unable to obtain renewals with its current distributors on acceptable terms, if at all. QVC may also be unable to successfully negotiate affiliation agreements with new or existing distributors to carry its programming. Although QVC considers its current levels of distribution without written agreement to be ordinary course, the failure to successfully renew or negotiate new affiliation agreements covering a material portion of television households could result in a discontinuation of carriage that may adversely affect its viewership, growth, net revenue and earnings.\nOur programming and online commerce businesses depend on their relationships with third party suppliers and vendors and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our results of operation and those attributed to any of our groups. An important component of the success of our programming and online commerce businesses is their ability to maintain their existing, as well as build new, relationships with a limited number of local and foreign suppliers and vendors, among other parties. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries and business affiliates will be able to maintain their existing supplier or vendor arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all or, with respect to goods sourced from foreign markets, if the supply costs will remain stable. In addition, our subsidiaries and business affiliates cannot guarantee that goods produced and delivered by third parties will meet applicable quality\nI-21\nstandards, which is impacted by a number of factors, some which are not within the control of these parties. Adverse changes in existing relationships or the inability to enter into new arrangements with these parties on favorable terms, if at all, could cause a failure to meet customer expectations and timely delivery of products, which could in turn have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and those attributed to our groups.\nOur businesses attributed to each group are subject to risks of adverse government regulation. Our programming businesses, such as QVC and HSN, market and provide a broad range of merchandise through television shopping programs and proprietary websites. Similarly, our online commerce businesses, such as Expedia and the e-commerce companies, market and provide a broad range of merchandise and/or services through their proprietary websites. As a result, these businesses are subject to a wide variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to change at any time, including laws regarding consumer protection, privacy, the regulation of retailers generally, the license requirements for television retailers in foreign jurisdictions, the importation, sale and promotion of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities, as well as laws and regulations applicable to the Internet and businesses engaged in online commerce, such as those regulating the sending of unsolicited, commercial electronic mail. The failure by our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in a revocation of required licenses, fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies and/or consumers, which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, unfavorable changes in the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our businesses could decrease demand for our products and services, increase costs and/or subject our businesses to additional liabilities. Similarly, new disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new state or federal laws, such as regulatory rules regarding requirements to disclose efforts to identify the origin and existence of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d or abusive labor practices in portions of QVC\u2019s supply chain, could increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of operations. In addition, certain of these regulations may impact the marketing efforts of our brands and businesses.\nAs mentioned above, the manner in which certain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates sell and promote merchandise and related claims and representations made in connection with these efforts is regulated by federal, state and local law, as well as the laws of the foreign countries in which they operate. Certain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates may be exposed to potential liability from claims by purchasers or from regulators and law enforcement agencies, including, but not limited to, claims for personal injury, wrongful death and damage to personal property relating to merchandise sold and misrepresentation of merchandise features and benefits. In certain instances, these subsidiaries and business affiliates have the right to seek indemnification for related liabilities from their respective vendors and may require such vendors to carry minimum levels of product liability and errors and omissions insurance. These vendors, however, may be unable to satisfy indemnification claims, obtain suitable coverage or maintain this coverage on acceptable terms, or insurance may provide inadequate coverage or be unavailable with respect to a particular claim.\nIn addition, programming services, cable television systems, the Internet, telephony services and satellite service providers are subject to varying degrees of regulation in the United States by the FCC and other entities and in foreign countries by similar regulators. Such regulation and legislation are subject to the political process and have been in constant flux over the past decade. The application of various sales and use tax provisions under state, local and foreign law to the products and services of our subsidiaries and certain of our business affiliates sold via the Internet, television and telephone is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities, and no assurance can be given that such authorities will not take a contrary position to that taken by our subsidiaries and certain of our business affiliates, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. In addition, there have been numerous attempts at the federal, state and local levels to impose additional taxes on online commerce transactions. Moreover, most foreign countries in which our subsidiaries or business affiliates have, or may in the future make, an investment regulate, in varying degrees, the distribution, content and ownership of programming services and foreign investment in programming companies and the Internet.\nI-22\nIn addition, certain of our businesses are subject to consent decrees issued by the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) barring them from making deceptive claims for specified weight-loss products and dietary supplements and prohibiting them from making certain claims about specified weight-loss, dietary supplement and anti-cellulite products unless they have competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate such claims. Violation of these consent decrees may result in the imposition of significant civil penalties for non-compliance and related redress to consumers and/or the issuance of an injunction enjoining these businesses from engaging in prohibited activities. Further material changes in the law and increased regulatory requirements must be anticipated, and there can be no assurance that the businesses and assets attributed to each group will not become subject to increased expenses or more stringent restrictions as a result of any future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.\nWeak economic conditions worldwide may reduce consumer demand for our products and services. The prolonged economic uncertainty in various regions of the world in which our subsidiaries and affiliates operate could adversely affect demand for our products and services since a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from discretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls during times of economic instability. Global financial markets continue to experience disruptions, including increased volatility and diminished liquidity and credit availability. If economic and financial market conditions in the U.S. or other key markets, including Japan and Europe, remain uncertain, persist, or deteriorate further, customers of our subsidiaries and affiliates may respond by suspending, delaying, or reducing their discretionary spending. A suspension, delay or reduction in discretionary spending could adversely affect revenue across each of our tracking stock groups. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain revenue and earnings could be adversely affected to the extent that relevant economic environments remain weak or decline. Such weak economic conditions may also inhibit the expansion of our subsidiaries and affiliates into new European and other markets. We currently are unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.\nWe may be subject to significant tax liabilities related to the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off. In connection with the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off, we received a ruling from the IRS (\u201cRuling\u201d) and an opinion of tax counsel, in each case to the effect that the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off will qualify as a tax-free transaction to our company and to the holders of our Ventures Group tracking stock under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cCode\u201d). Although the Ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the Ruling does not address certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment to our company and the holders of our Ventures Group tracking stock as a result of the IRS\u2019s ruling policy with respect to transactions under Section 355 of the Code (and instead is based upon representations made by Liberty that these requirements have been satisfied), and the continuing validity of the Ruling is subject to the accuracy of representations and factual statements made by Liberty to the IRS. Further, an opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the conclusions expressed in such opinion could be challenged by the IRS, and a court could sustain such challenge. In October 2014, the IRS completed its examination of the TripAdvisor Holding Spin-Off and notified Liberty that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transaction. If it is determined, for whatever reason, that the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off does not qualify for tax-free treatment, our company and/or the holders of our Ventures Group tracking stock could incur significant tax liabilities.\nPrior to the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with TripAdvisor Holdings. Under this agreement, our company is generally responsible for any taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off to qualify as a tax-free transaction; however, TripAdvisor Holdings is required to indemnify our company for any taxes and losses which (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by TripAdvisor Holdings (applicable to actions or failures to act by TripAdvisor Holdings and its subsidiaries following the completion of the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off), or (ii) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off as a result of the treatment of the TripAdvisor Holdings\nI-23\nSpin-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in the stock of TripAdvisor Holdings or any successor corporation. As the taxpaying entity, however, we are subject to the risk of non-payment by TripAdvisor Holdings of its indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off, we may determine to forego certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to our company, including certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off. In addition, our potential tax liabilities related to the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control transaction for some period of time following the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off.\nRapid technological advances could render the products and services offered by our subsidiaries and our business affiliates attributed to our QVC Group and our Ventures Group obsolete or non-competitive. Our subsidiaries and business affiliates attributed to each group must stay abreast of rapidly evolving technological developments and offerings to remain competitive and increase the utility of their services. As their operations grow in size and scope, our subsidiaries and business affiliates must continuously improve and upgrade their systems and infrastructure while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of their systems and infrastructure. These subsidiaries and business affiliates must be able to incorporate new technologies into their products and services in order to address the needs of their customers. The emergence of alternative platforms such as mobile and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology. New developments in other areas, such as cloud computing, could also make it easier for competition to enter their markets due to lower up-front technology costs. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries and business affiliates will be able to compete with advancing technology or be able to maintain existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as they would like or in a cost-effective manner, and any failure to do so could result in customers seeking alternative service providers and may adversely affect the group to which they are attributed, thereby adversely impacting our revenue and operating income.\nOur subsidiaries and business affiliates attributed to each of our QVC and Ventures Groups conduct their businesses under highly competitive conditions. Although QVC and HSN are two of the nation\u2019s largest home shopping networks, they and the e-commerce businesses attributed to the Ventures Group have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, electronic retailers, direct marketing retailers, wholesale clubs, discount retailers, infomercial retailers, internet retailers, and mail-order and catalog companies. In addition, QVC competes with HSN as well as other televised shopping retailers, such as EVINE Live in the U.S., Shop Channel in Japan, HSE 24 in Germany and Ideal World in the United Kingdom. QVC also competes for access to customers and audience share with other providers of televised, online and hard copy entertainment and content. Similarly, Expedia, our online travel-oriented business, faces significant competition from travel agencies (both bricks-and-mortar and online) as well as from travel destination sites and Internet search portals. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, accessibility, site functionality, reputation and credit availability, as well as the financial, technical and marketing expertise of competitors. For example, many of our businesses\u2019 competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers and greater brand recognition than our businesses do, and competitors may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, offer free or subsidized shipping and devote more resources to technology, fulfillment and marketing. For example, Bodybuilding.com competes with retailers such as GNC, and Backcountry.com competes with retailers such as REI, which have both online and bricks-and-mortar operations. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen\nI-24\ntheir competitive positions. If our subsidiaries and business affiliates do not compete effectively with regard to these factors, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe sales and operating results of the businesses attributed to each of our QVC Group and Ventures Group depend on their ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and predict or respond to consumer preferences. In an effort to attract and retain customers, these businesses engage in various merchandising and marketing initiatives, which involve the expenditure of money and resources. These initiatives, however, may not resonate with existing customers or consumers generally or may not be cost-effective. In addition, costs associated with the production and distribution of television programming (in the case of QVC and HSN) and costs associated with online marketing, including search engine marketing (primarily the purchase of relevant keywords) have increased and are likely to continue to increase in the foreseeable future and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect to the extent that they do not result in corresponding increases in net revenue. These companies also continuously develop new retail concepts and adjust their product mix in an effort to satisfy customer demands. Any sustained failure to identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could have a material adverse effect on the businesses of these subsidiaries and business affiliates. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of their control, including competition from store-based retailers, mail-order and third-party Internet companies, consumer confidence and preferences, and general economic conditions.\nThe failure of our subsidiary QVC and our business affiliate HSN to maintain suitable placement for their respective programming could adversely affect their ability to attract and retain television viewers and could result in a decrease in revenue. QVC and HSN are dependent upon the continued ability of their programming to compete for viewers. Effectively competing for television viewers is dependent, in substantial part, on their ability to negotiate and maintain placement of their programming at a favorable channel position, such as in a basic tier or within a general entertainment or general broadcasting tier. The advent of digital compression technologies and the adoption of digital cable have resulted in increased channel capacity, which together with other changing laws, rules and regulations regarding cable television ownership, impacts the ability of both QVC and HSN to negotiate and maintain suitable channel placement with their respective distributors. Increased channel capacity could adversely affect the ability to attract television viewers to QVC\u2019s or HSN\u2019s programming to the extent it results in a less favorable channel position for their respective programming, such as placement adjacent to programming that does not complement their respective programming, a position next to their respective televised home shopping competitors or isolation in a \"shopping\" tier, more competitors entering the marketplace, or more programming options being available to the viewing public in the form of new television networks and timeshifted viewing (e.g., personal video recorders, video-on-demand, interactive television and streaming video over Internet connections). In addition, if QVC\u2019s or HSN\u2019s programming is carried exclusively by a distributor on a digital programming tier, QVC or HSN may experience a reduction in revenue to the extent that the digital programming tier has less television viewer penetration than the basic or expanded basic programming tier. QVC and HSN may experience a further reduction in revenue due to increased television viewing audience fragmentation to the extent that not all television sets within a digital cable home are equipped to receive television programming in a digital format. The future success of each of QVC and HSN will depend, in part, on their ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer elements of their respective programming via new technologies in a cost-effective manner that meets customer demands and evolving industry standards.\nAny continued or permanent inability of QVC or HSN to transmit their programming via satellite would result in lost revenue and could result in lost customers. The success of our subsidiary QVC and our business affiliate HSN is dependent upon their continued ability to transmit their respective programming to television providers from their respective satellite uplink facilities, which transmissions are subject to FCC compliance in the U.S. and foreign regulatory\nI-25\nrequirements in QVC\u2019s and HSN\u2019s international operations. In most cases, each of QVC and HSN has entered into long-term satellite transponder leases to provide for continued carriage of its programming on replacement transponders and/or replacement satellites, as applicable, in the event of a failure of either the transponders and/or satellites currently carrying its programming. However, QVC does have transponder service agreements in the United Kingdom and Germany that will expire in 2015. Although QVC believes that it takes reasonable and customary measures to ensure continued satellite transmission capability and believes that these international transponder service agreements can be renewed (or replaced, if necessary) in the ordinary course of business, termination or interruption of satellite transmissions may occur, particularly if QVC is not able to successfully negotiate renewals or replacements of any of its expiring transponder service agreements in the future. Although QVC considers the transponder service agreements that are expiring in 2015 to be in the ordinary course, the failure to successfully renew or negotiate new transmission agreements that results in an inability to transmit its programming would result in lost revenue and could result in lost customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nSystem interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the systems and infrastructures of our subsidiary QVC, our business affiliate HSN and our other online commerce businesses may adversely affect their ability to, as applicable, operate their businesses, transmit their television programs, operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. The success of our subsidiaries and business affiliates depends, in part, on their ability to maintain the integrity of their transmissions, systems and infrastructures, including the transmission of television programs (in the case of QVC and HSN), as well as their websites, information and related systems, call centers and fulfillment facilities. These subsidiaries and business affiliates may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all transmissions, systems or data unavailable or prevent them from transmitting their signals or efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders, as the case may be. QVC is in the process of implementing new technology systems and upgrading others. The failure to properly implement new systems or delays in implementing new systems could impair the ability of our subsidiaries and business affiliates to provide services and content, fulfill orders and/or process transactions. QVC and HSN also rely on affiliate and third-party computer systems, broadband, transmission and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the transmission of their respective signals, as well as to facilitate, process and fulfill transactions. Any interruptions, outages or delays in their signal transmissions, systems and infrastructures, or any deterioration in the performance of these transmissions, systems and infrastructures, could impair their ability to provide services, fulfill orders and/or process transactions. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt television transmissions, computer, broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time. Any of these events could cause transmission or system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent our subsidiaries and business affiliates from providing services, fulfilling orders and/or processing transactions. While our subsidiaries and business affiliates have backup systems for certain aspects of their operations, these systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all possible risks. In addition, some of our subsidiaries and business affiliates may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.\nThe processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data by our home television and online commerce businesses could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights. In the processing of consumer transactions, home television and online commerce businesses receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information is governed by the privacy and data security policies maintained by these businesses. Moreover, there are federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data. Specifically, personally identifiable\nI-26\ninformation is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. The failure of these businesses and/or the failure by any of the various third party vendors and service providers with which they do business, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data, could damage their reputation and the reputation of their third party vendors and service providers, discourage potential users from trying their products and services and/or result in fines and/or proceedings brought by governmental agencies and/or consumers, any one or all of which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of these businesses and, as a result, our company.\nOur home television and online commerce businesses are subject to security risks, including security breaches and identity theft. In order to succeed, our home television and online commerce businesses must be able to provide for secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Any penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could cause interruptions in the operations of their business and subject them to increased costs, litigation and other liabilities. Security breaches could also significantly damage their reputation with their customers and third parties with whom they do business. These businesses may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any potential or existing security breaches and their consequences. They also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which they are affiliated or otherwise conduct business online. The loss of confidence in our online commerce businesses resulting from any such security breaches or identity theft could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our online commerce businesses and, as a result, our company.\nCertain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates may fail to adequately protect their intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. Our subsidiaries and business affiliates regard their respective intellectual property rights, including service marks, trademarks and domain names, copyrights (including their programming and their websites), trade secrets and similar intellectual property, as critical to their success. These businesses also rely heavily upon software codes, informational databases and other components that make up their products and services. From time to time, these businesses are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks, patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary to enforce the intellectual property rights of these businesses, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of these businesses and in turn our financial condition and results of operations. The failure of these businesses to protect their intellectual property rights, particularly their proprietary brands, in a meaningful manner or third party challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit the ability of these businesses to control marketing on or through the internet using their various domain names, which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of these businesses, as well as the financial condition and results of operations of our company.\nOur home television and online commerce businesses rely on independent shipping companies to deliver the products they sell. Our home television and online commerce businesses rely on third party carriers to deliver merchandise from vendors and manufacturers to them and to ship merchandise to their customers. As a result, they are subject to carrier disruptions and delays due to factors that are beyond their control, including employee strikes, inclement weather and regulation and enforcement actions by customs agencies. Any failure to deliver products to their customers in a timely and accurate manner may damage their reputation and brand and could cause them to lose customers. Enforcement actions\nI-27\nby customs agencies can also cause the costs of imported goods to increase, negatively affecting profits. These businesses are also impacted by increases in shipping rates charged by third party carriers, which over the past few years have increased significantly in comparison to historical levels, and it is currently expected that shipping and postal rates will continue to increase. In the case of deliveries to customers, in each market where we operate, we have negotiated agreements with one or more independent, third party shipping companies, which in certain circumstances provide for favorable shipping rates. If any of these relationships were to terminate or if a shipping company was unable to fulfill its obligations under its contract for any reason, these businesses would have to work with other shipping companies to deliver merchandise to customers, which would most likely be at less favorable rates. Other potential adverse consequences of changing carriers include reduced visibility of order status and package tracking, delays in order processing and product delivery, and reduced shipment quality, which may result in damaged products and customer dissatisfaction. Any increase in shipping rates and related fuel and other surcharges passed on to these business by their current carriers or any other shipping company would adversely impact profits, given that these businesses may not be able to pass these increased costs directly to customers or offset them by increasing prices without a detrimental effect on customer demand.\nThe seasonality of certain of our businesses places increased strain on their operations. The net revenue of our home television and online commerce businesses in recent years indicates that these businesses are seasonal due to a higher volume of sales in certain months or calendar quarters or related to particular holiday shopping. For example, in recent years, QVC has earned, on average, between 22% and 23% of its global revenue in each of the first three quarters of the year and 32% of its global revenue in the fourth quarter of the year. Similarly, our subsidiary Backcountry.com earns approximately 35% of its revenue in the fourth quarter, and our subsidiary Bodybuilding.com experiences a busier first quarter as people start to implement New Year\u2019s resolutions toward health and fitness. If the vendors for these businesses are not able to provide popular products in sufficient amounts such that these businesses fail to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect their revenue and future growth. If too many customers access the websites of these businesses within a short period of time due to increased demand, our businesses may experience system interruptions that make their websites unavailable or prevent them from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods they sell and the attractiveness of their products and services. In addition, they may be unable to adequately staff their fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other third party shipping (or carrier) companies may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. To the extent these businesses pay for holiday merchandise in advance of certain holidays (e.g., in the case of QVC, in August through November of each year), their available cash may decrease, resulting in less liquidity.\nThe failure of our subsidiary QVC to effectively manage its Easy-Pay and revolving credit card programs could result in less income. QVC offers Easy-Pay in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Italy (known as Q-Pay in Germany and Italy), a payment plan that, when offered by QVC, allows customers to pay for certain merchandise in two or more monthly installments. We cannot predict whether customers will pay all of their Easy-Pay installments. When the QVC Easy-Pay Plan is offered by QVC and elected by the customer, the first installment is typically billed to the customer\u2019s credit card upon shipment. Generally, the customer\u2019s credit card is subsequently billed up to five additional monthly installments until the total purchase price of the products has been billed by QVC. In addition, QVC-U.S. has an agreement with a large consumer financial institution (the \u201cBank\u201d) pursuant to which the Bank provides revolving credit directly to QVC\u2019s customers for the sole purpose of purchasing merchandise from QVC with a QVC branded credit card (\u201cQ Card\u201d). QVC receives a portion of the net economics of the credit card program according to percentages that vary with the performance of the portfolio. We cannot predict the extent to which QVC\u2019s customers will use the Q Card, nor the extent that they will make payments on their outstanding balances.\nI-28\nThe success of our home television and online commerce businesses depends in large part on their ability to recruit and retain key personnel capable of executing their unique business models. QVC and HSN, as well as our e-commerce subsidiaries have business models that require them to recruit and retain key employees, including management, with the skills necessary for a unique business that demands knowledge of the general retail industry, television production, direct to consumer marketing and fulfillment and the Internet. We cannot assure you that if QVC, HSN or our e-commerce subsidiaries experience turnover of these key employees they will be able to recruit and retain acceptable replacements because the market for such employees is very competitive and limited.\nCertain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates have operations outside of the United States that are subject to numerous operational and financial risks. Certain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates have operations in countries other than the United States that are subject to the following risks inherent in international operations:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles for sales in foreign countries that may increase the uncertainty associated with recoverable accounts;\n\u00b7\nrecessionary conditions and economic instability, including fiscal policies that are implementing austerity measures in certain countries, which are affecting overseas markets;\n\u00b7\nlimited ability to repatriate funds to the U.S. at favorable tax rates;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7\nexport and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u00b7\nincreases in taxes and governmental royalties and fees;\n\u00b7\nchanges in foreign and U.S. laws, regulations and policies that govern operations of foreign-based companies;\n\u00b7\nchanges to general consumer protection laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n\u00b7\nthreatened and actual terrorist attacks, political unrest in international markets and ongoing military action around the world that may result in disruptions of service that are critical to QVC\u2019s international businesses.\nMoreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in certain developing economies, it is not uncommon to encounter business practices that are prohibited by certain regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. Although certain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates have undertaken compliance efforts with respect to these laws, their respective employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which they outsource certain of their business operations, may take actions in violation of their policies and procedures. Any such violation, even if prohibited by the policies and procedures of these subsidiaries and business affiliates or the law, could have certain adverse effects on the financial condition of these subsidiaries and business affiliates. Any failure by these subsidiaries and business affiliates to effectively manage the challenges associated with the international operation of their businesses could materially adversely affect their, and hence our, financial condition.\nOur online commerce businesses, including QVC, HSN and Expedia could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or search engine disintermediation as well as their inability to monetize the resulting web traffic. The success of our online commerce businesses depends on a high degree of website traffic, which is dependent on many factors, including the availability of appealing website content, user loyalty and new user generation from search portals that charge a fee (such as Google). In obtaining a significant amount of website traffic via search engines, they utilize techniques such as search engine optimization, or SEO (which is the practice of developing websites with relevant and current content that rank well in \u201corganic,\u201d or unpaid, search engine results) and search engine marketing, or SEM (which is a form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages through the use of paid placement, contextual advertising, and paid inclusion) to improve\nI-29\ntheir placement in relevant search queries. Search engines, including Google, frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to the websites of our online commerce businesses can be negatively affected. Moreover, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing their websites to place lower in search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects their paid or unpaid search ranking, or if competitive dynamics impact the effectiveness of SEO or SEM in a negative manner, the business and financial performance of our online commerce businesses would be adversely affected, potentially to a material extent. Furthermore, the failure of our online commerce businesses to successfully manage their SEO and SEM strategies could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to their websites, as well as increased costs if they were to replace free traffic with paid traffic. Even if our online commerce businesses are successful in generating a high level of website traffic, no assurance can be given that our online commerce businesses will be successful in achieving repeat user loyalty or that new visitors will explore the offerings on their sites. Monetizing this traffic by converting users to consumers is dependent on many factors, including availability of inventory, consumer preferences, price, ease of use and website quality. No assurance can be given that the fees paid to search portals may exceed the revenue generated by their visitors. Any failure to sustain user traffic or to monetize such traffic could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our online commerce businesses and, as a result, adversely affect our financial results.\nOur online commerce businesses, including QVC, HSN and Expedia, may experience difficulty in achieving the successful development, implementation and customer acceptance of, and a viable advertising market via, applications for smartphone and tablet computing devices, which could harm their business. Although our online commerce businesses have developed services and applications to address user and consumer interaction with website content on smartphone and other non-traditional desktop or laptop computer systems (which typically have smaller screens and less convenient typing capabilities), the efficacy of the smartphone application and its advertising market is still developing. Moreover, if smartphone computing services prove to be less effective for the users of our online commerce businesses or less economically attractive for advertisers and the smartphone segment of Internet traffic grows at the expense of traditional computer and tablet Internet access, our online commerce businesses may experience difficulty attracting and retaining traffic and, in turn, advertisers, on these platforms. Additionally, as new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the challenges that may be encountered in developing versions of our online commerce businesses\u2019 offerings for use on these alternative devices, and our online commerce businesses may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of their services on such devices. To the extent that revenue generated from advertising placed on smartphone computing devices becomes increasingly more important to their businesses and they fail to adequately evolve and address this market, their business and financial performance could be negatively impacted. In addition, growth in the use of smartphone products as a substitute for use on personal computers and tablets may adversely impact revenue derived from advertising, as many of the processes used for smartphone advertising and related monetization strategies are still in development.\nOur subsidiary QVC has significant indebtedness, which could limit its flexibility to respond to current market conditions, restrict its business activities and adversely affect its financial condition. As of December 31, 2014, QVC had total debt of approximately $4.6 billion outstanding and an additional $1.5 billion available for borrowing under its senior secured credit facility as of that date. QVC may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. The indebtedness of QVC, combined with other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could among other things:\n\u00b7\nincrease QVC\u2019s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nrequire a substantial portion of QVC\u2019s cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness;\nI-30\n\u00b7\nlimit QVC\u2019s ability to use cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, which reduces the funds available to it for operations and any future business opportunities;\n\u00b7\nlimit flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the markets in which it operates;\n\u00b7\ncompetitively disadvantage QVC compared with competitors that have less debt;\n\u00b7\nlimit QVC\u2019s ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms that they find acceptable; and\n\u00b7\nexpose QVC to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of QVC\u2019s borrowings, including borrowings under its credit facility, are at variable interest rates.\nIn addition, it is possible that QVC may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. If new debt is added to its current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. If QVC experiences adverse effects on its financial condition as a result of its indebtedness, our financial performance could be adversely affected as well.\nWe do not have the right to manage our business affiliates attributed to either our QVC Group or our Ventures Group, which means we are not able to cause those affiliates to act in a manner that we deem desirable. We do not have the right to manage the businesses or affairs of any of our business affiliates (generally those companies in which we have less than a majority voting stake or with respect to which we have provided a proxy over our voting power to a third party) including Expedia, which is attributed to our Ventures Group, and HSN, which is attributed to our QVC Group. Rather, our rights may take the form of representation on the board of directors or a partners' or similar committee that supervises management or possession of veto rights over significant or extraordinary actions. The scope of our veto rights varies from agreement to agreement. Although our board representation and veto rights may enable us to exercise influence over the management or policies of a business affiliate, enable us to prevent the sale of material assets by a business affiliate in which we own less than a majority voting interest or prevent us from paying dividends or making distributions to our stockholders or partners, they will not enable us to cause these actions to be taken as these companies are business affiliates in which we own a partial interest.\nWe have overlapping directors and management with LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings and Liberty Broadband, which may lead to conflicting interests. As a result of the LMC Split-Off, the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off and LMC's spin-off of Liberty Broadband in November 2014, most of the executive officers of Liberty also serve as executive officers of LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings and Liberty Broadband, and there are overlapping directors. None of the foregoing companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and the members of our company\u2019s board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings or Liberty Broadband have fiduciary duties to that company\u2019s stockholders. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our company, LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings or Liberty Broadband looks at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Moreover, most of our company's directors and officers own LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings and Liberty Broadband stock and equity awards. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company, LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings and/or Liberty Broadband. Any potential conflict that qualifies as a \"related party transaction\" (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer's board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Each of Liberty Broadband and TripAdvisor Holdings has renounced its rights to certain\nI-31\nbusiness opportunities and each company\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions deeming directors and officers not in breach of their fiduciary duties in certain cases for directing a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings and Liberty Broadband) instead of such company. Any other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings or Liberty Broadband and/or their subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings, Liberty Broadband or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nThe liquidity and value of our public investments may be affected by market conditions beyond our control that could cause us to record losses for declines in their market value. Included among our assets are equity interests in publicly-traded companies that are not consolidated subsidiaries. The value of these interests may be affected by economic and market conditions that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to liquidate or otherwise monetize these interests without adversely affecting their value may be limited.\nA substantial portion of our consolidated debt attributed to each group is held above the operating subsidiary level, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service that debt and our other financial obligations. As of December 31, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary Liberty Interactive LLC (\u201cLiberty LLC\u201d) had $3,272 million principal amount of publicly-traded debt outstanding. Liberty LLC is a holding company for all of our subsidiaries and investments. Our ability to meet the financial obligations of Liberty LLC and our other financial obligations will depend on our ability to access cash. Our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from operating activities, dividends and interest from our investments, availability under credit facilities at the operating subsidiary level, monetization of our public investment portfolio and proceeds from asset sales. There are no assurances that we will maintain the amounts of cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities that we maintained over the past few years. The ability of our operating subsidiaries, including QVC, to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us or Liberty LLC depends on their individual operating results, any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject and the terms of their own indebtedness, including QVC\u2019s credit facility and bond indentures. The agreements governing such indebtedness restrict sales of assets and prohibit or limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions, loans or advances to stockholders and partners. Neither we nor Liberty LLC will generally receive cash, in the form of dividends, loans, advances or otherwise, from our business affiliates. See \u201c-We do not have the right to manage our business affiliates attributed to either our QVC Group or our Ventures Group, which means we are not able to cause those affiliates to act in a manner that we deem desirable\u201d above.\nWe have disposed of certain of the reference shares underlying the exchangeable debentures of Liberty LLC attributed to our Ventures Group, which exposes us to liquidity risk. Liberty LLC currently has outstanding multiple tranches of exchangeable debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $2,481 million as of December 31, 2014. Under the terms of these exchangeable debentures, which are attributed to our Ventures Group (other than the 1% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2043, which are attributed to the QVC Group), the holders may elect to require Liberty LLC to exchange the debentures for the value of a specified number of the underlying reference shares, which Liberty LLC may honor through delivery of reference shares, cash or a combination thereof. Also, Liberty LLC is required to distribute to the holders of its exchangeable debentures any cash, securities (other than publicly traded securities, which would themselves become reference shares) or other payments made by the issuer of the reference shares in respect of those shares. The principal amount of the debentures will be reduced by the amount of any such required distributions other than regular cash dividends. As Liberty LLC has disposed of some of the reference shares underlying certain of these exchangeable debentures, any exercise of the exchange right by, or required distribution of cash, securities or other payments to, holders of such debentures will require that Liberty LLC fund the required payments from its own resources,\nI-32\nwhich will depend on the availability of cash or other sources of liquidity to Liberty LLC at that time. Additionally, in the event all reference shares underlying a series of exchangeable debentures are liquidated or otherwise cease to be outstanding without replacement, there is a possibility that the treatment of tax matters associated with that series could change. This may include acceleration of tax liabilities that are recorded as deferred tax liabilities in our financial statements, in amounts that would be significant.\nRisks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock due to our Tracking Stock Capitalization\nHolders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock are common stockholders of our company and are, therefore, subject to risks associated with an investment in our company as a whole, even if a holder does not own shares of common stock of both of our groups. Even though we have attributed, for financial reporting purposes, all of our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows to either the QVC Group or the Ventures Group in order to prepare the separate financial statement schedules for each of those groups, we retain legal title to all of our assets and our capitalization does not limit our legal responsibility, or that of our subsidiaries, for the liabilities included in any set of financial statement schedules. Holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock do not have any legal rights related to specific assets attributed to the QVC Group or the Ventures Group and, in any liquidation, holders of QVC Group tracking stock and holders of Ventures Group tracking stock will be entitled to receive a pro rata share of our available net assets based on their respective numbers of liquidation units.\nOur board of directors' ability to reattribute businesses, assets and expenses between tracking stock groups may make it difficult to assess the future prospects of either tracking stock group based on its past performance. Our board of directors is vested with discretion to reattribute businesses, assets and liabilities that are attributed to one tracking stock group to the other tracking stock group, without the approval of any of our stockholders. For example, in October 2014, our board of directors approved the change in attribution from the QVC Group to the Ventures Group of certain Liberty online commerce subsidiaries and approximately $1 billion in cash, without stockholder approval. Any reattribution made by our board, as well as the existence of the right in and of itself to effect a reattribution, may impact the ability of investors to assess the future prospects of either tracking stock group, including its liquidity and capital resource needs, based on its past performance. Stockholders may also have difficulty evaluating the liquidity and capital resources of each group based on past performance, as our board of directors may use one group's liquidity to fund the other group's liquidity and capital expenditure requirements through the use of inter-group loans and inter-group interests.\nWe could be required to use assets attributed to one group to pay liabilities attributed to the other group. The assets attributed to one group are potentially subject to the liabilities attributed to the other group, even if those liabilities arise from lawsuits, contracts or indebtedness that are attributed to such other group. While our current management and allocation policies provide that reattributions of assets between groups will result in the creation of an inter-group loan or an inter-group interest or an offsetting reattribution of cash or other assets, no provision of our restated charter prevents us from satisfying liabilities of one group with assets of the other group, and our creditors are not in any way limited by our tracking stock capitalization from proceeding against any assets they could have proceeded against if we did not have a tracking stock capitalization.\nI-33\nThe market price of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock may not reflect the performance of the QVC Group and the Ventures Group, respectively, as we intend. We cannot assure you that the market price of the common stock of a group, in fact, will reflect the performance of the group of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to that group. Holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock are common stockholders of our company as a whole and, as such, will be subject to all risks associated with an investment in our company and all of our businesses, assets and liabilities. As a result, the market price of each series of stock of a group may simply reflect the performance of our company as a whole or may more independently reflect the performance of some or all of the group of assets attributed to such group. In addition, investors may discount the value of the stock of a group because it is part of a common enterprise rather than a stand-alone entity.\nThe market price of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock may be volatile, could fluctuate substantially and could be affected by factors that do not affect traditional common stock. The market prices of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock may be materially affected by, among other things:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in a group's operating results or in the operating results of particular companies attributable to such group;\n\u00b7\npotential acquisition activity by our company, our subsidiaries or our business affiliates;\n\u00b7\nissuances of debt or equity securities to raise capital by our company, our subsidiaries or our business affiliates and the manner in which that debt or the proceeds of an equity issuance are attributed to each of the groups;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts regarding QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock or the companies attributable to either of our tracking stock groups;\n\u00b7\nthe complex nature and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding the terms of both of our tracking stocks, as well as concerns regarding the possible effect of certain of those terms on an investment in our stock; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions.\nThe market value of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock could be adversely affected by events involving the assets and businesses attributed to either of the groups. Because we are the issuer of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock, an adverse market reaction to events relating to the assets and businesses attributed to either of our groups, such as earnings announcements or announcements of new products or services, acquisitions or dispositions that the market does not view favorably, may cause an adverse reaction to the common stock of our other group. This could occur even if the triggering event is not material to us as a whole. A certain triggering event may also have a greater impact on one group than the same triggering event would have on the other group due to the asset composition of the affected group. In addition, the incurrence of significant indebtedness by us or any of our subsidiaries on behalf of one group, including indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with acquisitions of or investments in businesses, could affect our credit rating and that of our subsidiaries and, therefore, could increase the borrowing costs of businesses attributable to our other group or the borrowing costs of our company as a whole.\nWe may not pay dividends equally or at all on QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock. We do not presently intend to pay cash dividends on QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock for the foreseeable future. However, we will have the right to pay dividends on the shares of common stock of each group in equal or unequal amounts, and we may pay dividends on the shares of common stock of one group and not pay dividends on\nI-34\nshares of common stock of the other group. In addition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, shares relating to either group will reduce our assets legally available to be paid as dividends on the shares relating to the other group.\nOur tracking stock capital structure could create conflicts of interest, and our board of directors may make decisions that could adversely affect only some holders of our common stock. Our tracking stock capital structure could give rise to occasions when the interests of holders of stock of one group might diverge or appear to diverge from the interests of holders of stock of the other group. In addition, given the nature of their businesses, there may be inherent conflicts of interests between the QVC Group and the Ventures Group. Our tracking stock groups are not separate entities and thus holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock do not have the right to elect separate boards of directors. As a result, our company's officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to our company as a whole and all of our stockholders as opposed to only holders of a particular group. Decisions deemed to be in the best interest of our company and all of our stockholders may not be in the best interest of a particular group when considered independently. Examples include:\n\u00b7\ndecisions as to the terms of any business relationships that may be created between the QVC Group and the Ventures Group or the terms of any reattributions of assets or liabilities between the groups;\n\u00b7\ndecisions as to the allocation of consideration among the holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock, or among the series of stocks relating to either of our groups, to be received in connection with a merger involving our company;\n\u00b7\ndecisions as to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the groups, especially where the opportunities might meet the strategic business objectives of both groups;\n\u00b7\ndecisions as to operational and financial matters that could be considered detrimental to one group but beneficial to the other;\n\u00b7\ndecisions as to the conversion of shares of common stock of one group into shares of common stock of the other;\n\u00b7\ndecisions regarding the creation of, and, if created, the subsequent increase or decrease of any inter-group interest that one group may own in the other group;\n\u00b7\ndecisions as to the internal or external financing attributable to businesses or assets attributed to either of our groups;\n\u00b7\ndecisions as to the dispositions of assets of either of our groups; and\n\u00b7\ndecisions as to the payment of dividends on the stock relating to either of our groups.\nOur directors' or officers' ownership of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock may create or appear to create conflicts of interest. If directors or officers own disproportionate interests (in percentage or value terms) in QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock, that disparity could create or appear to create conflicts of interest when they are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the holders of QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock.\nOther than pursuant to our management and allocation policies, we have not adopted any specific procedures for consideration of matters involving a divergence of interests among holders of shares of stock relating to our two groups, or among holders of different series of stock relating to a specific group. Rather than develop additional specific procedures in advance, our board of directors intends to exercise its judgment from time to time, depending on the circumstances, as to how best to:\n\u00b7\nobtain information regarding the divergence (or potential divergence) of interests;\nI-35\n\u00b7\ndetermine under what circumstances to seek the assistance of outside advisers;\n\u00b7\ndetermine whether a committee of our board of directors should be appointed to address a specific matter and the appropriate members of that committee; and\n\u00b7\nassess what is in our best interests and the best interests of all of our stockholders.\nOur board of directors believes the advantage of retaining flexibility in determining how to fulfill its responsibilities in any such circumstances as they may arise outweighs any perceived advantages of adopting additional specific procedures in advance.\nOur board of directors may change the management and allocation policies to the detriment of either group without stockholder approval. Our board of directors has adopted certain management and allocation policies to serve as guidelines in making decisions regarding the relationships between the QVC Group and the Ventures Group with respect to matters such as tax liabilities and benefits, inter-group loans, inter-group interests, attribution of assets, financing alternatives, corporate opportunities and similar items. These policies also set forth the initial focuses and strategies of these groups and the initial attribution of our businesses, assets and liabilities between them. These policies are not included in the restated charter. Our board of directors may at any time change or make exceptions to these policies. Because these policies relate to matters concerning the day-to-day management of our company as opposed to significant corporate actions, such as a merger involving our company or a sale of substantially all of our assets, no stockholder approval is required with respect to their adoption or amendment. A decision to change, or make exceptions to, these policies or adopt additional policies could disadvantage one group while advantaging the other.\nHolders of shares of stock relating to a particular group may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that stock, or on a particular series of that stock. Principles of Delaware law and the provisions of our restated charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of shares of stock relating to a particular group, or upon holders of any series of stock relating to a particular group. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, regardless of the stock, or series, they hold. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all stockholders and does not have separate or additional duties to any subset of stockholders. Judicial opinions in Delaware involving tracking stocks have established that decisions by directors or officers involving differing treatment of holders of tracking stocks may be judged under the \u201cbusiness judgment rule.\u201d In some circumstances, our directors or officers may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of shares relating to a particular group or to the holders of a particular series of that stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule referred to above, you may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that you believe have a disparate impact upon the stockholders of one of our groups if a majority of our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of Liberty and all of our stockholders.\nStockholders will not vote on how to attribute consideration received in connection with a merger involving our company among holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock. Our restated charter does not contain any provisions governing how consideration received in connection with a merger or consolidation involving our company is to be attributed to the holders of QVC Group tracking stock and holders of Ventures Group tracking stock or to the holders of different series of stock, and none of the holders of QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock will have a separate class vote in the event of such a merger or consolidation. Consistent with applicable principles of Delaware law, our board of directors will seek to divide the type and amount of consideration received in a merger or consolidation involving our company among holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking\nI-36\nstock in a fair manner. As the different ways the board of directors may divide the consideration between holders of stock relating to the different groups, and among holders of different series of a particular stock, might have materially different results, the consideration to be received by holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock in any such merger or consolidation may be materially less valuable than the consideration they would have received if they had a separate class vote on such merger or consolidation.\nWe may dispose of assets of the QVC Group or the Ventures Group without your approval. Delaware law requires stockholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of our company taken as a whole, and our restated charter does not require a separate class vote in the case of a sale of a significant amount of assets of any of our groups. As long as the assets attributed to the QVC Group or the Ventures Group proposed to be disposed of represent less than substantially all of our assets, we may approve sales and other dispositions of any amount of the assets of such group without any stockholder approval.\nIf we dispose of all or substantially all of the assets attributed to any group (which means, for this purpose, assets representing 80% of the fair market value of the total assets of the disposing group, as determined by our board of directors), we would be required, if the disposition is not an exempt disposition under the terms of our restated charter, to choose one or more of the following three alternatives:\n\u00b7\ndeclare and pay a dividend on the disposing group's common stock;\n\u00b7\nredeem shares of the disposing group's common stock in exchange for cash, securities or other property; and/or\n\u00b7\nconvert all or a portion of the disposing group's outstanding common stock into common stock of the other group.\nIn this type of a transaction, holders of the disposing group's common stock may receive less value than the value that a third-party buyer might pay for all or substantially all of the assets of the disposing group.\nOur board of directors will decide, in its sole discretion, how to proceed and is not required to select the option that would result in the highest value to holders of any group of our common stock.\nHolders of QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of the assets attributed to that group than if that group were a separate company. If the QVC Group or the Ventures Group were a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, certain costs of that sale, including corporate level taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result, stockholders of a separate, independent company with the same assets might receive a greater amount of proceeds than the holders of QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock would receive upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the group to which their shares relate. In addition, we cannot assure you that in the event of such a sale the per share consideration to be paid to holders of QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock, as the case may be, will be equal to or more than the per share value of that share of stock prior to or after the announcement of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the applicable group. Further, there is no requirement that the consideration paid be tax-free to the holders of the shares of common stock of that group. Accordingly, if we sell all or substantially all of the assets attributed to the QVC Group or the Ventures Group, our stockholders could suffer a loss in the value of their investment in our company.\nIn the event of a liquidation of Liberty, holders of Ventures Group tracking stock and QVC Group tracking stock will not have a priority with respect to the assets attributed to the related tracking stock group remaining for distribution to stockholders. Under the restated charter, upon Liberty's liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of the Ventures\nI-37\nGroup tracking stock and the QVC Group tracking stock will be entitled to receive, in respect of their shares of such stock, their proportionate interest in all of Liberty's assets, if any, remaining for distribution to holders of common stock in proportion to their respective number of \"liquidation units\" per share. Relative liquidation units were determined based on the volume weighted average prices of the Ventures Group tracking stock and the QVC Group tracking stock over the 20 trading day period which commenced shortly after the initial filing of the restated charter. Hence, the assets to be distributed to a holder of either tracking stock upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Liberty will have nothing to do with the value of the assets attributed to the related tracking stock group or to changes in the relative value of the QVC Group tracking stock and the Ventures Group tracking stock over time.\nOur board of directors may in its sole discretion elect to convert the common stock relating to one group into common stock relating to the other group, thereby changing the nature of your investment and possibly diluting your economic interest in our company, which could result in a loss in value to you. Our restated charter permits our board of directors, in its sole discretion, to convert all of the outstanding shares of common stock relating to either of our groups into shares of common stock of the other group on specified terms. A conversion would preclude the holders of stock in each group involved in such conversion from retaining their investment in a security that is intended to reflect separately the performance of the relevant group. We cannot predict the impact on the market value of our stock of (1) our board of directors' ability to effect any such conversion or (2) the exercise of this conversion right by our company. In addition, our board of directors may effect such a conversion at a time when the market value of our stock could cause the stockholders of one group to be disadvantaged.\nHolders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock will vote together and will have limited separate voting rights. Holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock will vote together as a single class, except in certain limited circumstances prescribed by our restated charter and under Delaware law. Each share of Series B common stock of each group has ten votes per share, and each share of Series A common stock of each group has one vote per share. Holders of Series C common stock of each group have no voting rights, other than those required under Delaware law. When holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock vote together as a single class, holders having a majority of the votes will be in a position to control the outcome of the vote even if the matter involves a conflict of interest among our stockholders or has a greater impact on one group than the other.\nTransactions in our common stock by our insiders could depress the market price of our common stock. Sales of or hedging transactions such as collars relating to our shares by our Chairman of the Board or any of our other directors or executive officers could cause a perception in the marketplace that our stock price has peaked or that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at our company. This perception can result notwithstanding any personal financial motivation for these insider transactions. As a result, insider transactions could depress the market price for shares of one or more series of our tracking stocks.\nOur capital structure, as well as the fact that the QVC Group and the Ventures Group are not independent companies, may inhibit or prevent acquisition bids for the QVC Group or the Ventures Group and may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders. If the QVC Group and the Ventures Group were separate independent companies, any person interested in acquiring the QVC Group or the Ventures Group without negotiating with management could seek control of that group by obtaining control of its outstanding voting stock, by means of a tender offer, or by means of a proxy contest. Although we intend QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock to reflect the separate economic performance of the QVC Group and the Ventures Group, respectively, those groups are not separate entities and a person interested in acquiring only one group without negotiation with our management could obtain control of that group only by obtaining control of a majority in voting power of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of our company. The existence of shares of common stock, and different series of\nI-38\nshares, relating to different groups could present complexities and in certain circumstances pose obstacles, financial and otherwise, to an acquiring person that are not present in companies that do not have capital structures similar to ours.\nCertain provisions of our restated charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock, a Series B common stock of each group that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A common stock of each group that entitles the holder to one vote per share, and a Series C common stock of each group that except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holder to no voting rights;\n\u00b7\nclassifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nrequiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our aggregate voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our restated charter; and\n\u00b7\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock, including \"blank check\" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to persons friendly to our then current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of our company.\nOur chairman, John C. Malone, beneficially owns shares representing the power to direct approximately 37% of the aggregate voting power in our company, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 94% and 94% of the outstanding shares of each of our Series B Liberty Interactive common stock and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock, respectively, as of January 31, 2015.", "PERMNO": 91278, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "QRTEA"}
