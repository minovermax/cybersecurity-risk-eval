{"cik": "1585364", "company": "PERRIGO Co plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Operations\nIf we do not continue to rapidly develop, manufacture and market innovative products that meet customer demands, we may lose market share and our net sales may be negatively impacted.\nOur continued growth is due in large part to our ability to rapidly develop, manufacture, and market products that meet customer requirements for performance, safety, and cost effectiveness. Continuous introductions of new products and product categories are critical to our business. If we do not continue to develop, manufacture, and market new products, we could lose market share, and our net sales may be negatively impaired. See Item 1. Business - Research and Development for more information.\n\u2022\nWe maintain a diversified product line to function as a primary supplier for our customers. Capital investments are driven by growth, technological advancements, cost improvement and the need for manufacturing flexibility. Our estimates of future capital expenditures could vary materially due to the uncertainty of these factors. In addition, if we fail to stay current with the latest manufacturing, information and packaging technology, we may be unable to competitively support the launch of new product introductions.\n\u2022\nOur product margins may decline over time due to our products' aging life cycles, changes in consumer choice, or developments in new drug delivery technology; therefore, new product introductions are necessary to maintain our current financial condition. If we are unable to continue to create new products, we may lose market share and our net sales may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nWe must prove that the ANDA drug products our CHC and Rx Pharmaceuticals segments produce are bioequivalent to their branded counterparts, which requires bioequivalency studies, and in the case of topical products, even more extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy. The development and commercialization process, particularly with respect to innovative products, is both time consuming and costly and involves a high degree of business risk. Products currently under development, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as expected, may not pass required bioequivalence studies or may be the subject of intellectual property challenges. Necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all, and we may not be able to successfully and profitably produce and market such products. This could negatively impact our net sales.\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract and retain scientists proficient in emerging delivery forms and/or contracting with a third party in order to generate new products of this type is critical to our long-term plans. If we fail to attract and retain this talent, our long term sales growth and profit could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nEven upon the successful development of a product, our customer's failure to launch a product successfully could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the FDA or similar regulatory agency could impose higher standards and additional requirements, such as requiring more supporting data and clinical data than previously required, in order to gain regulatory clearance to launch new formulations into the market.\n\u2022\nWe contract with clinical research organizationss (\"CROs\") to conduct various studies that are used to support our new product development program. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, certain of these CROs began bankruptcy or receivership proceedings, including PRACS Institute, LLC, PRACS Institute Canada B.C. Ltd., Comprehensive Clinical Development, Inc., and their related entities. It is uncertain what impact these insolvency proceedings may have on their ability to deliver their study results to us or on our ability to rely on their research. To the extent these CROs cannot deliver their study results to us or we cannot rely, in whole or in part, on the research conducted by them, we may be required to delay the launch of new products, which could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results. The FDA may be limited in its ability to inspect CROs' study facilities or to gain access to source study documents, which may result in us having to repeat biostudies. If these scenarios occur, it could result in approval delays for new products, which could adversely impact our future net sales. These situations are unique, and we are unable to predict the FDA's position on the studies conducted by these now bankrupt CROs.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nOur CHC and BCH segments are impacted by changes in consumer preferences. If we are unable to adapt to these changes, we may lose market share and our net sales may be negatively impacted.\nWhile the market for store brand products has grown in recent years, there can be no assurance that the growth will continue. Additionally, consumer preferences related to health and nutritional concerns may change, which could negatively impact demand for our CHC and BCH products or cause us to incur additional costs to change our products or product packaging.\n\u2022\nThe future growth and stability of U.S. store brand market share will be impacted, in part, by general economic conditions, which can influence consumers to switch to and from store brand products. Our CHC segment sales could be negatively affected if economic conditions improve and consumers return to purchasing higher-priced brand-name products. Conversely, while store brand products present an alternative to higher-priced branded products, if economic conditions deteriorate, our CHC segment sales could be negatively impacted if consumers forgo obtaining healthcare or reduce their healthcare spending.\n\u2022\nOur BCH segment's success is due in large part to the continued growth in demand for its lifestyle products, which include weight-loss products and various dietary supplements. If demand for these products decreases, our BCH segment's results of operations would be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nOur CHC customers may request changes in packaging to meet consumer demands, which could cause us to incur inventory obsolescence charges and redesign costs, which would negatively impact the CHC segment's results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur infant formula product category within our CHC segment is subject to changing consumer preferences and health and nutrition-related concerns. Our business depends, in part, on consumer preferences and choices, including the number of mothers who choose to use infant formula products rather than breastfeed their babies. To the extent that private, public, and government sources may promote the benefits of breastfeeding over the use of infant formula, there could be a reduced demand for infant formula products. We could also be adversely impacted by an increase in the number of families that are provided with infant formula by the U.S. federal government through the Women, Infants and Children program, as we do not participate in this program.\nWe face risks associated with the successful integration of our recently-acquired Omega business.\nAs described in Item 1. Business - Major Recent Developments, we closed on the Omega acquisition on March 30, 2015. In addition to the risks mentioned under \"We may not realize the benefits of business acquisitions and divestitures we enter into, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results\", the Omega acquisition exposes us to a number of additional business, financial, and competitive risks, including:\n\u2022\nThe Omega acquisition represents a major shift in our business, both geographically, as our business is now more heavily concentrated in European markets than before, and operationally, as the Omega business sells well-known branded products using a large sales force. These changes may present challenges and risks related to, among other things, our attempt to create synergies with Omega. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate Omega or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the Omega acquisition.\n\u2022\nOur success in the European markets in which Omega operates will depend on a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nour ability to commercialize new products;\n\u2022\nour ability to adapt to changes in economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates;\n\u2022\ncompliance with differing regulatory and legal requirements, including tax laws, trade laws, labor, safety, local content, consumer protection regulation and import or export licensing requirements; and\n\u2022\nconsistency and transparency of foreign tax systems, transfer pricing stability across jurisdictions, and our ability to reinvest earnings and cash as appropriate.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased net sales and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, any or all of which could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWhile Omega has not historically been subject to U.S. laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, it has been subject to a wide range of European laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. The comparable U.S. laws and regulations to which Omega is now subject may differ from those to which Omega was historically subject. Therefore, it is possible that certain Omega sales or other activities that were permitted while Omega was an independent company may no longer be permitted. While we are putting into place compliance processes and controls intended to ensure compliance with U.S. and global laws that now apply to Omega, if Omega\u2019s operations fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be subject to governmental investigations, legal or regulatory proceedings, substantial fines, and/or other legal or equitable penalties.\nWe have been the subject of unsolicited interest from Mylan, which has been, and may continue to be, a distraction to our management and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.\nThe pharmaceutical industry has been intensely acquisitive over the past several years. Mylan has made several unsolicited offers to purchase all of our outstanding ordinary shares as described in detail below. The uncertainty regarding Mylan\u2019s future actions or further pursuit of a revised proposal or offer may be disruptive to our business, which could have a negative effect on our operations, financial condition, or results of operations.\nSince April 2015, Mylan has made several unsolicited offers to purchase all of our outstanding ordinary shares as described below:\n\u2022\nApril 6, 2015 - Mylan sent a letter containing an unsolicited proposal to acquire all of our outstanding ordinary shares for $205.00 per share (the \"Proposal\"), which Mylan made public on April 8, 2015. Following a comprehensive review, our Board of Directors unanimously rejected the Proposal, concluding that it substantially undervalued us and our future growth prospects and was not in the best interests of our shareholders.\n\u2022\nPrior to making the Proposal, Mylan was the subject of market speculation related to a possible offer to purchase Mylan from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (\"Teva\"). On April 21, 2015, Teva announced an unsolicited proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Mylan for $82.00 per share, with the consideration to be comprised of approximately 50% cash and 50% stock. On April 27, 2015, Mylan announced that its Board of Directors had rejected the proposal, following which Teva reiterated its commitment to its proposal.\n\u2022\nApril 24, 2015 - Mylan provided a firm offer to acquire all of our outstanding ordinary shares for a combination of $60.00 per share in cash and 2.2 Mylan ordinary shares for each of our ordinary shares (the \u201cOffer\u201d). That same day, we announced our Board of Directors' rejection of the Offer, for the same reasons we rejected the Proposal.\n\u2022\nApril 29, 2015 - Mylan announced a revised offer to acquire all of our outstanding ordinary shares for $75.00 per share in cash and 2.3 Mylan ordinary shares for each of our ordinary shares (the \u201cRevised Offer\u201d). That same day, we announced our Board of Directors' rejection of the Revised Offer. Since our rejection of the Revised Offer from Mylan, no further offers have been made. However, Mylan reiterated its proposal to acquire us on the terms of the Revised Offer in its proxy statement filed on July 28, 2015. Additionally, on July 27, 2015, Mylan announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders on August 28, 2015 in connection with its proposed acquisition of us.\n\u2022\nOn July 27, 2015, Teva announced that it had withdrawn its proposal to acquire Mylan. Teva\u2019s decision to terminate its proposal to acquire Mylan followed Teva\u2019s announcement that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Allergan to acquire Allergan Generics.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nOn August 13, 2015, Mylan announced that it formally lowered the acceptance condition for its offer to acquire Perrigo from not less than 80% of Perrigo ordinary shares to greater than 50% of Perrigo ordinary shares.\nResponding to the Proposal, Offer, and Revised Offer has been, and may continue to be, a distraction for certain of our management and employees, and has required, and may continue to require, us to incur additional expenses and costs. Since the announcement of the offer, we have incurred $13.4 million in related fees. Management and employee distraction related to Mylan's unsolicited interest also may adversely impact our ability to optimally conduct our business and pursue our strategic objectives. Further, we are deemed to be in an \"offer period\" for the purposes of the Irish Takeover Rules, which may restrict our ability to execute our strategy on a timely basis.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and any inability to timely meet current or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nWe are subject to the regulations of a variety of U.S. and non-U.S. agencies related to the manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distribution, advertising, and sale of our products as described in detail in Item 1. Business - Government Regulation and Pricing. Government regulation in the markets in which we operate could impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies. Below are some of the ways in which government regulation could impact our business and/or financial results:\n\u2022\nWe must obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory agencies in order to manufacture and sell our products in the regions in which we operate. Obtaining this approval can be time consuming and costly. There can be no assurance that, in the event we submit an application to the FDA or any other regulatory agency approval, we will obtain the approval to market a prescription or OTC product and/or that we will obtain it on a timely basis. If we are granted generic exclusivity, the exclusivity may be shared with other generic companies, including authorized generics; or it is possible that we may forfeit 180-day exclusivity if we do not obtain regulatory approval or begin marketing the product within the statutory requirements. Finally, if we are not the first to file our ANDA, the FDA may grant 180-day exclusivity to another company, thereby effectively delaying the launch of our product.\n\u2022\nIf the FDA reclassifies certain ANDA or NDA drug products to the OTC monograph system and no longer requires the approval of an ANDA or NDA prior to marketing, there may be increased competition and lower profitability related to such products. While we would make appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance with any changes and updates to the OTC monograph system, we cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted, the effect of any such legislation on our business, or how it may impact the competitive landscape. See Item 1. Business - Consumer Healthcare for more information on the OTC monograph system.\n\u2022\nRegulatory agencies regularly inspect our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of our third-party suppliers. The failure of one of our facilities, or a facility of one of our third-party suppliers, to comply with applicable laws and regulations may lead to a breach of representations made to our customers, or to regulatory or government action against us related to the products made in that facility. Such action could include: suspension of or delay in regulatory approvals, product seizure, injunction, recall, suspension of production or distribution of our products, loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties, civil or criminal prosecution. Additionally, the agency could make its concerns public, thereby impacting our reputation.\n\u2022\nThe FDA, and similar regulatory agencies, have the authority to require new clinical or bioequivalence studies, limit distribution, or order label changes. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals if there are concerns over a product's safety or efficacy. The FDA also conducts non-prescription drug advisory committee meetings to evaluate the safety of introducing prescription products to the OTC market. The expansion of Rx-to-OTC switches is critical to our future growth. FDA reluctance to approve OTC switches in new product categories could impact that growth.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nThe U.S. government Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (\"DSCSA\") requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period. The serialization of all Rx products distributed in the U.S. needs to be completed by November 27, 2017, with the requirement for tracking the products commencing on November 27, 2023. Requirements for the tracing of products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain go into effect on January 1, 2015, for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and re-packagers, and on July 1, 2015 for dispensers. Compliance with DSCSA and future U.S. federal or state electronic pedigree requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens.\n\u2022\nSeveral bills have been introduced in U.S. Congress that could, if enacted, affect the manufacture and marketing of Rx and OTC drugs including labeling and packaging. For example, the FDA is proposing to change existing regulations to require generic drug application holders to revise their labeling so that it differs from the corresponding brand drug upon submission of a \"changes being effected\" (\"CBE-0\") supplement to the FDA. The FDA has not yet issued a final rule on this issue. If this proposed regulatory change is adopted, it may eliminate the preemption of certain failure-to-warn claims, with respect to generic drugs, which could have an adverse impact on our future operating results. Regulatory bodies outside of the U.S. could enact similar legislation. We cannot predict whether further label restrictions may be required, or whether additional regulations in the U.S. or other countries in which we operate, may be passed.\n\u2022\nOur infant formula products may be subject to barriers or sanctions imposed by countries or international organizations limiting international trade and dictating the specific content of infant formula products. Governments could enhance regulations on the industry aimed at ensuring the safety and quality of dairy products, including, but not limited to, compulsory batch-by-batch inspection and testing for additional safety and quality issues. Such inspections and testing may increase our operating costs related to infant formula products. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory agencies are beginning to scrutinize claims on infant formula labels. Any labeling changes required for regulatory compliance could render our packaging inventories obsolete.\n\u2022\nOn June 10, 2014, the FDA published a final rule (\"FR\") entitled \"Current Good Manufacturing Practices, Quality Control Procedures, Quality Factors, Notification Requirements, and Records and Reports, for Infant Formula.\" The FR includes, among other things, new or modified requirements related to infant formula manufacturing, quality controls, record-keeping, and clinical trials. While it is uncertain how the FDA will interpret and enforce the FR, we are taking steps to comply with the provisions of the FR. Compliance with the FR could be costly. To the extent the FDA believes that we have not complied with the FR, we could experience potential supply chain disruptions and delays in commercialization of new infant formula products.\n\u2022\nWe have expanded our pharmaceutical marketing to include direct interactions with healthcare professionals, which is known as \u201cdetailing.\u201d This activity is subject to extensive regulation under a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including anti-kickback, anti-bribery and false claims laws; the FFDCA with respect to claims and off-label promotions; and similar laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions. If our marketing activities are found to be improper, we could be subject to civil and governmental actions and penalties. These risks may increase as non-U.S. jurisdictions adopt new anti-bribery laws and regulations.\n\u2022\nWe manufacture products that are safe and effective when used in accordance with label directions. Certain of our products contain ingredients that can be used for improper purposes. Additional legislation or regulation may be enacted to mitigate improper uses of these ingredients, which could adversely impact our sales of products containing these ingredients and the corresponding income.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to successfully obtain the necessary quota for controlled substances and List I chemicals, we risk having delayed product launches or failures to meet commercial supply obligations. If we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements for controlled substances and List I chemicals, the DEA, or similar regulatory agency, may take regulatory actions, resulting in temporary or permanent interruption of distribution of our products, withdrawal of our products from the market, or other penalties.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nOur prescription products that are marketed without approved applications must meet certain manufacturing and labeling standards established by the FDA. The FDA takes a risk-based approach to its enforcement and considers factors such as the introduction date of the product's active ingredients, lack of safety concerns, and how many years the product has been marketed. There can be no assurance that the FDA will continue this policy or not take a contrary position with respect to any individual product or group of products. If the FDA were to take a contrary position, we may be required to seek FDA approval for these products or withdraw the products from the market. Our annual sales for such unapproved products were approximately $46.5 million in fiscal year 2015.\n\u2022\nIn addition, our operations extend to numerous countries outside the U.S. and are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations, and customs of various jurisdictions. These risks include compliance with a variety of national and local laws of countries in which we do business, such as restrictions on the import and export of certain intermediates, drugs, and technologies. We must also comply with a variety of U.S. laws related to doing business outside of the U.S., including Office of Foreign Asset Controls, United Nations and EU sanctions; the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012; and rules relating to the use of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Further changes in laws, regulations, and practices affecting the pharmaceutical industry and the healthcare system, including imports, exports, manufacturing, quality, cost, pricing, reimbursement, approval, inspection, and delivery of healthcare may affect our business and operations.\nHealthcare reform and related changes to reimbursement methods in and outside of the United States may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing healthcare expenditures have received considerable public attention in many of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private insurers have been focused on cost containment. In the EU and some other markets outside the U.S., the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Both private and governmental entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs.\nOur Rx Pharmaceutical segment in particular could be adversely impacted by measures taken by governmental entities or private insurers to restrict patients' access to our products or increase pressure on drug pricing, including denial of price increases, prospective and retrospective price decreases, and increased mandatory discounts or rebates. These actions may drive us and our competitors to decrease prices or may reduce the ability of customers to pay for our products, which could negatively impact the Rx Pharmaceutical segment's results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program or other governmental purchasing and rebate programs, we could be subject to fines or penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs described in Item 1. Business - Medicaid Drug Rebate Programs, we have a Medicaid rebate agreement in effect with the U.S. government. There are inherent risks associated with participating in the Medicaid drug rebate program including the following:\n\u2022\nWe are required to report pricing data to CMS on a monthly basis. If we fail to submit required information, make misrepresentations, or knowingly submit false information to the government as to AMP, ASP, or BP, we may be liable for substantial civil monetary penalties or subject to other enforcement actions, such as under the False Claims Act, and CMS may terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement. In that event, U.S. federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.\n\u2022\nHealth reform legislation enacted in 2010 requires the use of AMP data to calculate FULs and amends the statutory definitions of AMP and \"multiple source drug\" in a manner that materially affects the calculation of FULs. CMS also has begun surveying and publishing retail community pharmacy acquisition cost and consumer price information to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis for comparing their own\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nreimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. We do not know how the new methodologies for calculating AMP and FULs or the retail survey acquisition cost and consumer price information will affect our pharmacy customers or to what extent these customers will seek to pass on any decrease in Medicaid reimbursements to us. We also cannot predict how the sharing of FUL data and retail survey prices may impact competition in the marketplace.\n\u2022\nIf we inadvertently overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or Section 703 Agreement, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we are required to refund the difference. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in False Claims Act allegations or potential violations of other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responses to a government investigation or enforcement action, are expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n\u2022\nOur reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Our calculations and methodologies are subject to review by the governmental agencies, and it is possible that these reviews could result in challenges to our submissions. If we do not comply with those reporting and payment obligations, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties, and possible exclusion from U.S. federal healthcare programs (including Medicaid and Medicare).\n\u2022\nIn June 2013, we received notices from the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Texas of civil investigative demands for two of our affiliates, Perrigo Pharmaceuticals Company and Paddock Laboratories, LLC (\"Paddock\"). The notices request information under the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act relating to the submission of prices to Texas Medicaid in claims for reimbursement for drugs. We have cooperated with requests for information and are in the process of evaluating this and other information. While we do not know the full extent of our potential liability at this time and intend to vigorously defend against any claims, we could be subject to material penalties and damages. See Item 8. Note 15 for further information.\nWe face vigorous competition from other pharmaceutical companies that may threaten the commercial acceptance and pricing of our products.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete against store brand, generic, and branded pharmaceutical companies. Competition is also impacted by changes in regulations and government pricing programs that may give competitors an advantage.\n\u2022\nAs a manufacturer of generic versions of brand-name drugs through our CHC and Rx segments, we experience competition from brand-name drug companies that may try to prevent, discourage or delay the use of generic versions through various measures, including introduction of new branded products, legislative initiatives, changing dosage forms or dosing regimens, regulatory processes, filing new patents or patent extensions, lawsuits, citizens\u2019 petitions, and negative publicity prior to introduction of a generic product. In addition, brand-name competitors may lower their prices to compete with generic products, increase advertising, or launch, either through an affiliate or licensing arrangements with another company, or an authorized generic at or near the time the first generic product is launched, depriving the generic product market of the exclusivity intended by the Hatch-Waxman Act.\n\u2022\nOur CHC and Rx Pharmaceuticals segments also experience competition from our generic competitors, some of whom are significantly larger than we are, may develop their products more rapidly or complete regulatory approval processes sooner, or may market their products earlier than we do. If we are not the first to file our ANDA, the FDA may grant 180-day exclusivity to another company, which would prevent us from selling the product during the exclusivity period. Even if we are the first to file, in certain circumstances, we may not be able to fully exploit our 180-day exclusivity period.\n\u2022\nAdditionally, our CHC and Rx Pharmaceuticals segments may experience increased price competition as other generic companies produce the same product or introduce new drugs and/or drug delivery techniques that make our current products less desirable. A drug may be subject to competition from alternative\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\ntherapies during the period of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity, and thereafter we may be subject to further competition from generic products or biosimilars.\n\u2022\nThe pharmaceutical industry is consolidating. This creates larger competitors and places further pressure on prices, development activities, and customer retention. Our animal health category within the CHC segment also has seen a dramatic increase in direct to consumer advertising by several branded competitors, and our nutritionals category has experienced increased competition through alternative channels such as health food stores, direct mail, and direct sales.\n\u2022\nWe develop and distribute branded products through our BCH segment. We experience competition from other brand-name drug companies, many of which are larger and have more resources to devote to advertising and marketing. These direct competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements. Our current and future competitors may develop products comparable or superior to those offered by us at more competitive prices. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business will be harmed through loss of customers or increased negative pricing pressure that would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our operating results.\nLack of availability, or significant increases in the cost, of raw materials used in manufacturing our products could adversely impact our profit margins and operating results.\nAffordable high-quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of our business units due to the nature of the products we manufacture. In addition, maintaining good supply relationships is essential to our ongoing operations. See Item 1. Business - Materials Sourcing for more information.\n\u2022\nWe maintain several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to regulatory, performance, quality, support, or price considerations. Unavailability or delivery delays of single-source components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in a timely manner. The effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher-volume or more profitable products. Even where alternative sources of supply are available, qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of net sales. Additionally, FDA requirements for products approved through the ANDA or NDA process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate material source. As a result, the loss of a single-source supplier could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe rapid increase in cost of many raw materials from inflationary forces, such as increased energy costs, and our ability or inability to pass on these increases to our customers could have a negative material impact on our financial results.\n\u2022\nOur infant formula products require certain key raw ingredients that are derived from raw milk, such as skim milk powder, whey protein powder, and lactose. Our supply of milk-based ingredients may be limited by the ability of individual dairy farmers and cooperatives to provide raw milk in the amount and quality we deem necessary. Raw milk production is influenced by factors beyond our control including seasonal and environmental factors, governmental agricultural and environmental policy, and global demand. We cannot guarantee that there will be sufficient supplies of these key ingredients necessary to produce infant formula.\n\u2022\nOur products, and the raw materials used to make those products, generally have limited shelf lives. Our inventory levels are based, in part, on expectations regarding future sales. We may experience build-ups in inventory if sales slow. Any significant shortfall in sales may result in higher inventory levels of raw materials and finished products, thereby increasing the risk of inventory spoilage and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. Cargo thefts and/or diversions, and economically or maliciously motivated product tampering on store shelves may occur, causing unexpected shortages, which may have a material impact on our operations.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third parties to source many of our raw materials, as well as to manufacture sterile, injectable products that we distribute. We maintain a strict program of verification and product testing throughout the ingredient sourcing and manufacturing process to identify potential counterfeit ingredients, adulterants, and\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\ntoxic substances. Nevertheless, discovery of previously unknown problems with the raw materials or product manufacturing processes, or new data suggesting an unacceptable safety risk associated therewith, could result in a voluntary or mandatory withdrawal of the contaminated product from the marketplace, either temporarily or permanently. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs and lost revenue, harm our reputation, and may give rise to product liability litigation.\nA disruption at any of our main manufacturing facilities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing operations are concentrated in a few locations. See Item 1. Business - Manufacturing and Distribution for more information on our significant operations. A significant disruption at one or more of these facilities, whether it be due to fire, natural disaster, power loss, intentional acts of vandalism, war, terrorism, insufficient quality, or pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, there has been increasing regulatory scrutiny of pharmaceutical manufacturers, resulting in product recalls, plant shutdowns and other required remedial actions. If any regulatory body were to require one or more of our significant manufacturing facilities to cease or limit production, our business could be adversely affected.\nAny breach or disruption of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur systems, information, and operations, as well as our independent vendor relationships (where they support information technology and manufacturing infrastructure), are highly complex and vulnerable to disruption or damage from security breaches, hacking, data theft, denial of service attacks, human error, sabotage, industrial espionage, and computer viruses. Given our position in the pharmaceutical industry, we may be more likely to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of such events. While we continue to employ resources to monitor our systems and protect our infrastructure, these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed. Risks include:\n\u2022\nBreaches or disruptions could impair our ability to develop, meet regulatory approval efforts for, produce, and/or ship products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nAny system issue, whether as a result of an intentional breach or a natural disaster, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, experience lower sales volume, and incur significant liabilities; and\n\u2022\nWe could incur significant expense in addressing a disruption and in addressing related data security and privacy concerns.\nBecause our business depends upon certain customers for a significant portion of our sales, our business would be adversely affected by a disruption of our relationship with these customers or any material adverse change in these customers' business.\nSales to our largest customer, Walmart, comprised approximately 15% of fiscal year 2015 net sales. While no other customer individually comprised more than 10% of total net sales, we do have other significant customers. If our relationship with one or more of these other customers, including the terms for doing business with the customers, changes significantly, it could have a material adverse impact on us. See Item 1. Business - Significant Customers for more information.\nMany of our customers, which include chain drug stores, wholesalers, distributors, hospital systems, and group purchasing organizations, continue to merge or consolidate. Such consolidation has provided and may continue to provide them with additional purchasing leverage, and consequently may increase the pricing pressures we face. The emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies enable those groups to extract price discounts on our products. In addition, a number of our customers have instituted sourcing programs limiting the number of suppliers of generic pharmaceutical products carried by that customer. These developments have resulted in heightened pricing pressure on our products, as well as competition among generic drug producers for business from a smaller and more selective customer base.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nAdditionally, if we are unable to maintain adequately high levels of customer service over time, customers may choose to assess penalties, obtain alternate sources for products, and/or end their relationships with us.\nOur Specialty Sciences segment generates revenue primarily from royalties on Tysabri\u00ae, and any negative developments related to Tysabri\u00ae could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe occasionally enter into arrangements that entitle us to potential royalties from third parties. Our most significant royalty is the Tysabri\u00ae royalty received quarterly from Biogen Idec, which generated $338.4 million of pretax income in fiscal year 2015. See Item 1. Business - Specialty Sciences for more information on our Tysabri\u00ae royalty arrangement. Our pretax income could be adversely affected if the royalty streams decline in future periods. Factors that may have an adverse effect on our Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream are as follows:\n\u2022\nForeign currency movement, which could have a negative impact on Biogen Inc.'s Tysabri\u00ae sales, thereby reducing our royalties;\n\u2022\nCompanies working to develop new therapies or alternative formulations of products for multiple sclerosis that, if successfully developed, would compete with and could gain greater acceptance than Tysabri\u00ae and damage our market share;\n\u2022\nAny negative developments relating to Tysabri\u00ae, such as safety, efficacy, or reimbursement issues, could reduce demand for Tysabri\u00ae; and\n\u2022\nAdverse regulatory or legislative developments could limit or prohibit the sale of Tysabri\u00ae, such as restrictions on the use of Tysabri\u00ae or safety-related label changes, including enhanced risk management programs, which may significantly reduce expected net sales and require significant expense and management time to address the associated legal and regulatory issues.\nAdditionally, Tysabri\u00ae sales growth cannot be assured given the significant restrictions on its use and the significant safety warnings in the label, including the risk of developing Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (\"PML\"), a serious brain infection. The risk of developing PML may increase with prior immunosuppressant use, longer treatment duration, or the presence of JC virus antibodies. Increased incidence of PML could limit sales growth, prompt regulatory review, require significant changes to the label, or result in market withdrawal. In addition, the result of ongoing or future clinical trials involving Tysabri\u00ae or other adverse events reported in association with the use of Tysabri\u00ae may have an adverse impact on prescribing behavior and reduce sales of Tysabri\u00ae.\nWe are dependent on the services of certain key executive and scientific employees. The failure to attract and retain such employees may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the services of certain key employees, and our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. In particular, key employees of acquired companies may perceive uncertainty about their future role until strategies regarding the combined business are fully executed, and the recent offers from Mylan may affect the recruitment and retention of our workforce. Key functions for us include executive managers, operational managers, R&D scientists, information technology specialists, financial and legal specialists, regulatory professionals, quality compliance specialists, and sales/marketing personnel. If we are unable to attract or retain key qualified employees, our future operating results may be adversely impacted.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are dependent upon consumers' perception of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products, and may be affected by changing consumer preferences. Negative consumer perception may arise from media reports, product liability claims, regulatory investigations, or recalls, regardless of whether they involve us or our products. The mere publication of information asserting defects in products or ingredients, or concerns about our products or the materials used in our products, could discourage consumers from buying our products, regardless of whether such information is scientifically supported.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nOur products involve risks such as product contamination, spoilage, mislabeling, and tampering that could require us to recall one or more of our products. Serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against us that, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products, product seizures, loss of certain licenses, delays in the issuance of governmental approvals for new products, or other governmental penalties, all of which could be detrimental to our reputation and reduce demand for our products.\n\u2022\nWe cannot guarantee that counterfeiting, imitation or other tampering with our products will not occur or that we will be able to detect and resolve it. Any counterfeiting or contamination of any products could negatively impact our sales, particularly if counterfeit or imitation products cause death or injury to consumers.\n\u2022\nMany of the brands we acquired from Omega have European recognition. This recognition is the result of the large investments Omega has made in its products over many years. The quality and safety of the products are critical to our business. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, efficacy, or similar matters, sentiments toward us and our products could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nOur BCH segment's financial success is dependent on the success of its brands, and the success of these brands can suffer if marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand\u2019s image or its ability to attract consumers. In addition, given the association of individual products within the commercial network of our BCH segment, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of other products, thereby potentially hurting our financial results.\n\u2022\nPowdered infant formula products are not sterile. All of our infant formula products must be prepared and maintained according to label instruction to retain their flavor and nutritional value and avoid contamination or deterioration. Depending on the product, a risk of contamination or deterioration may exist at each stage of the production cycle, including the purchase and delivery of raw materials, the processing and packaging of food products, and the use and handling by consumers, hospital personnel, and healthcare professionals. In the event that certain of our infant formula products are found or alleged to have suffered contamination or deterioration, whether or not under our control, our reputation and our infant formula product category sales could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nScientific studies and media reports can have a negative impact on the demand for certain of our products, even when they do not directly involve us. For instance, there have been recent reports questioning the efficacy of regular consumption of certain vitamins and supplements. Additionally, the New York Attorney General has asked several major retailers to halt sales of herbal supplements. Our VMS sales have been negatively impacted by the media attention.\nIncreasing use of social media could give rise to liability, breaches of data security, or reputation damage.\nThe Company and our employees increasingly utilize social media as a means of internal and external communication.\n\u2022\nTo the extent that we seek to use social media tools as a means to communicate about our products and/or business, there are uncertainties as to the rules that apply to such communications, or as to the interpretations that authorities will apply to the rules that exist. As a result, despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules, there is risk that our use of social media for such purposes may cause us to be found in violation of them. A violation of such guidelines may damage our reputation as well as cause potential lawsuits and adversely affect our operating activities.\n\u2022\nOur employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media tools in ways that may not be aligned with our social media strategy, and that may give rise to liability, or could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nNegative posts or comments about us, store brands or generic pharmaceuticals, or our products in social media could seriously damage our reputation and could adversely affect the price of our securities. In addition, negative posts or comments about our products could result in increased pharmacovigilance reporting requirements, which may give rise to liability if we fail to fully comply with such requirements.\nOur quarterly results are impacted by a number of factors, some of which are beyond the control of our management, that may result in significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in operating results.\nOur quarterly results are impacted by a number of factors, some of which are beyond the control of management, that may result in significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in operating results. Some of these factors include the severity, length and timing of the cough/cold/flu and allergy season, and flea and tick season, the timing of new product approvals and introductions by us and our competitors, price competition, changes in the regulatory environment, changes in accounting pronouncements, the magnitude and timing of R&D investments, changes in the levels of inventories maintained by our customers, and the timing of retailer promotional programs.\nWe may not realize the benefits of business acquisitions and divestitures we enter into, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOne of our growth strategies is inorganic growth through the acquisition of products and companies that we expect will benefit the Company. This strategy comes with a number of financial, managerial, and operational risks. We may not realize the benefits of an acquisition because of integration and other challenges, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nThe difficulty involved with managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\nUncertainties involved in assessing the value, strengths, and potential profitability of, and identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks, and contingent and other liabilities of the respective parties;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated changes in the business, industry, market or general economic conditions different from the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the transaction;\n\u2022\nPotential inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies, or return on investment, from an acquisition in the amounts or on the timeframe anticipated;\n\u2022\nSubstantial demands on our management, operational resources, technology, and financial and internal control systems, which could lead to dissatisfaction and potential loss of key customers, management or employees;\n\u2022\nIntegration activities may detract attention from our day-to-day business, and there might be substantial costs associated with the transaction process or other material adverse effects as a result of these integration efforts; and\n\u2022\nWe may undertake financing to complete an acquisition that impacts our liquidity, credit ratings and financial position, thereby making it more difficult, restrictive or expensive to raise future capital.\nActual results may differ from pro forma financial information of the combined companies due to changes in the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, changes in assumptions used to form estimates, differences in accounting policies between the companies, and completion of purchase accounting.\nWe have acquired significant assets that could become impaired or subject us to losses and may result in an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe have recorded significant intangible assets and goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of previous acquisitions, which could become impaired and lead to material charges in the future. We regularly review our intangible assets and goodwill for impairment. Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever impairment indicators are present. We perform an impairment analysis on intangible assets subject to amortization when there is an indication that the carrying amount of any\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nindividual asset may not be recoverable. Any significant change in market conditions, estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicates a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known. Our annual goodwill impairment testing performed in the fourth fiscal year quarter resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $6.8 million for fiscal year 2015. There were no intangible asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal year 2015. See Item 8. Note 3 for further information.\nGlobal Risks\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to risks arising from the international scope of our operations.\nWe manufacture, source raw materials, and sell our products in a number of countries. We are subject to risks associated with international manufacturing and sales, including:\n\u2022\nUnexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nProblems related to markets with different cultural biases or political systems;\n\u2022\nPossible difficulties in enforcing agreements;\n\u2022\nLonger payment cycles and shipping lead-times;\n\u2022\nDifficulties obtaining export or import licenses or changes in import/export regulations; and\n\u2022\nImposition of withholding or other taxes.\nAdditionally, we are subject to periodic reviews and audits by governmental authorities responsible for administering import/export regulations. To the extent that we are unable to successfully defend against an audit or review, we may be required to pay assessments, penalties and increased duties.\nCertain of our facilities operate in a special purpose subzone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board, which allows us certain tax advantages on products and raw materials shipped through these facilities. If the Foreign Trade Zone Board were to revoke the subzone designation or limit its use by us, we could be subject to increased duties.\nAlthough we believe that we conduct our business in compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery and economic sanctions or other anti-corruption laws, if we are found to not be in compliance with such laws or other anti-corruption laws, we could be subject to governmental investigations, legal or regulatory proceedings, substantial fines, and/or other legal or equitable penalties. This risk increases in locations outside of the U.S., particularly in locations that have not previously had to comply with the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws.\nCurrent and changing global economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nA number of non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we do business have been negatively impacted by slowing growth rates or recessionary conditions and market volatility.\n\u2022\nSeveral emerging market economies are particularly vulnerable to the impact of rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, weaker oil and other commodity prices, and large external deficits. While some of these jurisdictions are showing signs of stabilization or recovery, others, such as Russia and Greece, continue to experience increasing levels of stress and volatility. Risks in one country can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in another country or countries. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our operations.\n\u2022\nWhile the challenging global economic environment has not had a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources, there can be no assurance that possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capital resources, impact our ability to obtain financing in the future, or decrease the value of our assets.\n\u2022\nOur customers could be adversely impacted if economic conditions worsen. Our CHC segment does not advertise its products like national brand companies and thus is largely dependent on retailer promotional activities to drive sales volume and increase market share. If our customers do not have the ability to invest in store brand promotional activities, our sales may suffer. Additionally, while we actively review the credit\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nworthiness of our customers and suppliers, we cannot fully predict to what extent they may be negatively impacted by slowing economic growth.\nThe international scope of our business exposes us to risks associated with foreign exchange rates.\nWe report our financial results in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our net sales, assets, indebtedness and other liabilities, and costs are denominated in foreign currencies. These currencies include among others the euro, Indian rupee, British pound, Canadian dollar, Israel shekel, Australian dollar, and Mexican peso. The addition of Omega, a euro-denominated business that will represent a significant portion of our future net sales and earnings and a substantial portion of our net assets, has significantly increased our exposure to changes in the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. In addition, approximately 25% of Omega\u2019s sales are in other foreign currencies, with the majority of the product costs for these markets denominated in euros. Our results of operations and, in some cases, cash flows, have in the past been and may in the future be adversely affected by movements in exchange rates. In addition, we may also be exposed to credit risks in some of those markets. We may implement currency hedges or take other actions intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not successful in mitigating the effects of changes in exchange rates on our business, any such changes could materially impact our results.\nWe operate in jurisdictions that could be affected by economic and political instability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations outside the U.S. could be affected by economic or political instability, embargoes, military hostilities, unstable governments and legal systems, and inter-governmental disputes. We have significant operations in Israel, which has experienced varying degrees of hostility in recent years. Doing business in Israel and certain other countries involves the following risks:\n\u2022\nCertain countries and international organizations have refused to do business with Israel or with Israeli companies. We are also precluded from marketing our products to certain countries due to U.S. and Israeli regulatory restrictions. International economic sanctions and boycotts of our products could negatively impact our sales and ability to export our products.\n\u2022\nOur facilities in Israel are within a conflict zone. If terrorist acts or military actions were to result in substantial damage to our facilities, our business activities would be disrupted since, with respect to most products, we would need to obtain prior FDA approval for a change in manufacturing site. In addition, our insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022\nCertain of our customers or suppliers may decline to travel to Israel, which would force us to make alternative arrangements where necessary. The United States Department of State has at times issued an advisory regarding travel to these countries. As a result of the State Department's advisories, the FDA has at various times curtailed or prohibited its inspectors from traveling to inspect facilities. If these inspectors are unable to inspect our facilities, the FDA could withhold approval for new products intended to be produced at those facilities.\nRisks Related to Litigation and Insurance\nWe are or may become involved in lawsuits and may experience unfavorable outcomes of such proceedings.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits arising from various commercial matters, including, but not limited to, competitive issues, contract issues, intellectual property matters, false advertising/unfair competition, taxation matters, workers' compensation, product quality/recall issues, environmental remediation issues, and regulatory issues. Litigation is unpredictable and can be costly. No assurance can be made that litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in the future. See Item 8. Note 14 for more information.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to liability if our products violate applicable laws or regulations in the jurisdictions where our products are distributed. The successful assertion of product liability or other product-related claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages and incur substantial legal expenses. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful, not merited, or not fully pursued, we may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim, and our reputation may suffer.\n\u2022\nWe are a defendant in product liability lawsuits arising out of serious adverse events, including deaths, which occurred in patients taking Tysabri\u00ae. We expect additional product liability lawsuits related to Tysabri\u00ae usage to be filed. Tysabri\u00ae's distributor, Biogen Idec, and Perrigo will each be responsible for 50% of losses and expenses arising out of any Tysabri\u00ae product liability claims. Along with Biogen Idec, we intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits, however, we cannot predict how these cases will be resolved. Adverse results in one or more of these cases could result in substantial monetary judgments.\n\u2022\nWe may face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. While we do not have any material remediation liabilities currently outstanding, we may in the future face liability for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under or in our currently or formerly owned property, or from a third-party disposal facility that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The actual or alleged presence of these substances, or the failure to remediate them, could have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on our ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. There can be no assurance that environmental liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nOur BCH segment regularly makes advertising claims regarding the effectiveness of its products, which we are responsible for defending. An unsuccessful defense of product-related claims could result in potentially significant monetary damages and substantial legal expenses. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, not merited, or not fully pursued, we may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim, and our reputation could suffer.\nThird-party patents and other intellectual property rights may limit our ability to bring new products to market and may subject us to potential legal liability, causing us to incur significant costs.\nThe manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\u2022\nAs a manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products, the ability of our CHC and Rx Pharmaceutical segments to bring new products to market is often limited by third-party patents or proprietary rights and regulatory exclusivity periods awarded on products. The cost and time for us to develop prescription and Rx-to-OTC switch products is significantly greater than the rest of the new products that we introduce. Any failure to bring new products to market in a timely manner without incurring legal liability could cause us to lose market share, and our operating results could suffer.\n\u2022\nWe could have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties. This could require us to incur substantial expense and could divert significant effort of our technical and management personnel. If we are found to have infringed on the rights of others, we could lose our right to develop or manufacture some products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Additionally, if we choose to settle a dispute through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties that may not be on terms we believe to be acceptable. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products.\n\u2022\nAt times, our CHC or Rx Pharmaceuticals segments may seek approval to market NDA or ANDA products before the expiration of patents for those products, based upon our belief that such patents are invalid, unenforceable or would not be infringed by our products. In these cases we may face significant patent\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nlitigation. Depending upon a complex analysis of a variety of legal and commercial factors, we may, in certain circumstances, elect to market a generic pharmaceutical product while litigation is pending, before any court decision, or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending, known as an \"at risk\" launch. The risk involved in an \"at risk\" launch can be substantial because, if a patent holder ultimately prevails, the remedies available to the patent holder may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the holder, which are often significantly higher than the profits we make from selling the generic version of the product. By electing to proceed in this manner, we could face substantial damages if we receive an adverse final court decision. In the case where a patent holder is able to prove that our infringement was \"willful\" or \"exceptional,\" under applicable law, the patent holder may be awarded up to three times the amount of its actual damages or we may be required to pay attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe success of certain of our products depends on the effectiveness of measures we take to protect our intellectual property rights and patents.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may manufacture and market similar products.\n\u2022\nWe have been issued patents covering certain of our products, and we have filed, and expect to continue to file, patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies and products in various countries, including the U.S. Any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by us may not provide us with any significant competitive advantages for our products or may even be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by competitors. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or commercializing non-infringing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products.\n\u2022\nWe also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation that we seek to protect, in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees, suppliers, employees, and consultants. If these agreements are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements. Furthermore, trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors or, if patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research, we may not be able to maintain the value of such intellectual property rights.\nSignificant increases in the cost or decreases in the availability of the insurance we maintain could adversely impact our financial condition.\nTo protect the Company against various potential liabilities, we maintain a variety of insurance programs, including property, general and product, and directors' and officers' liability. We may reevaluate and change the types and levels of insurance coverage that we purchase. We are self-insured when insurance is not available or not available at reasonable premiums. Risks associated with insurance plans include:\n\u2022\nInsurance costs could increase significantly, or the availability of insurance may decrease, either of which could adversely impact our financial condition;\n\u2022\nDeductible or retention amounts could increase or our coverage could be reduced in the future and to the extent losses occur, there could be an adverse effect on our financial results depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance coverage we maintained;\n\u2022\nProduct liability insurance may not be available to us at an economically reasonable cost (or at all for certain specific products) or our insurance may not adequately cover our liability in connection with product liability claims (see Item 8. Note 14 for further information related to legal proceedings); and\n\u2022\nAs our business inherently exposes us to claims for injuries allegedly resulting from the use of our products, we may become subject to claims for which we are not adequately insured. Unanticipated payment of a large claim may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nTax Related Risks\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") may not agree with the conclusion that we are treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nAlthough we are incorporated in Ireland, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"). For U.S. federal tax purposes, a corporation generally is considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because we are an Irish incorporated entity, we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nFor Perrigo Company plc to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under section 7874 of the Code, either (i) the former stockholders of Perrigo Company must own (within the meaning of section 7874 of the Code) less than 80% (by both vote and value) of our stock by reason of holding shares in Perrigo Company (the \"ownership test\") as of the closing of the acquisition or (ii) we must have substantial business activities in Ireland after the Elan acquisition (taking into account the activities of our expanded affiliated group).\nUpon our acquisition of Elan, Perrigo Company stockholders held 71% (by both vote and value) of our shares. As a result, we believe that under current law, we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, we cannot assure that the IRS will agree with our position that the ownership test is satisfied. There is limited guidance regarding the section 7874 provisions, including the application of the ownership test.\nBased on the limited guidance available, we currently expect that Section 7874 of the Code likely will limit our and our U.S. affiliates\u2019 ability to use their U.S. tax attributes such as net operating losses to offset certain U.S. taxable income, if any, generated by the Elan acquisition or certain specified transactions for a period of time following the Elan acquisition.\nChanges to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.\nWe believe that under current law, we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, any of the following could adversely affect our status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes:\n\u2022\nChanges to the inversion rules in section 7874 of the Code, the IRS Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or other IRS guidance and\n\u2022\nLegislative proposals aimed at expanding the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence.\nThe Office of the Revenue Commissioners, U.S. Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and other Government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of \"base erosion and profit shifting\", where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. This focus could lead to a change in tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business.\nAny of these changes could have a prospective or retroactive application to us, our shareholders, and affiliates, and could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.\nOur effective tax rate may change in the future, which could adversely impact our future results from operations.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, which may impact our future results from operations. These factors include, but are not limited to:\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nIncome tax rate changes by governments;\n\u2022\nThe jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nChanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nAdjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022\nAdjustments to our interpretation of transfer pricing standards, changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives;\n\u2022\nChanges in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (such as proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform);\n\u2022\nChanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u2022\nExpiration or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives; and\n\u2022\nRepatriation of non-U.S. earnings with respect to which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.\nThe resolution of uncertain tax positions could be unfavorable, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that our tax filings are prepared in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audit, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties or interest assessments.\n\u2022\nThe IRS audit of fiscal years 2009 and 2010 had previously concluded with the issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency on August 27, 2014. While we had previously agreed on certain adjustments and made associated payments of $8.0 million inclusive of interest in November 2014, the statutory notice of deficiency asserted various additional positions, including transfer pricing, relative to the same fiscal 2009 and 2010 audit. The statutory notice asserted an incremental tax obligation of approximately $68.9 million, inclusive of interest and penalties. We disagree with the IRS\u2019s positions asserted in the notice of deficiency. In January 2015, we paid this amount, a prerequisite to being able to contest the IRS\u2019s positions in U.S. Federal court, and in June 2015 we filed a request for a refund. In the event that the IRS denies our request for a refund, we intend to contest the IRS\u2019s asserted positions in U.S. Federal court. An unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n\u2022\nThe IRS is auditing fiscal years 2011 and 2012, and the Israel Tax Authorities are auditing the same period. There are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which are individually significant. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of any audit or related litigation.\nThe government programs in Israel in which we participate and the tax benefits we receive require us to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our costs and tax expenses.\nWe receive grants for research and development from the Office of the Chief Scientist in Israel's Ministry of Industry and Trade. To continue to be eligible for these grants, our development projects must be approved by the Chief Scientist on a case-by-case basis. If our development projects are not approved by the Chief Scientist, we will not receive grants to fund these projects, which would increase research and development costs. The receipt of such grants subjects us to certain restrictions and pre-approval requirements, which may be conditioned on additional royalty payments with rights to transfer intellectual property and/or production abroad. We also receive tax benefits, in particular exemptions and reductions, as a result of the Privileged Enterprise status of certain existing operations in Israel. To be eligible for these tax benefits, we must maintain our Privileged Enterprise status by meeting conditions, including making specified investments in fixed assets located in Israel and investing additional equity in itself and its Israeli subsidiaries and by meeting projections provided to the regulatory agencies. If we fail to meet these conditions in the future, the tax benefits would be canceled, and we could be required to refund the tax benefits already received. These tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level. If such benefits are reduced or eliminated in the future, our results of operations will be adversely impacted.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nIn fiscal year 2011, Israel enacted new tax legislation that reduced the effective tax rate to 10% for 2011 and 2012, 7% for 2013 and 2014, and 6% thereafter for certain qualifying entities that elect to be taxed under the new legislation. This legislation was rescinded as announced in the Official Gazette on August 5, 2013. The new legislation enacted a 9% rate for certain qualifying entities that elect to be taxed under the new legislation. We have two entities that have previously elected the new tax legislation for years after fiscal 2011. Therefore, the above risk is only applicable to us for fiscal year 2011 as statutes remain open for this year.\nRisks Related to Capital and Liquidity\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nWe anticipate that cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings available under our credit facilities will substantially fund working capital and capital expenditures. Our business requires continuous capital investments, and there can be no assurance that financial capital will always be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect the business.\n\u2022\nDowngrades to our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase borrowing costs on current or future financing, including via trade payables with vendors. Customers' inclination to purchase goods from us may also be affected by the publicity associated with deterioration of our credit ratings.\n\u2022\nOur senior credit facilities, the agreements governing our senior notes, and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain a number of restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied.\n\u2022\nWe also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. These restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions. If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities, agreements governing our senior notes, and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could be in default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable.\n\u2022\nAny default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our senior notes or other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we would be able to repay or refinance our debt or obtain sufficient new financing.\n\u2022\nThere are various maturity dates associated with our credit facilities, senior notes, and other debt facilities. There is no assurance that cash, future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. Further, there is no assurance that future refinancing or renegotiation of our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt facilities, or additional agreements will not have materially different or more stringent terms.\nAny additional shares we may issue could dilute your ownership in us.\n\u2022\nUnder Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders, and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by the articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders.\n\u2022\nSubject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash, but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemption rights by way of special resolution with respect to any particular allotment of shares.\n\u2022\nOur articles of association contain, as permitted by Irish company law, a provision authorizing the board to issue new shares for cash without offering preemption rights. The authorization of the directors to issue shares and the authorization of the waiver of the statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years, and we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nalways be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to, or otherwise adversely affect, our shareholders.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014 (the \"Act\"). The Act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits, and indemnification of directors.\n\u2022\nUnder Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. As a result, shareholders of Irish companies do not have the right to bring an action against the directors or officers of a company, except in limited circumstances.\n\u2022\nDepending on the circumstances, shareholders may be subject to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law as a result of the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of ordinary shares, including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax, and capital acquisitions tax.\n\u2022\nThere is no treaty between Ireland and the U.S. providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. Before a foreign judgment would be deemed enforceable in Ireland, the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction and be for a final and conclusive sum. An Irish court may exercise its right to refuse to recognize and enforce a foreign judgment if the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud, if the judgment violated Irish public policy, if the judgment is in breach of natural justice, or if it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment.\n\u2022\nAn Irish court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. Judgments of U.S. courts of liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforced by Irish courts if deemed to be contrary to public policy in Ireland.\nWe are subject to Irish takeover rules under which our Board of Directors is not permitted to take any action without Irish Takeover Panel approval that might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares once we have received an approach that may lead to an offer, or have reason to believe an offer is imminent. Further, it could be more difficult for us to obtain shareholder approval for a merger or negotiated transaction than if we were a U.S. company because the shareholder approval requirements for certain types of transactions differ, and in some cases are greater, under Irish law.\nWe may be limited in our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nA number of factors may limit our ability to pay dividends in the future, including:\n\u2022\nThe availability of distributable reserves, as approved by our shareholders and the Irish High Court;\n\u2022\nOur ability to receive cash dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nCompliance with applicable laws and covenants; and\n\u2022\nOur financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.", "PERMNO": 77182, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PRGO"}
