RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a materially adverse impact on our operations. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected, and in the future could affect, our operations. You should carefully consider these risks. These risks are not the only ones we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or any combination of the foregoing could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur risks are described in detail below; however, the more significant risks we face can be summarized into several broad categories, including:\nThe future evolution of the technology industries in which we operate is difficult to predict, highly competitive and requires continual innovation and development, strategic planning, capital investment, demand planning and space utilization management to remain viable. We face on-going challenges to develop new services and products to maintain current customers and obtain new ones. In addition, technological advantages can rapidly decrease value, creating constant pressure on pricing and cost structures and hindering our ability to maintain or increase margins.\nWe are dependent on numerous suppliers, vendors and other third-party providers across a wide spectrum of products and services to operate our business. These include real estate, network capacity and access points, network equipment and supplies, power and other vendors. In many cases the suppliers of these products and services are not only vendors, they are also competitors. While we maintain contractual agreements with these suppliers, we have limited ability to guarantee they will meet their obligations, or that we will be able to continue to obtain the products and services necessary to operate our business in sufficient supply, or at an acceptable cost.\nOur business model involves designing, deploying and maintaining a complex set of network infrastructures at considerable capital expense. We invest significant resources to help maintain the integrity of our infrastructure and support our customers; however, we face constant challenges related to our infrastructure, including capital forecasting, demand planning, space utilization management, physical failures, obsolescence, maintaining redundancies, physical and electronic security breaches, power demand and other risks.\nOur financial results have fluctuated over time and we have a history of losses, including in each of the past three years. We have also incurred significant charges related to impairments and restructuring efforts, which, along with other factors, may contribute to volatility in our stock price.\nRisks Related to our Industries\nWe cannot predict with certainty the future evolution of the IT infrastructure market in which we compete, and may be unable to respond effectively or on a timely basis to rapid technological change.\nThe IT infrastructure market in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, industry standards and customer needs, as well as by frequent new product and service introductions. As evidenced by our investment in and offering to our enterprise customers of a full portfolio of IT infrastructure solutions, innovative new IT technologies and evolving industry standards have the potential to become the \u201cnew normal,\u201d either replacing or providing efficient, potentially lower-cost alternatives to other, more traditional, IT communications services. The adoption of such new technologies or industry standards could render our existing services obsolete and unmarketable.\nOur failure to anticipate new technology trends that may eventually may become the preferred technology choice of our customers, to adapt our technology to any changes in the prevailing industry standards (or, conversely, for there to be an absence of generally accepted standards) could materially and adversely affect our business. Our pursuit of and investment in necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense, but will not guarantee that we can successfully adapt our network and services to alternative access devices and technologies. Technological advances in computer processing, storage, capacity, component size or power management could result in a decreased demand for our data center and hosting services. Likewise, if the Internet backbone becomes subject to a form of central management or gatekeeping control, or if ISPs establish an economic settlement arrangement regarding the exchange of traffic between Internet networks that is passed on to Internet users, the demand for our IP and CDN services could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to develop new and enhanced services and products that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable to improve the performance and features of our existing services and products or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe market in which we compete is constantly evolving. The process of expending research and development to create new services and products, and the technologies that support them is expensive, time and labor intensive and uncertain. We may not understand the market demand for new services and products or not be able to overcome technical problems with new services and products. The demand for top research and development talent is high, and there is significant competition for these scarce resources.\n- 5 -\nOur future success may depend on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by expending research and development in a cost-effective manner to acquire talent, develop and introduce new services, products and upgrades on a timely basis. New product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u25cf\nsourcing, identifying, obtaining and maintaining qualified research and development staff with the appropriate skill and expertise;\n\u25cf\nmanaging the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements, which historically has been longer than expected;\n\u25cf\nidentifying and adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors\u2019 and customers\u2019 services and products;\n\u25cf\ndeveloping or expanding efficient sales channels;\n\u25cf\nentering into new or unproven markets where we have limited experience;\n\u25cf\nmanaging new service and product service strategies and integrating them with our existing services and products;\n\u25cf\nincorporating acquired products and technologies;\n\u25cf\ntrade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship new products to international markets; and\n\u25cf\nobtaining required technology licenses and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products.\nIn addition, if we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace with industry trends, our revenue could be negatively impacted. If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new services, products and upgrades are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, we may experience a decrease in our revenues and earnings.\nOur capital investment strategy for data center and IT infrastructure services expansion may contain erroneous assumptions causing our return on invested capital to be materially lower than expected.\nOur strategic decision to invest capital in expanding our data center and IT infrastructure services is based on, among other things, significant assumptions related to expected growth of these markets, our competitors\u2019 plans and current and expected server utilization and data center occupancy rates. We have no way of ensuring the data or models we use to deploy capital into existing markets, or to create new markets, has been or will be accurate. Errors or imprecision in these estimates, especially those related to customer demand, could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results and could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience difficulties in executing our capital investment strategy to expand our IT infrastructure services, upgrade existing facilities or establish new facilities, products, services or capabilities.\nAs part of our strategy, we may continue to expand our IT infrastructure services and may encounter challenges and difficulties in implementing our expansion plans. This could cause us to grow at a slower pace than projected in our capital investment modeling. These challenges and difficulties relate to our ability to:\n\u25cf\nidentify and obtain the use of locations meeting our selection criteria on competitive terms;\n\u25cf\nestimate costs and control delays;\n\u25cf\nobtain necessary permits on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u25cf\ngenerate sufficient cash flow from operations or through current or additional debt or equity financings to support these expansion plans;\n\u25cf\nestablish key relationships with IT infrastructure providers;\n\u25cf\nhire, train, retain and manage sufficient operational and technical employees and supporting personnel;\n\u25cf\nobtain the necessary power density and supply from local utility companies;\n\u25cf\navoid labor issues impacting our suppliers, such as a strike; and\n\u25cf\nidentify and obtain contractors that will not default on the agreed upon contract performance.\nIf we encounter greater than anticipated difficulties in implementing our expansion plans, are unable to deploy new IT infrastructure services or do not adequately control expenses associated with the deployment of new IT infrastructure services, it may be necessary to take additional actions, which could divert management\u2019s attention and strain our operational and financial resources. We may not successfully address any or all of these challenges, and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur estimation of future data center space needs may be inaccurate, leading to missed sales opportunities or additional expenses through unnecessary carrying costs.\nAdding data center space involves significant capital outlays well ahead of planned usage. Although we believe we can accurately project future space needs in particular markets, these plans require significant estimates and assumptions based on available market data. Errors or imprecision in these estimates or the data on which the estimates are based could result in either an oversupply or undersupply of space in a particular market and cause actual results to differ materially from expected results and correspondingly have a material adverse impact on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n- 6 -\nPricing pressure may continue to decrease our revenue for certain services such as Internet connectivity, data transit and/or data storage services.\nPricing for Internet connectivity, data transit and data storage services has declined significantly in recent years and may continue to decline, which would continue to impact our IP services segment. By bundling their services and reducing the overall cost of their service offerings, certain of our competitors may be able to provide customers with reduced costs in connection with their Internet connectivity, data transit and data storage services or private network services, thereby significantly increasing the pressure on us to decrease our prices. Increased price competition, significant price deflation and other related competitive pressures have eroded, and could continue to erode, our revenue and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to control or reduce our costs. Because we rely on ISPs to deliver our services and have agreed with some of these providers to purchase minimum amounts of service at predetermined prices, our profitability could be adversely affected by competitive price reductions to our customers even if accompanied with an increased number of customers.\nThe market in which we operate is highly competitive and has experienced recent consolidation which may continue, and we may lack the financial and other resources, expertise or capability necessary to capture increased market share or maintain our market share.\nWe compete in the IT infrastructure services market, which is rapidly evolving, highly competitive and likely to be characterized by overcapacity, industry consolidation and continued pricing pressure. A number of our competitors have recently consolidated and such consolidation is likely to continue. In addition, our competitors may acquire software-application vendors or technology providers, enabling them to more effectively compete with us. We believe that participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve a significant presence to compete effectively. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that would impede our ability to compete successfully in the IT infrastructure market. Further, our business is not as developed as that of many of our competitors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and market resources, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry. Many of our competitors may be able to:\n\u25cf\ndevelop and expand their IT infrastructure and service offerings more rapidly;\n\u25cf\nadapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly;\n\u25cf\ntake advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily; or\n\u25cf\ndevote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can.\nIn addition, IT infrastructure providers may make technological advancements to enhance the quality of their services, which could negatively impact the demand for our IT infrastructure services. We also expect that we will face additional competition as we expand our product offerings, including competition from technology and telecommunications companies and non-technology companies which are entering the market through leveraging their existing or expanded network services and cloud infrastructure. Further, the ability of some of these potential competitors to bundle other services and products with their network services could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Various companies also are exploring the possibility of providing, or are currently providing, high-speed, intelligent data services that use connections to more than one network or use alternative delivery methods, including the cable television infrastructure, direct broadcast satellites and wireless local loops.\nWe may lack financial and other resources, expertise or capability necessary to maintain or capture increased market share. Increased competition and technological advancements by our competitors could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to retain existing customers or add new customers may cause our revenue to decline.\nIn addition to adding new customers, we must sell additional services to existing customers and encourage them to increase their usage levels to increase our revenue. If our existing and prospective customers do not perceive our services to be of sufficiently high value and quality, we may not be able to retain our current customers or attract new ones. Our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our services after the expiration of their initial commitment, and these agreements may not be renewed at the same price or level of service, if at all. Due to the significant upfront costs of implementing IT infrastructure services, if our customers do not renew or cancel their agreements, we may not be able to recover the initial costs associated with bringing additional infrastructure on-line.\nOur customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ntheir level of satisfaction with our services;\n\u25cf\nour ability to provide features and functionality demanded by our customers;\n- 7 -\n\u25cf\nthe prices of our services compared to our competitors;\n\u25cf\ntechnological advances that allow customers to meet their needs with fewer infrastructure resources;\n\u25cf\nmergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base; and\n\u25cf\nreduction in our customers\u2019 spending levels.\nIf our customers do not renew their agreements with us or if they renew on less favorable terms, our revenue would decline and our business may suffer. Similarly, our customer agreements may provide for minimum commitments that may be significantly below our customers\u2019 historical usage levels. Consequently, these customers could significantly curtail their usage without incurring any incremental fees under our agreements. In this event, our revenue would be lower than expected and our operating results could suffer.\nWe have a long sales cycle for our IT infrastructure services and the implementation efforts required by customers to activate them can be substantial.\nOur IT infrastructure services are complex and require substantial sales efforts and technical consultation to implement. A customer\u2019s decision to outsource some or all of its IT infrastructure typically involves a significant commitment of resources. Some customers may be reluctant to purchase our services due to their inability to accurately forecast future demand, delay in decision-making or inability to obtain necessary internal approvals to commit resources. We may expend time and resources pursuing a particular sale or customer that does not result in revenue. Delays due to the length of our sales cycle may harm our ability to meet our forecasts and materially and adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nWe may lose customers if they elect to develop or maintain some or all of their IT infrastructure services internally.\nOur current and potential customers may decide to develop or maintain their own IT infrastructure rather than outsource to service providers like us. These in-house IT infrastructure services could be perceived to be superior or more cost effective compared to our services. If we fail to offer IT infrastructure services that compete favorably with in-sourced services or if we fail to differentiate our IT infrastructure services, we may lose customers or fail to attract customers that may consider pursuing this in-sourced approach, and our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations would suffer as a result.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 business models may change in ways that we do not anticipate and these changes could reduce or eliminate our customers\u2019 needs for our services. If this occurs, we could lose customers or potential customers, and our business and financial results would suffer. As a result of these or similar potential developments in the future, it is possible that competitive dynamics in our market may require us to reduce our prices, which could harm our revenue, gross margin and operating results.\nIf governments modify or increase regulation of the Internet, or goods or services necessary to operate the Internet or our IT infrastructure, our services could become more costly.\nInternational bodies and federal, state and local governments have adopted a number of laws and regulations that affect the Internet and are likely to continue to seek to implement additional laws and regulations. In addition, federal and state agencies have adopted or are actively considering regulation of various aspects of the Internet and/or IP services, including taxation of transactions, regulation of broadband providers and ISPs, enhanced data privacy and retention legislation and various energy regulations, as well as law enforcement surveillance and anti-terrorism initiatives targeting instant messaging applications, for example. Additionally, potential laws and regulations not specifically directed at the Internet, but targeted at goods or services necessary to operate the Internet, could have a negative impact on us. These factors may impact the delivery of our services by driving up the cost of power, which is a significant cost of operating our data centers and other service points.\nWe face the risk that the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) may regulate broadband Internet access services or that Congress or one or more states will approve legislation significantly affecting our Internet customers, and thus, our business. Beginning in 2010, the FCC adopted Open Internet rules which were vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in early 2014. Following another FCC rulemaking in 2014, at the time of preparation of this report, the FCC is scheduled to vote on FCC Chairman Wheeler\u2019s proposal for new \u201cOpen Internet\u201d rules, at the FCC\u2019s February 26, 2015 Open Meeting (\u201cOpen Meeting\u201d). The rules would include a potentially significant reclassification of broadband Internet access, and potentially, a classification of edge provider connections to broadband Internet access, both as regulated Title II \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d rather than deregulated information services, which broadband has historically been. Title II regulation would subject ISPs to common carrier regulation, including prohibiting \u201cunjust and unreasonable practices\u201d and discriminatory practices under Sections 201 and 202 of the Communications Act, regulation of consumer privacy under Section 222 and other common carrier regulation(s).\nAs \u201cbright line rules\u201d the proposed rules would prohibit (a) blocking, (b) throttling (impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or services), and (c) paid prioritization or \u201cfast lanes,\u201d including for ISP affiliates. The rules would allow for reasonable network management, which must be tailored to achieve a legitimate network management purpose, not a commercial one. The proposed rules would also enhance the transparency requirements for broadband services and would set a standard of conduct for ISPs. Under the proposed framework, the FCC would not enforce certain Title II provisions by forbearing from imposing, among other things, rate regulation and Universal Service contributions or \u201cany new taxes or fees\u201d on broadband providers, though an FCC Commissioner has issued a public statement in opposition. As such, there is lingering uncertainty about what the final approved rules will be, and whether the rules will make broadband more expensive for end users, which would impact Internap\u2019s customers and Internap\u2019s business. As of the preparation of this report, the comprehensive proposal has not been released, and further details, including possible changes to the Chairman\u2019s proposed rules prior to the February 26 vote, will likely emerge later. Litigation is almost certain, and at least one leading U.S. carrier and a major cable television trade association have announced that litigation challenges to the Open Internet rules are likely.\nWhile future actions are difficult to predict, the regulatory reclassification of broadband services as telecommunications services under Title II should directly benefit edge providers, though the as-yet uncertain impact on taxes, fees and other costs for broadband Internet access could negatively impact our customers and, in turn, impact our business. The same is true of any possible congressional rewrite of the Communications Act which results in new regulation of broadband providers as common carriers. Companies like ours, whose business involves providing enterprise networks for cloud computing and other Internet-based business applications, could have their operations and costs impacted by a top-to-bottom review of broadband access principles. On the other hand, it remains unclear what impact these new regulations will have on the costs that businesses like ours that pay for broadband access services will face in the absence of a statutory or regulatory prohibition. Any of these developments could significantly impact our business.\n- 8 -\nA recently proposed legislative amendment that Congress is considering to the Communications Act poses other potential risks. Senate and House Committees held hearings on January 21, 2015 to consider draft majority party legislation that would amend the Communications Act to expressly (a) classify broadband as an information service; (b) allow ISPs to offer \u201cspecialized services\u201d or \u201cservices other than broadband Internet access service that are offered over the same network\u201d; and (c) prohibit blocking of lawful content, throttling data and paid prioritization. The proposed legislative reforms would apply to both wireless and wireline broadband services. The draft legislation appears to be based on the FCC\u2019s Open Internet rules that were partially overturned by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in early 2014. If this proposed legislation or similar legislation is enacted which does not treat broadband Internet access or the service interconnecting Internet content edge providers with ISPs as a telecommunications service, it could disadvantage our edge provider customers and adversely impact our business.\nIn another pending rulemaking, the FCC is proposing to regulate Internet-based video programming providers as multi-channel video programming distributors (\u201cMVPDs\u201d) as it currently does established cable television providers and satellite providers. The FCC has tentatively concluded that the traditional definition of MVPD requiring ownership of the video transmission path should be expanded to a more flexible definition that would include Internet-based video programmers. As proposed, this new definition would apply to any provider of multiple streams of pre-scheduled programming, but not video on demand. There are a host of legal obligations imposed on and rights extended to MVPDs that currently do not apply to IP-based video distribution networks, including closed captioning, EEO and Emergency Alert System requirements. Conversely, there are rights to enter into good faith negotiations for retransmission consent agreements with broadcast networks that Internet-based video programmers would gain as MVPDs. The FCC has requested comments in March 2015. This proceeding could directly impact the ability to compete for video programming of a number of Internap\u2019s customers, and thereby impact the future use of Internap\u2019s services.\nIn addition, laws relating to the liability of private network operators and information carried on or disseminated through their networks are unsettled, both in the U.S. and abroad. The nature of any new laws and regulations and the interpretation of applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement, copyright, trademark, trade secret, national security, law enforcement, obscenity, libel, employment, personal privacy, consumer protection and other issues are uncertain and developing. We may become subject to legal claims such as defamation, invasion of privacy or copyright infringement in connection with content stored on or distributed through our network. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business.\nOne of our subsidiaries offers metro connect Ethernet data transmission services to customers colocated at our data centers to enable expanded connectivity. These are regulated telecommunications services, which require our subsidiary to obtain regulatory certification(s) and maintain an approved tariff in most states in which these services are offered. There are various regulatory compliance requirements to operate as a telecommunications carrier, such as the filing of tariffs, annual reports and universal service reports, all of which must be satisfied to continue to offer these services, and avoid any enforcement actions by federal or state regulators. We also must ensure that we are in compliance with state consumer protection laws in every state in which the subsidiary offers such services. Failure to comply with any of these requirements could negatively impact our business.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for key elements of our IT infrastructure services. If we are unable to obtain these elements on a cost-effective basis, or at all, or if such services are interrupted, limited or terminated, our growth prospects and business operations may be adversely affected.\nIn delivering our services, we rely on a number of Internet networks, many of which are built and operated by third parties. To provide high performance connectivity services through our network access points, we purchase connections from several ISPs. We can offer no assurances that these ISPs will continue to provide service to us on a cost-effective basis or on competitive terms, if at all, or that these providers will provide us with additional capacity to adequately meet customer demand or to expand our business. Consolidation among ISPs limits the number of vendors from which we obtain service, possibly resulting in higher network costs to us. We may be unable to establish and maintain relationships with other ISPs that may emerge or that are significant in geographic areas, such as Asia and Europe, in which we may locate our future network access points. Any of these situations could limit our growth prospects and materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe also depend on other companies to supply various key elements of our network infrastructure, including the network access loops between our network access points and our ISP, local loops between our network access points and our customers\u2019 networks and certain end-user access networks. Pricing for such network access loops and local loops has risen significantly over time and operators of these networks may take measures that could degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of our or our customers\u2019 access to certain of these end-user access networks by restricting or prohibiting the use of their networks to support or facilitate our services, or by charging increased fees. Some of our competitors have their own network access loops and local loops and are, therefore, not subject to similar availability and pricing issues.\n- 9 -\nFor data center and hosting facilities, we rely on a number of vendors to provide physical space, convert or build space to our specifications, provide power, internal cabling and wiring, climate control, physical security and system redundancy. We typically obtain physical space through long-term leases. We utilize multiple other vendors to perform leasehold improvements necessary to make the physical space available for occupancy. The demand for premium data center and hosting space in several key markets has outpaced supply over recent years and the imbalance is projected to continue over the near term. This has limited our physical space options and increased, and will continue to increase, our costs to add capacity. If we are not able to procure space through renewing our existing leases or entering into new leases, or are not able to contain costs for physical space, or are not able to pass these costs on to our customers, our results will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we currently purchase infrastructure equipment such as servers, routers, switches and storage components from a limited number of vendors. We do not carry significant inventories of the equipment we purchase, and we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our vendors. A loss of a significant vendor could delay any build-out of our infrastructure and increase our costs. If our limited source of suppliers fails to provide products or services that comply with evolving Internet standards or that interoperate with other products or services we use in our network infrastructure, we may be unable to meet all or a portion of our customer service commitments, which could materially and adversely affect our results.\nAny failure of our physical IT infrastructure could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business reputation, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on providing customers with highly-reliable service. We must protect our IT infrastructure and our customers\u2019 data and their equipment located in our data centers. The services we provide in each of our data centers are subject to failure resulting from numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\nhuman error;\n\u25cf\nphysical or electronic security breaches;\n\u25cf\nfire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, tornado and other natural disasters;\n\u25cf\nimproper maintenance of the buildings in which our data centers are located;\n\u25cf\nwater damage, extreme temperatures, fiber cuts;\n\u25cf\npower loss or equipment failure;\n\u25cf\nsabotage and vandalism; and\n\u25cf\nfailures experienced by underlying service providers upon which our business relies.\nProblems at one or more of our company-controlled facilities or our partner sites, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant equipment damage. Most of our customers have SLAs that require us to meet minimum performance obligations and to provide service credits to customers if we do not meet those obligations. If a service interruption impacts a significant portion of our customer base, the amount of service credits we are required to provide could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Also, if we experience a service interruption and we fail to provide a service credit under an SLA, we could face claims related to such failures, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Because our data centers are critical to our customers\u2019 businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers also could result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. We cannot guarantee that a court would enforce any contractual limitations on our liability in the event that a customer brings a lawsuit against us as the result of a problem at one of our data centers.\nAny loss of services, equipment damage or inability to meet performance obligations in our SLAs could reduce the confidence of our customers and could result in lost customers or an inability to attract new customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results.\nFurthermore, we are dependent upon ISPs and telecommunications carriers in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific region, some of whom have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past. Users of our services may experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and services. If, for any reason, these providers fail to provide the required services, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur business operations depend on contracts with vendors and suppliers who may not meet their contractual obligations.\nTracking, monitoring and managing our contracts and vendor relationships is critical to our business operations; however, we have limited control over the vendors\u2019 performance of these contracts. Even if these contracts contain terms favorable to us in the event of a breach, there is no guarantee the damages due us under the contract would cover the losses suffered or would even be paid. Also, each contract contains specific terms and conditions that may change over time based on contract expiration, assignment, assumption or renegotiation. There is no guarantee that these changes would be favorable to us, and to the event they were not, our operations could be materially impacted.\n- 10 -\nThese contracts may contain provisions that result in favorable or non-favorable impacts on us depending on actions taken, or not taken. While we would normally pursue all contractual provisions favorable to our business, the appropriate actions under a particular contract may require estimates, judgments and assumptions to be made concerning future events for which we have limited basis for estimation. We cannot guarantee that we will take the appropriate action under a particular contract to maximize the benefit to us, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.\nIn addition, we license intellectual property rights from third-party owners. If such owners do not properly maintain or enforce the intellectual property underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects could be harmed. Our licensors may fail to maintain these patents or intellectual property registrations, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or intellectual property registrations or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would.\nOur inability to renew our data center leases, or renew on favorable terms, and potential unknown costs related to asset retirement obligations could negatively impact our financial results.\nGenerally, our company-controlled data center leases provide us with the opportunity to renew the leases at our option for periods typically ranging from five to 10 years. Many of these options however, if renewed, provide that rent for the renewal period will be the fair market rental rate at the time of renewal. If the fair market rental rates are significantly higher than our current rental rates, we may be unable to offset these costs by charging more for our services, which could have a negative impact on our financial results. Conversely, if rental rates drop significantly in the near term, we would not be able to take advantage of the drop in rates until the expiration of the lease as we would be bound by the terms of the existing lease.\nFor the leases that do not contain renewal options, or for which the option to renew has been exhausted or passed, we cannot guarantee the lessor will renew the lease, or will do so at a rate that will allow us to maintain profitability on that particular space. While we proactively monitor these leases, and conduct on-going negotiations with lessors, our ability to renegotiate renewals is inherently limited by the original contract language, including option renewal clauses. If we are unable to renew, we may incur substantial costs to move our infrastructure and/or customers and to restore the property to its required condition, there is no guarantee that our customers will move with us and we may not be able to find appropriate and sufficient space. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we have capital lease agreements that require us to decommission the physical space for which we have not yet recorded an asset retirement obligation (\u201cARO\u201d). Due to the uncertainty of specific decommissioning obligations, timing and related costs, an ARO is not reasonably estimable for these properties and we have not recorded a liability at this time for such properties.\nA failure in the redundancies in one or more of our NOCs, P-NAPs or computer systems could cause a significant disruption in Internet connectivity which could impact our ability to serve our customers.\nWhile we maintain multiple layers of redundancy in our operating facilities, if we experience a problem at one or more of our NOCs, including the failure of redundant systems, we may be unable to provide Internet connectivity services to our customers, provide customer service and support or monitor our network infrastructure or P-NAPs, any of which would seriously harm our business and operating results. Also, because we are obligated to provide continuous Internet availability under our SLAs, we may be required to issue a significant amount of service credits as a result of such interruptions in service. These credits could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, interruptions in service to our customers could potentially harm our customer relations, expose us to potential lawsuits or necessitate additional capital expenditures.\nA significant number of our P-NAPs are located in facilities owned and operated by third parties. In many of those arrangements, we do not have property rights similar to those customarily possessed by a lessee or subtenant but instead have lesser rights of occupancy. In certain situations, the financial condition of those parties providing occupancy to us could have an adverse impact on the continued occupancy arrangement or the level of service delivered to us under such arrangements.\nOur business could be harmed by prolonged electrical power outages or shortages, increased costs of energy or general availability of electrical resources.\nOur IT infrastructure services are susceptible to regional costs and supply of power, electrical power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages and availability of adequate power resources. Power outages could harm our customers and our business. While we attempt to limit exposure to system downtime by using backup generators, uninterruptible power systems and other redundancies, we may not be able to limit our exposure entirely. Even with these protections in place we have experienced power outages in the past and may in the future. In addition, our energy costs have increased and may continue to increase for a variety of reasons including increased pressure on legislators to pass green legislation. As energy costs increase, we may not be able to pass on to our customers the increased cost of energy, which could harm our business and operating results.\n- 11 -\nIn each of our markets, we rely on utility companies to provide a sufficient amount of power for current and future customers. We cannot ensure that these third parties will deliver such power in adequate quantities or on a consistent basis. At the same time, power and cooling requirements are growing on a per-unit basis. As a result, some customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per square foot of space utilized. Inability to increase power capacity to meet increased customer demands would limit our ability to grow our business, which could have a negative impact on our relationships with our customers and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur network and software are subject to potential security breaches and similar threats that could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nA number of widespread and disabling attacks on public and private networks have occurred. The number and severity of these attacks may increase in the future as network assailants take advantage of outdated software, security breaches or incompatibility between or among networks. Computer viruses, intrusions and similar disruptive problems could cause us to be liable for damages under agreements with our customers and fines and penalties to governmental or regulatory agencies, and our reputation could suffer, thereby resulting in a loss of current customers and deterring potential customers from working with us. Security problems or other attacks caused by third parties could lead to interruptions and delays or to the cessation of service to our customers. Furthermore, inappropriate use of the network by third parties could also jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems and in those of our customers and could expose us to liability under unsolicited commercial e-mail, or \u201cspam,\u201d regulations. In the past, third parties have occasionally circumvented some of these industry-standard measures. We can offer no assurance that the measures we implement will not be circumvented. Our efforts to eliminate computer viruses and alleviate other security problems, or any circumvention of those efforts, may result in increased costs, interruptions, delays or cessation of service to our customers and negatively impact hosted customers\u2019 on-line business transactions. Affected customers might file claims against us under such circumstances, and our insurance may not be available or adequate to cover these claims.\nThe increased use of high-power density equipment may limit our ability to fully utilize our data centers.\nCustomers continue to increase their use of high-power density equipment, which has significantly increased the demand for power. The current demand for electrical power may exceed our designed capacity in certain facilities. As electrical power, rather than space, is typically the primary factor limiting capacity in our data centers, our ability to fully utilize our data centers may be limited in these facilities. If we are unable to adequately utilize our data centers, our ability to grow our business cost-effectively could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business requires the continued development of effective and efficient business support systems to support our customer growth and related services.\nThe growth of our business depends on our ability to continue to develop and successfully implement effective and efficient business support policies, processes and internal systems. This is a complicated undertaking requiring significant resources and expertise. Business support systems are needed for:\n\u25cf\nsourcing, evaluating and targeting potential customers and managing existing customers;\n\u25cf\nimplementing customer orders for services;\n\u25cf\ndelivering these services;\n\u25cf\ntimely billing for these services;\n\u25cf\nbudgeting, forecasting, tracking and reporting our results of operations; and\n\u25cf\nproviding technical and operational support to customers and tracking the resolution of customer issues.\nIf the number of customers that we serve or our services portfolio increases, we may need to develop additional business support systems on a schedule sufficient to meet proposed service rollout dates. The failure to continue to develop effective and efficient business support systems, and update or optimize these systems to a level commensurate with the needs of our business and/or our competition, could harm our ability to implement our business plans, maintain competitiveness and meet our financial goals and objectives.\nWe depend upon our key employees and may be unable to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified personnel.\nOur future performance depends upon the continued contributions of our executive management team and other key employees. To the extent we are able to expand our operations, we may need to increase our workforce. Accordingly, our future success depends on our ability to attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled management, technical, sales, research and development, marketing and customer support personnel. Competition for qualified employees is intense, and we compete for qualified employees with companies that may have greater financial resources than we have. We may not be successful in attracting, hiring and retaining the people we need, which would seriously impede our ability to implement our business strategy.\n- 12 -\nAdditionally, changes in our senior management team during the past several years, both through voluntary and involuntary separation, have resulted in loss of valuable company intellectual capital and in paying significant severance and hiring costs. With reduced staffing, or staffing new to the organization, we may not be able to maintain an adequate separation of duties in key areas of monitoring, oversight and review functions and may not have adequate succession plans in place to mitigate the impact of future personnel losses. If we continue to experience similar levels of turnover in our senior management team, the execution of our corporate strategy could be affected and the costs and effects of such changes could negatively impact our operations.\nOur global operations may not be successful.\nWe have limited experience operating globally and have only recently begun to achieve some success in our global operations. We currently have locations in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, Montreal, Paris, Singapore, Sydney and Toronto. We also participate in a joint venture with NTT-ME Corporation and NTT Holdings, which operates network access points in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan. We may develop or acquire P-NAPs or complementary businesses in additional global markets. The risks associated with expansion of our global business operations include:\n\u25cf\nchallenges in establishing and maintaining relationships with global customers, ISPs and local vendors, including data center and local network operators;\n\u25cf\nchallenges in staffing and managing NOCs and P-NAPs across disparate geographic areas;\n\u25cf\npotential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than the laws in the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nchallenges in reducing operating expense or other costs required by local laws and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf\nexposure to fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf\ncosts of customizing P-NAPs for foreign countries and customers; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance with requirements of foreign laws, regulations and other governmental controls, including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that may reduce the flexibility of our business operations or favor local competition.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to address the risks associated with our global operations, which may limit our sales growth and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may acquire other businesses, and these acquisitions involve integration and other risks that could harm our business.\nWe may pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, services and technologies to expand our geographic footprint, enhance our existing services, expand our service offerings or enlarge our customer base. If we complete future acquisitions, we may be required to incur or assume additional debt, make capital expenditures or issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock as consideration, which would dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interest and may adversely affect our results of operations. If we fail to identify and acquire needed companies or assets, if we acquire the wrong companies or assets, if we fail to address the risks associated with integrating an acquired company or if we do not successfully integrate an acquired company, we would not be able to effectively manage our growth through acquisitions which could adversely affect our results.\nIn this regard, our acquisition of iWeb in late 2013 may not provide all of the benefits we anticipate and we may not be successful in our integration of iWeb, either of which could negatively impact our business.\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock and Other Business Risks\nWe have a history of losses and may not sustain profitability.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred net losses of $39.5 million, $19.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $1.1 billion. Given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability, and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, including our ability to raise additional funds.\nFailure to sustain our revenues will cause our business and financial results to suffer.\nWe have considerable fixed expenses, and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses, particularly with the expansion of our data center facilities. We incur a substantial portion of these expenditures upfront, and are only able to recover these costs over time. Therefore, we must at least sustain revenues to maintain profitability.\n- 13 -\nNumerous factors could affect our ability to sustain revenue, either alone or in combination with other factors, including:\n\u25cf\nfailure to sustain sales of our services;\n\u25cf\npricing pressures;\n\u25cf\nsignificant increases in cost of goods sold or other operating expenses;\n\u25cf\nfailure of our services to operate as expected;\n\u25cf\nloss of customers or inability to attract new customers or loss of existing customers at a rate greater than our increase in new customers;\n\u25cf\ncustomers\u2019 failure to pay on a timely basis or at all or failure to continue to purchase our IT infrastructure services in accordance with their contractual commitments; or\n\u25cf\nnetwork failures and any breach or unauthorized access to our network.\nOur results of operations have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to fluctuate, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis. Fluctuation in our operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We expect to experience continued fluctuations in our operating results in the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ncompetition and the introduction of new services by our competitors;\n\u25cf\ncontinued pricing pressures;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the demand and sales cycle for our services;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the market for qualified sales and other personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe cost and availability of adequate public utilities, including power;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain local loop connections to our P-NAPs at favorable prices;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions; and\n\u25cf\nany impairments or restructurings charges that we may incur in the future.\nIn addition, fluctuations in our results of operations may arise from strategic decisions we have made or may make with respect to the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures such as those associated with the expansion of our data center facilities, the deployment of additional P-NAPs, the terms of our network connectivity purchase agreements and the cost of servers, storage and other equipment necessary to deploy hosting and cloud services. A relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to lease and personnel expense, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. Our results of operations, therefore, are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenue. We can offer no assurance that the results of any particular period are an indication of future performance in our business operations. Fluctuations in our results of operations could have a negative impact on our ability to raise additional capital and execute our business plan.\nWe may incur additional goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring charges or both.\nThe assumptions, inputs and judgments used in performing the valuation analysis and assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets are inherently subjective and reflect estimates based on known facts and circumstances at the time the valuation is performed. The use of different assumptions, inputs and judgments or changes in circumstances could materially affect the results of the valuation and assessments. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from our estimates.\nWhen circumstances warrant, we may elect to exit certain business activities or change the manner in which we conduct ongoing operations. When we make such a change, we will estimate the costs to exit a business or restructure ongoing operations. The components of the estimates may include estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and costs of future events and activities that represent our best expectations based on known facts and circumstances at the time of estimation. Should circumstances warrant, we will adjust our previous estimates to reflect what we then believe to be a more accurate representation of expected future costs. Because our estimates and assumptions regarding impairment and restructuring charges include probabilities of future events, such as expected operating results, future economic conditions, the ability to find a sublease tenant within a reasonable period of time or the rate at which a sublease tenant will pay for the available space, such estimates are inherently vulnerable to changes due to unforeseen circumstances that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Adverse changes in any of these factors could result in an additional impairment and restructuring charges in the future.\n- 14 -\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market for our equity securities has been extremely volatile. Our stock price could suffer in the future as a result of any failure to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors about our results of operations from quarter to quarter. The following factors could cause the price of our common stock in the public market to fluctuate significantly:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly and annual results of operations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations of companies in the industries in which we may compete;\n\u25cf\nchanges in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u25cf\nfuture issuances of common stock or other securities;\n\u25cf\nthe addition or departure of key personnel; and\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances.\nOur stockholders may experience significant dilution, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nHolders of our stock options may exercise those options to purchase our common stock, which would increase the number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding in the future. As of December 31, 2014, options to purchase an aggregate of 5.9 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $7.07 were outstanding. Also, the vesting of 0.8 million outstanding shares of restricted stock will increase the weighted average number of shares used for calculating diluted net loss per share. Greater than expected capital requirements could require us to obtain additional financing through the issuance of securities, which could be in the form of common stock or preferred stock or other securities having greater rights than our common stock. The issuance of our common stock or other securities, whether upon the exercise of options, the future vesting and issuance of stock awards to our executives and employees, in financing transactions or otherwise, could depress the market price of our common stock by increasing the number of shares of common stock or other securities outstanding on an absolute basis or as a result of the timing of additional shares of common stock becoming available on the market.\nOur existing credit agreement places certain limitations on us.\nOur existing credit agreement requires us to meet certain financial covenants related to maximum total leverage ratio, minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and limitation on capital expenditures, as well as negative and reporting covenants. In addition, these covenants create liens on a majority our assets. If we do not satisfy these covenants, we would be in default under the credit agreement. Any defaults, if not waived, could result in our lenders ceasing to make loans or extending credit to us, accelerating or declaring all or any obligations immediately due or taking possession of or liquidating collateral. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the credit agreement on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could materially and adversely impact our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, our ability to access the capital markets may be limited at a time when we would like or need to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to pursue expansion opportunities and maintain our desired level of revenue growth in the future.\nAny failure to meet our debt obligations and other long-term commitments would damage our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total debt, including capital leases, was $367.1 million. If we use more cash than we generate in the future, our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. In addition, if we are unable to make interest or principal payments when due, we would be in default under the terms of our long-term debt obligations, which would result in all principal and interest becoming due and payable which, in turn, would seriously harm our business.\nWe also have other long-term commitments for operating leases and service and purchase contracts totaling $130.5 million in the future with a minimum of $43.3 million payable in 2015. If we are unable to make payments when due, we would be in breach of contractual terms of the agreements, which may result in disruptions of our services which, in turn, would seriously harm our business.\nOur ability to use U.S. net operating loss carryforwards might be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $208.8 million for U.S. federal tax purposes. These loss carryforwards expire between 2018 and 2034. To the extent these net operating loss carryforwards are available, we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. To the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited, our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, which could result in lower profits.\n- 15 -\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may lose rights to some of our most valuable assets.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property law, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our proprietary rights. We also utilize unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets and employ various methods to protect such intellectual property. We believe our intellectual property rights are significant and that the loss of all or a substantial portion of such rights could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We can offer no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or that our trade secrets will not become known or be independently discovered by competitors. In addition, the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. From time-to-time, third parties have or may assert infringement claims against us or against our customers in connection with their use of our products or services.\nIn addition, we rely on the intellectual property of others. We may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from these other parties to further develop and market commercially-viable products or services effectively. We can offer no assurance that any necessary licenses will be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nChanges to conform to new accounting principles and/or financial regulation may be costly and disrupt our current planning, analysis and reporting processes.\nAccounting oversight bodies in the U.S. and internationally are actively contemplating and enacting a number of new accounting regulations. To comply with these changes, we may need to incur a significant amount of time and resources to adapt personnel, processes, reporting and systems. The newly issued guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d) provides a single model for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance and, while still under our review, could significantly change our results of operations and related disclosures. Likewise, changes proposed to current lease accounting guidance under GAAP would require reclassification of most of our operating leases to capital lease treatment and would significantly change the nature of our balance sheet.\nIn addition, laws relating to public company governance practices, such as the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which is being implemented over time, have modified existing corporate governance practices and potentially increase liability related to stockholder actions, whistleblower claims and governmental enforcement actions.\nWhile we have implemented internal practices to proactively review, assess and adapt to constantly changing regulations, we cannot predict with certainty the impact, if any, that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business or the potential costs we may incur related to compliance with new laws and regulations.\nWe may face litigation and liability due to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights and due to our customers\u2019 use of our IT infrastructure services.\nThe IT infrastructure services industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. From time-to-time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. Any claims that our IT infrastructure services infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could significantly impact our operating results. In addition, our customer agreements generally require us to indemnify our customers for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringement of patents or copyrights of third parties, subject to certain limitations. If an infringement claim against us were to be successful, and we were not able to obtain a license to the relevant technology or a substitute technology on acceptable terms or redesign our services or products to avoid infringement, our ability to compete successfully in our market would be materially impaired.\nIn addition, our customers use our IT infrastructure services to operate and run certain aspects and functions of their businesses. From time-to-time, third parties may assert that our customers\u2019 businesses, including the business aspects and functions for which they use our IT infrastructure services, infringe patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or legal rights. Our customers\u2019 businesses may also be subject to regulatory oversight, governmental investigation, data breaches and lawsuits by their customers, competitors or other third parties based on a broad range of legal theories. Such third parties may seek to hold us liable on the basis of contributory or vicarious liability or other legal theories. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could significantly impact our operating results. If any such claim against us were to be successful, damages could be significant and our ability to compete successfully in our market would be materially impaired.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock, and investors would only be able to receive cash in respect of the shares of common stock upon the sale of their shares.\nWe have no intention in the foreseeable future to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, and the covenants in our credit agreement limit our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, an investor in our common stock may obtain an economic benefit from the common stock only after an increase in its trading price and only by selling the common stock.\n- 16 -\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and provisions of Delaware law, could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company. These provisions are intended to protect stockholders\u2019 interests by providing our board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a board of directors that is classified so that only one-third of directors stand for election each year. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.", "PERMNO": 87236, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "INAPQ"}
