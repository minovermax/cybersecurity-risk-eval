RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results. In addition, we may be adversely affected by risks that we currently deem immaterial or by other risks that are not currently known to us. You should carefully consider these risks before making an investment decision. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing the risks described below, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Products, Programs and Operations\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize Omidria, or any of our product candidates, if approved, our inability to generate significant revenue from the sales of Omidria or approved product candidates would adversely impact our ability to achieve profitability.\nOmidria\u2122 (phenylephrine and ketorolac injection) 1%/0.3% is our only product that has been approved by the FDA for commercial sale in the U.S. and we have not yet generated any significant revenue from any product sales to date. We may not be able to successfully commercialize Omidria or any other product candidate, if approved, for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\na lack of acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers and other members of the medical community;\n\u2022\nour limited experience in marketing, selling and distributing Omidria or any other product;\n\u2022\nour limited experience managing third-party commercial manufacturing of Omidria or any other product;\n\u2022\nour reliance on a limited number of manufacturers and a limited number of suppliers of the product\u2019s active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients and packaging materials;\n\u2022\nreimbursement and coverage policies of government and private payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, group purchasing organizations, insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators;\n\u2022\nthe availability, relative price and efficacy of the product as compared to alternative treatment options or competing products;\n\u2022\nan unknown safety risk of Omidria or any other product;\n\u2022\nthe failure to obtain regulatory approval, including for Omidria in the EU or other foreign territories;\n\u2022\nchanged or increased regulatory restrictions in the U.S., EU and other foreign territories; and\n\u2022\na lack of adequate financial or other resources to commercialize the product successfully.\nIf we are not able to successfully commercialize Omidria or any other product candidate, if approved, for these or other reasons, our ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability will be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nOur operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate. If our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our stock could decline.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for Omidria;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which coverage and reimbursement for Omidria is available from government and private third-party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, insurance companies, group purchasing organizations, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators;\n\u2022\nthe duration of transitional pass-through reimbursement status from CMS for Omidria and the continued availability of separate reimbursement once transitional pass-through reimbursement expires;\n\u2022\nthe timing, cost and level of investment in our sales and marketing efforts to support Omidria sales;\n\u2022\nthe timing, cost and level of investment in our research and development activities involving Omidria and our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of conducting required post-approval studies for Omidria and expenditures we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional technologies, products and product candidates.\nFurther, the number of procedures in which Omidria would be used, or the size of the market in which any other of our products would be used, if commercialized, may be significantly less than the total number of such procedures performed or total possible market size. Our revenues may also depend on commercial arrangements, development funding and the achievement of development and clinical milestones under collaboration and license agreements that we may enter into from time to time in the future. These upfront and milestone payments may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and any such variance could cause a significant fluctuation in our operating results from one quarter to the next.\nIf we do not have adequate reimbursement from governments or other third-party payers for Omidria or any other approved product that we may develop, or if we do not establish and maintain market-acceptable pricing for Omidria or those approved products, they may not be purchased or used and, as a result, our prospects for revenue and profitability could suffer.\nOur future revenue and profit will depend heavily on the pricing and availability of adequate reimbursement for the use of our approved products, including Omidria, from governmental and other third-party payers, both in the U.S. and in other countries. Even if we are successful in bringing one or more products to market, these products may not be considered cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for any product may be insufficient to allow us to sell the product profitably. Reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend on a number of factors, including the third-party payer\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022\nsafe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022\ncost-effective; and\n\u2022\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining reimbursement approval for any product from each government or third-party payer can be a time-consuming and costly process that will require the build-out of a sufficient staff or the engagement of third parties and could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our approved products to each payer. We can provide no assurances at this time regarding the cost-effectiveness of Omidria or any of our product candidates. Further, we can provide no assurance that the amounts, if any, reimbursed to surgical facilities for utilization of any of our surgery-related products, including Omidria, or product candidates or to surgeons for the administration and delivery of these products or product candidates will be considered adequate to justify the use of these products or product candidates. Even if one payer adopts a favorable reimbursement methodology for Omidria or any of our product candidates, if commercialized, there is no guarantee that other third-party payers will adopt the same methodology. For example, other third-party payers often follow, but are not required to follow, the reimbursement methodology adopted by CMS.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved products, and we may not be able to provide data sufficient be granted reimbursement. Even when a payer determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, coverage may be limited to the uses of a product that are either approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies and/or appear in a recognized drug compendium, and other conditions may apply. Increasingly, third-party payers who reimburse healthcare costs, such as government and private payers, are requiring that companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and challenging the prices charged for medical products. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not mean that any product will be reimbursed at a rate that allows us to make a profit in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacturing, sales and distribution. Even if we receive reimbursement for a product, the initial rate or method at which the product will be reimbursed could become unfavorable to us at the time reimbursement is initiated or in the future. In addition, pass-through reimbursement status is usually granted for a limited duration and we expect pass-through reimbursement status for Omidria to last until December 31, 2017. After pass-through reimbursement status expires, we may not be able to maintain or obtain separate reimbursement for Omidria.\nIn non-U.S. jurisdictions, we must obtain separate reimbursement approvals and comply with related foreign legal and regulatory requirements. In some countries, including those in the EU, our products may be subject to government price controls. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take a considerable amount of time and expenditure of resources after the receipt of marketing approval for a product.\nIf the reimbursement that we are able to obtain and maintain for any product that we develop, including Omidria, is inadequate in light of our development and other costs or is significantly delayed, our business could be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to market and successfully sell Omidria or our product candidates, if approved, we may be unable to generate product revenue.\nOmeros has never sold, marketed or distributed any product. Developing a sales force for any product is expensive and time-consuming, and a delay in hiring and training a sales force, or difficulties managing a contract sales force, could impact the timing or effectiveness of any product launch. We have entered into an agreement with inVentiv for a field sales force and related sales operation services for the U.S. commercial launch of Omidria but we have no experience operating or managing a third-party sales force for any product. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize any approved products, including Omidria, without commercialization partners include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit in a timely manner, and retain, adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel, or to partner or contract with a third party to provide sales and marketing services, in the applicable region of the world;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to sell or promote any approved product(s) to adequate numbers of hospitals, surgery centers, physicians and/or pharmacists;\n\u2022\nour inability to develop and maintain, or access, adequate information systems to monitor sales by distribution channel, report pricing, maintain customer lists and track selling and marketing operations;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating a sales and marketing organization; and\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain agreements with distributors on commercially reasonable terms.\nIf we are unsuccessful in building and managing a sales and marketing infrastructure internally or through a third-party partner for any approved product, we will have difficulty commercializing the product, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn the EU, we plan to enter into partnerships for Omidria marketing and distribution with one or more third parties. Outside of the U.S. and EU, we are exploring potential regional partnerships to make Omidria available to ophthalmologists. We have not yet entered into any agreements with third parties to market Omidria outside of the U.S. Even if we obtain approvals from relevant government authorities in one or more non-U.S. territories, we would not expect to see sales of Omidria in those territories if we are unable to enter into such agreements on terms acceptable to us, if at all, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, including the regulations associated with approval for marketing of Omidria and our product candidates.\nBoth before and after approval of any product, we and our suppliers, contract manufacturers and clinical investigators are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries, covering, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, clinical trials, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, and import and export. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in, among other things, one or more of the following actions: warning letters; unanticipated expenditures; delays in approval or refusal to approve a product candidate; product recall or seizure; interruption of manufacturing or clinical trials; operating or marketing restrictions; injunctions; criminal prosecution and civil or criminal penalties including fines and other monetary penalties. We, the FDA or an independent Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee may suspend or terminate human clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are or would be exposed to an unacceptable health risk or because of the way in which the investigators on which we rely carry out the trials.\nObtaining FDA approval of our product candidates requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and may be subject to both expected and unforeseen delays, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on any of our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe FDA may decide that our data are insufficient for approval of our product candidates and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies or additional work related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls. For example, we have\nhad to suspend clinical trials of OMS824 based on a nonclinical finding, and the FDA has required that we review and further evaluate our nonclinical data before the FDA may permit us to resume or initiate further clinical trials in our OMS824 Huntington\u2019s and schizophrenia clinical programs. If, based on our review and evaluation of these data, the FDA concludes that there is an unwarranted safety risk to patients, the FDA may require us to run additional nonclinical studies before permitting us to resume or initiate additional clinical trials, may impose limits on such trials or may not permit us to resume or initiate clinical trials at all. As we develop our product candidates, we periodically discuss with the FDA clinical, regulatory and manufacturing matters, and our views may, at times, differ from those of the FDA. If we are unable to resolve questions raised by the FDA, we may be required to provide additional information, which may necessitate additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond that which we currently contemplate for regulatory approval, if we are unable to complete successfully our clinical trials or other testing, or if the results of these and other trials or tests fail to demonstrate efficacy or raise safety concerns, we may face substantial additional expenses, be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates or may never obtain marketing approval.\nEven if regulatory approval of a product candidate is obtained such approval may be subject to significant limitations on the indicated uses for which that product may be marketed, conditions of use, and/or significant post approval obligations, including additional post-marketing studies and clinical trials. These regulatory requirements may, among other things, limit the size of the market for the approved product. Even after approval, discovery of previously unknown problems with an approved product, manufacturer, or facility, such as previously undiscovered side effects or adverse effects or a manufacturer\u2019s failure to file current cGMPs, may result in restrictions on any product, manufacturer, or facility, including, among other things, a possible withdrawal of approval of the approved product. The realization of any of these risks could harm our business and operating results.\nThe commercialization of Omidria and our product candidates, if approved, is subject to extensive regulation and oversight under a number of different healthcare compliance laws. Compliance with these requirements requires the expenditure of substantial resources and attention, and the failure to comply with these requirements could result in criminal penalties, substantial fines or other civil penalties.\nIn the United States, the commercialization of Omidria and our product candidates, if approved, is subject to regulation and enforcement under a number of federal and state healthcare compliance laws. For example, the FDCA and its implementing regulations require that we advertise and promote our approved products only for uses that FDA has approved and for which we provide appropriate information about safety risks to balance information presented about product effectiveness, and that any product claims be adequately substantiated. The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits offering or paying anything of value to a person or entity to induce the use of a good or service covered by a federal health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The federal False Claims Act prohibits presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment by a federal health care program, and this law has been interpreted to include claims caused by improper drug-manufacturer product promotion or the payment of kickbacks. We are subject to a variety of governmental pricing, price reporting, and rebate requirements, including those under Medicaid and the Veterans Health Care Act. Under the so-called Sunshine Act and related provisions of the Affordable Care Act, we must report to the federal government information on financial payments we make to physicians and certain health care institutions and also on drug samples that we distribute. In addition to these federal law requirements, there are related state law requirements, including some laws that restrict our interactions with physicians and other providers. Also, if we receive protected patient health information, we may be subject to federal or state privacy laws.\nSimilar requirements apply to our operations outside the United States. United States laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibit the offering or payment of bribes or inducements to foreign public officials, including potentially physicians or other medical professionals who are employees of public health care entities. In addition, many countries have their own laws similar to the health-care compliance laws that exist in the United States.\nIn order to comply with these United States and other laws, we must establish and maintain an effective healthcare compliance program. In addition, some states mandate that we have a compliance program in place. Implementing an effective compliance program requires the expenditure of significant time and resources. If we are found to be in violation of any of these laws, there could be considerable civil or criminal penalties. In addition, if government enforcement authorities initiate an investigation into potential violations of these laws, we would be required to expend considerable resources and face adverse publicity and the potential disruption of our business, even if we are ultimately found not to have committed a violation.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of Omidria and our product candidates or to continue our other preclinical development programs.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since we were incorporated in June 1994. We had net losses of approximately $73.7 million, $39.8 million and $38.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $328.0 million. We do not anticipate generating significant revenue from the sale of Omidria until the second half of 2015 at the earliest and expect to continue to incur additional losses and cannot be certain that we will achieve profitability for some time, if at all. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to:\n\u2022\ncontinue the commercialization of Omidria;\n\u2022\ncontinue research and development in all of our programs;\n\u2022\nmake principal and interest payments when due under the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement;\n\u2022\ninitiate and conduct clinical trials for other programs and product candidates; and\n\u2022\ncommercialize and launch any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval.\nIf we do not raise additional capital when needed through one or more funding avenues, such as corporate partnering or debt or equity financings, we may be unable to complete these tasks successfully, or at all, which could prevent us from generating sales revenue or limit the amount of sales revenue generated. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, our business and prospects could be harmed and our stock price could decline significantly.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products internationally.\nWe intend to have Omidria and our product candidates, if approved, marketed outside the U.S. In order to market our products in the EU and many other non-U.S. jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The regulatory approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing and data review. The requirements governing marketing authorization, the conduct of clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. The time required to obtain regulatory approval outside the U.S. may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval discussed in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, or at all. Approval by the FDA or European Commission does not ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other foreign countries or by the FDA or European Commission. The failure to obtain regulatory approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions, or any delays in the regulatory process, could harm our business.\nWe have submitted an MAA to the EMA for Omidria, which is currently under review. The EU regulatory process is subject to substantial agency discretion and risks, including those described elsewhere in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d The EMA may decide not to give a positive opinion on our application, or may require us to obtain additional data regarding Omidria and to resubmit our MAA in order to consider Omidria for approval, further delaying our ability to market and generate revenue from the sale of Omidria in the EU. If there are any negative decisions or delays in the regulatory process, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nWe cannot be certain that OMS103 will receive regulatory approval.\nOur Phase 3 clinical program evaluating OMS103 in patients undergoing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy may be redesigned to include postoperative pain reduction as the primary endpoint before further clinical studies are conducted, if we elect to conduct additional OMS103 trials. While OMS103 demonstrated a drug effect in the first Phase 3 clinical trial by reducing early postoperative pain, which was a secondary endpoint, we can provide no assurance that in subsequent trials, OMS103 will meet the primary endpoint of early postoperative pain reduction or that the design of our Phase 3 program will be acceptable to regulatory authorities. Also, we can provide no assurances that we will have sufficient resources to conduct any subsequent clinical trials that we or regulatory authorities may deem necessary, including any trial regulatory authorities require to show a contribution from each drug in the OMS103 combination. If the data from any subsequent trials are negative or if our program design, data analysis, and proposed label claims are not acceptable to regulatory authorities, we may be unable to seek, or be significantly delayed in seeking, marketing approval of OMS103, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nWe have no internal capacity to manufacture clinical or commercial supplies of Omidria or our product candidates and intend to rely solely on third-party manufacturers.\nWe intend to rely on third party manufactures to produce commercial quantities of Omidria and any of our product candidates should they receive regulatory approval. Additionally, we intend to rely on third parties to produce clinical drug supplies needed for clinical trials. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to enter into these types of arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we or the manufacturer were to terminate one of these arrangements early, we would be required to transfer the manufacture to an approved alternative facility. Even if we are able to establish additional or replacement manufacturers, identifying these sources and entering into definitive supply agreements and obtaining regulatory approvals may require a substantial amount of time and cost and may create a shortage of the product. Such alternate supply arrangements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Additionally, if we are unable to engage multiple suppliers to manufacture our products, we may have inadequate supply to meet the demand of our product. Any significant delays in the manufacture of clinical or commercial supplies could materially harm our business and prospects.\nIf the contract manufacturers that we rely on experience difficulties manufacturing Omidria or our product candidates or fail FDA or other regulatory inspections, our clinical trials, regulatory submissions and ability to sell Omidria and our product candidates and generate revenue may be significantly delayed.\nContract manufacturers that we select to manufacture Omidria or our product candidates for clinical testing or for commercial supply may encounter difficulties with the small- and large-scale formulation and manufacturing processes required for such manufacture. These difficulties could result in delays in clinical trials, regulatory submissions, or impact the commercialization of our products and product candidates. Once a product is approved and being marketed, these difficulties could also result in the recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or failure to have adequate supplies to meet market demand. In addition, we and our contract manufacturers must comply with cGMPs that are strictly enforced by the FDA and other regulatory authorities through facilities inspection programs. These cGMPs include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. We or our contract manufacturers may be unable to comply with cGMPs or with other FDA, state, local and foreign regulatory requirements. Although we have obligations to review their compliance, we have limited control over our current, and expect to have limited control for any future, contract manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards, or with their quality control and quality assurance procedures. Large-scale manufacturing processes that have been developed, or which would be developed in the future, for our product candidates, or establishing additional manufacturers for Omidria, will require validation studies, which the FDA or other regulatory authorities must review and approve. Failure to comply with these requirements by our contract manufacturers could result in the initiation of enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, as well as the imposition of sanctions, including fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in regulatory approval, product seizure or recall or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of Omidria or any product candidate supplied by contract manufacturers is compromised due to their failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize Omidria or one or more of our product candidates, which would harm our business and prospects significantly.\nIf one or more of our contract manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with its contractual obligations, our ability to provide Omidria or product candidates to patients in our clinical trials or on a commercial scale would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial materials could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining our clinical trial programs and, depending on the period of delay, require us to commence new trials at significant additional expense or terminate the trials completely.\nIngredients, excipients and other materials necessary to manufacture Omidria or our product candidates may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which may adversely affect the development and commercialization of Omidria or those product candidates.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers must obtain from third-party suppliers the active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients and primary and secondary packaging materials necessary for our contract manufacturers to produce Omidria and our PharmacoSurgery product candidates for our clinical trials and, to the extent approved, for commercial distribution. Although we have or intend to enter into agreements with third-party suppliers that will guarantee the availability and timely delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients and materials for Omidria and our PharmacoSurgery product candidates, we have not yet entered into agreements for the supply of all such ingredients, excipients or materials and we may be unable to secure all such supply agreements or guarantees. Even if we were able to secure such agreements or guarantees, our suppliers may be unable or choose not to provide us the ingredients, excipients or materials in a timely manner or in the quantities required. If we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to obtain the quantities of these ingredients, excipients or materials that are necessary for the manufacture of commercial supplies of Omidria, our ability to generate revenue from the sale of Omidria would be materially and adversely affected. Further, if we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to obtain\nactive pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients and materials as necessary for our clinical trials or for the manufacture of commercial supplies of our product candidates, if approved, potential regulatory approval or commercialization would be delayed, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our product candidates.\nIf our clinical trials are delayed, we may be unable to develop our product candidates on a timely basis, which will increase our development costs and delay the potential commercialization of our product candidates should they receive regulatory approval.\nWe cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause regulatory agencies, Institutional Review Boards or Ethics Committees, or us to delay our clinical trials or suspend or delay the analysis of the data from those trials. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndiscussions with the FDA, the EMA or other foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or the inability to obtain required approvals from Institutional Review Boards, Ethics Committees or other responsible entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in enrolling patients into clinical trials;\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated retention rates of patients in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe need to repeat or conduct additional clinical trials as a result of problems such as inconclusive or negative results, failure to replicate positive early clinical data in subsequent clinical trials, poorly executed testing, a failure of a clinical site to adhere to the clinical protocol or an unacceptable study design;\n\u2022\nadverse findings in clinical or nonclinical studies related to the safety of our product candidates in humans;\n\u2022\nan insufficient supply of product candidate materials or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe need to qualify new suppliers of product candidate materials for FDA and foreign regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nan unfavorable FDA inspection or review of a clinical trial site or records of any clinical investigation;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of unacceptable drug-related side effects or adverse events experienced by participants in our clinical trials; or\n\u2022\nthe placement by a regulatory agency of a trial on a clinical hold.\nIn addition, a clinical trial or development program may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or Institutional Review Boards or Ethics Committees due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022\ninspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u2022\nthe failure to remove a clinical hold in a timely manner (which we cannot predict with certainty) or at all;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues or any determination that a trial presents unacceptable health risks; or\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial or development program, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to Institutional Review Boards or Ethics Committees for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial.\nIf the results of our clinical trials are not available when we expect or if we encounter any delay in the analysis of data from our clinical trials, we may be unable to file for regulatory approval or conduct additional clinical trials on the schedule we currently anticipate. Any delays in completing our clinical trials may increase our development costs, would slow down our product development and regulatory submission process, could delay our receipt of product revenue and could make it difficult to raise additional capital. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. In addition, significant clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our future products and may harm our business.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, those clinical trials could take longer than expected to complete and our receipt of regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may be unable to initiate or continue clinical trials for Omidria or our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities outside the U.S.\nPatient enrollment for any of our clinical trials also may be affected by other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe design of the trial protocol;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population;\n\u2022\nthe availability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility criteria of the study in question;\n\u2022\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the product or product candidate under study;\n\u2022\nthe efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately before and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials could result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays may result in increased development costs for our products or product candidates, and we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient cash to fund such increased cost when needed, which could result in further delay or termination of the trial.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct portions of our preclinical research and clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform as contractually required or otherwise expected, or if we fail to adequately supervise or monitor these parties, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties, such as CROs and research institutions, to conduct a portion of our preclinical research. We also rely on third parties, such as medical institutions, clinical investigators and CROs, to assist us in conducting our clinical trials. Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that our preclinical research and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with applicable regulations, the relevant trial protocol and within the context of approvals by an Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee, and we may not always be successful in ensuring such compliance. Our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of responsibility for ensuring compliance with FDA and other regulations and standards for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of preclinical research and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical and clinical development processes may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to commercialize or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nWe may need licenses for active ingredients from third parties to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates, which could increase our development costs and delay our ability to commercialize those product candidates.\nShould we decide to use active pharmaceutical ingredients in any of our product candidates that are proprietary to one or more third parties, we would need to obtain licenses to those active ingredients from those third parties. If we are unable to access rights to these active ingredients prior to conducting preclinical toxicology studies intended to support clinical trials, we may need to develop alternate product candidates from these programs by either accessing or developing alternate active ingredients, resulting in increased development costs and delays in commercialization of these product candidates. If we are unable to access rights to the desired active ingredients on commercially reasonable terms or develop suitable alternate active ingredients, we may not be able to commercialize product candidates from these programs.\nOur ability to pursue the development and commercialization of products from our MASP-2 program depends on the continuation of licenses from third parties.\nOur MASP-2 program is based in part on intellectual property rights that we licensed on a worldwide exclusive basis from the University of Leicester, the UK Medical Research Council at Oxford University and Helion. The continued maintenance of these agreements requires us to undertake development activities and, if regulatory approval for marketing is obtained, to pay royalties to each of these organizations upon commercialization of a MASP-2 product, such as OMS721. In addition, we are obligated to make remaining development and sales milestone payments to Helion of up to $6.1 million upon the achievement of certain events related to a MASP-2 product, such as the filing of an IND for OMS721 with the FDA, initiation of clinical trials, receipt of marketing approval and reaching specified sales milestones. Our ability to continue development and commercialization of products from our MASP-2 program, including OMS721, depends on our maintaining these exclusive licenses, which cannot be assured.\nOur ability to pursue the development and commercialization of product candidates from our MASP-2, MASP-3 and Plasmin programs depends on third-party developers and manufacturers of biologic drug products.\nAny product candidate from our MASP-2, MASP-3 or Plasmin programs would be a biologic drug product and we do not have the internal capability to hybridize, clone or manufacture biologics for clinical or commercial use. There are only a limited number of manufacturers of biologic drug products and we cannot be certain that we can enter into supply agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain clinical supplies of drug product for one of these programs, clinical trials or the development of any such product candidate for that program could be substantially delayed until we can find and qualify a manufacturer, which may increase our development costs, slow down our product development and approval process, delay receipt of product revenue and make it difficult to raise additional capital.\nOur preclinical programs may not produce product candidates that are suitable for clinical trials or that can be successfully commercialized or generate revenue through partnerships.\nAny product candidates from our preclinical programs must successfully complete preclinical testing, which may include demonstrating efficacy and the lack of toxicity in established animal models, before entering clinical trials. Many pharmaceutical and biological products do not successfully complete preclinical testing and, even if preclinical testing is successfully completed, may fail in clinical trials. In addition, there can be no assurance that positive results from preclinical studies will be predictive of results obtained from subsequent preclinical studies or clinical trials. For example, our studies of PDE7 inhibitors in different animal models of Parkinson\u2019s disease, which may or may not be relevant to the mechanism of action of PDE7 inhibitors in humans, have produced varying results. Further, we cannot be certain that any of our preclinical product development programs will generate product candidates that are suitable for clinical testing. For example, we have not yet generated any products or product candidates from our GPCR program. We may discover that there are fewer druggable targets among the orphan GPCRs than we currently estimate and that, for those orphan GPCRs for which we identify functionally active compounds that we elect to develop independently, we are unable to develop related product candidates that successfully complete preclinical or clinical testing. If we are unable to develop product candidates, potential corporate partners may be unwilling to enter into partnership agreements with us. We also cannot be certain that any product candidates that do advance into clinical trials will successfully demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials. Even if we achieve positive results in early clinical trials, they may not be predictive of the results in later trials.\nBecause we have a number of product candidates and development programs, we may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications for which there is a greater likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval and that may be more profitable, if approved.\nBecause we have limited resources, we must focus on the product candidates and clinical and preclinical development programs that we believe are the most promising. As a result, we may forego or delay the pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential and may not be able to progress development programs as rapidly as otherwise possible. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable potential commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Further, if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product through collaboration, license or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for the use, formulation and structure of our products and product candidates, the methods used to manufacture them, the related therapeutic targets and associated methods of treatment as well as on successfully defending these patents against potential third party challenges. Our ability to protect our products and product candidates from unauthorized making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing by third parties is dependent on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Case law and policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has continued to evolve in the U.S., and tests used for determining the patentability of patent claims in all technologies are in flux. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences patent situation outside the U.S. is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Further, the determination that a patent application or patent claim meets all of the requirements for patentability is a subjective determination based on the application of law and jurisprudence. For example, in the U.S., a determination of patentability by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or validity by a court or other trier of fact requires a determination that the claimed invention has utility and is both novel and non-obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of prior known publications and public information, and that the patent specification supporting the claim adequately describes the claimed invention, discloses the best mode known to the inventors for practicing the invention, and discloses the invention in a manner that enables one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention. These standards may be challenging to meet for patents directed to some of our technologies, including our target-based technologies. The ultimate determination by the USPTO or by a court or other trier of fact in the U.S., or corresponding foreign national patent offices or courts, on whether a claim meets all requirements of patentability cannot be assured. Although we have conducted searches for third-party publications, patents and other information that may impact the patentability of claims in our various patent applications and patents, we cannot be certain that all relevant information has been identified. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or patent applications, our licensed patents or patent applications or in third-party patents.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will be found to be patentable, including over our own prior art patents, or will issue as patents, nor can we make assurances as to the scope of any claims that may issue from these pending and future patent applications or to the outcome of any proceedings by any potential third parties that could challenge the patentability, validity or enforceability of our patents and patent applications in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could limit patent protection for our products and product candidates and materially harm our business.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by any of our pending U.S. patent applications filed or having priority dates prior to the U.S. having adopted a first-to-file standard on March 16, 2013, or any U.S. patents issued based on such patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to file patent applications on inventions that are the subject of pending foreign patent applications or that are the subject of pending U.S. patent applications filed or having priority dates after March 16, 2013, or any patents issued based on such foreign or U.S. patent applications;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products or duplicate any of our technologies or products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to generate sufficient data to support fully patent applications that protect the entire breadth of developments expected to result from our development programs, including the GPCR program;\n\u2022\nit is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or, if issued, that these patents will be sufficient to protect our technology or provide us with a basis for commercially viable products or provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u2022\nif our pending applications issue as patents, they may be challenged by third parties as not infringed, invalid or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws;\n\u2022\nif issued, the patents under which we hold rights may not be valid or enforceable; or\n\u2022\nwe may develop additional proprietary technologies or products or product candidates that are not patentable and which are unlikely to be adequately protected through trade secrets if, for example, a competitor were to develop independently duplicative, similar or alternative technologies or products.\nIn addition, to the extent we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for one of our products or product candidates or in the event such patent protection expires, it may no longer be cost-effective to extend our portfolio by pursuing additional development of a product or product candidate for follow-on indications.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technologies or products, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisers may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third-party entity illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nIf we choose to go to court to stop someone else from using our inventions, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that the underlying patents are invalid or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party\u2019s activities do not infringe the patents. It may not be feasible to detect and undertake patent enforcement action to stop infringing activity by a number of individual entities, each on a small scale, such as compounding pharmacies.\nFurther, a third party may claim that we or our contract manufacturers are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in the alleged infringing activity, including making, using or selling our products and product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we, or our contract manufacturers, are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, if we or our contract manufacturers are found to have violated a third party\u2019s patent, we or our contract manufacturers could be ordered to pay damages to the other party. We have agreed to or may agree to indemnify our contract manufacturers against certain patent infringement claims and thus may be responsible for any of their costs associated with such claims and actions. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we were sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products and product candidates or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nAlthough we have conducted searches of third-party patents with respect to our programs, we have not obtained written freedom to operate opinions for our programs and may not have identified all relevant third-party patents. Consequently, we cannot assure you that third-party patents containing claims covering our products, product candidates, programs, technologies or methods do not exist, have not been filed, or could not be filed or issued.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the capital necessary to continue our operations.\nThe terms of our debt facility place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility and, if we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business.\nWe have borrowed $32.0 million pursuant to the terms of the loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, and MidCap Financial SBIC, LP, or MidCap, entered into in March 2014. As collateral for this loan, we pledged substantially all of our assets other than intellectual property. The Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, pledge our intellectual property and engage in significant business transactions such as a change of control of Omeros, so long as we owe any amounts to the lenders under the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement. Any of these restrictions could significantly limit our operating and financial flexibility and ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities. In addition, if we default under the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement, the lenders may have the right to accelerate all of our repayment obligations under the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement and to take control of our pledged assets, which include our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, potentially requiring us to renegotiate the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement on terms less favorable to us. Further, if we are liquidated, the lenders\u2019 right to repayment\nwould be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation. An event of default under the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement includes the occurrence of any material adverse effect upon our business operations, properties, assets, results of operations or financial condition, taken as a whole with respect to our viability, that would reasonably be expected to result in our inability to repay the loan. If either lender declares all obligations under the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event that the lender interprets as constituting an event of default as defined under the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement, including but not limited to the lender concluding that a material adverse change has occurred as defined under the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement, we will be required to repay the loan immediately or to attempt to reverse the declaration through negotiation or litigation. Any declaration of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause our stock price to decline. If we raise any additional debt financing, the terms of such debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur agreements with Vulcan and the Life Sciences Discovery Fund Authority, a granting agency of the State of Washington, or LSDF, include terms that may reduce the purchase price that a third party would be willing to pay for the GPCR program or for us in a change of control.\nUnder our GPCR funding agreement with Vulcan, if we decide to sell or assign all or substantially all of the assets in our GPCR program prior to the time that Vulcan has received $60.0 million from us under our agreement, Vulcan may require that the purchaser assume all of our rights and obligations pursuant to the agreement, including our obligation to pay tiered percentages of any net proceeds that we receive from the GPCR program. The term of the Vulcan agreement is at least 35 years. If, at our option, we elect to assign the LSDF agreement in connection with the sale of the GPCR program, a potential purchaser would also have to assume similar payment obligations to LSDF. Potential purchasers of our GPCR program may be less inclined to purchase the program because of these obligations. Further, even if they are willing to assume our rights and obligations, they may be unwilling to pay as much for our GPCR program as they would be without such requirement. In addition, if a transaction results in a change of control of Omeros, the acquiring party will be required to assume our rights and obligations under the Vulcan and LSDF agreements. As a result of these provisions, a party that wants to acquire us through a change of control may be less inclined to do so or not be willing to pay as much.\nWe have granted Vulcan a lien on all of our GPCR assets, excluding intellectual property, which provides Vulcan a right, senior to our shareholders, to receive proceeds generated from a liquidation of our GPCR assets as well as potentially limiting our operating and financial flexibility.\nWe have granted Vulcan a lien on all of our GPCR assets, excluding intellectual property, to secure our obligations under our agreement with Vulcan. This lien is, and will continue to be, junior to security interests we grant to third parties in connection with indebtedness for borrowed money. The lien will automatically be released once we have paid Vulcan or its affiliate $25.0 million out of net proceeds received from the GPCR program. If we default under our agreement with Vulcan, in certain circumstances Vulcan may, subject to the rights of any holders of senior security interests, take control of such pledged assets. We have also agreed with Vulcan not to grant any liens on our GPCR-related intellectual property related to our cellular redistribution assay, subject to specified exceptions. If we are liquidated, Vulcan\u2019s right to receive any payments then due under our agreement would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation of our GPCR program assets. Further, the junior lien and negative pledge on our intellectual property restrict our operating and financial flexibility, potentially limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities and making it more difficult for us to respond to changes in our business.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business and must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive.\nOur research operations produce hazardous waste products, which include chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of these materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with applicable legal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of such substances and store our low-level radioactive waste at our facility until the materials are no longer considered radioactive. We may be required to incur further costs to comply with current or future environmental and safety regulations. In addition, although we carry insurance, in the event of accidental contamination or injury from these materials, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our insurance coverage and other resources.\nThe loss of members of our management team could substantially disrupt our business operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The members of our management team are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies other than on the life of Gregory A. Demopulos, M.D., our president, chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors. Losing the services of any key member of our management team, whether from death or disability, retirement, competing offers or other causes, could delay the execution of our business strategy, cause us to lose a strategic partner, or otherwise materially affect our operations.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, we may not be able to maintain our operations or grow effectively.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. If we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of qualified employees for any reason, we may not be able to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively. We have in the past maintained a rigorous, highly selective and time-consuming hiring process. We believe that our approach to hiring has significantly contributed to our success to date. If we do not succeed in attracting qualified personnel and retaining and motivating existing personnel, our existing operations may suffer and we may be unable to grow effectively.\nWe may encounter difficulties managing our growth, which could delay our business plans or adversely affect our results of operations.\nTo manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources, we may not be able to manage effectively the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations. Additionally, our inability to manage growth effectively could cause our operating costs to grow even faster than we currently are anticipating.\nWe incur significant costs and demands on management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs associated with compliance with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements, including under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market. The requirements of applicable SEC rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. We also expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage than was previously available. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.\nWe are required to make an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Further, our independent registered public accounting firm has been engaged to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404, management may not be able to assess whether our internal control over financial reporting is effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could result in a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, if we fail to maintain effective controls and procedures, we may be unable to provide the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner or otherwise comply with the standards applicable to us as a public company. Any failure by us to provide the required financial information in a timely manner could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and the market value of our securities.\nCyber-attacks or other failures in telecommunications or IT systems could result in information theft, data corruption and significant disruption of our business operations.\nWe utilize information technology, or IT, systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information in connection with our business activities. As use of digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, have increased in frequency and\nsophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, the confidentiality and the availability and integrity of our data. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing cyber-attacks or successfully mitigating their effect. Similarly, there can be no assurance that our collaborators, CROs and other contractors and consultants will be successful in protecting our clinical and other data that is stored on their systems. Any cyber-attack or destruction or loss of data could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. In addition, we may suffer reputational harm or face litigation or adverse regulatory action as a result of cyber-attacks or other data security breaches, and may incur significant additional expense to implement further data protection measures.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur competitors may develop products that are less expensive, safer or more effective, or which may otherwise diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any products that we may commercialize.\nWe may not achieve commercial success, particularly if our competitors market products that are safer, more effective, less expensive or faster to reach the market than Omidria or any future products that we may develop and commercialize. Our competitors also may market a product that proves to be unsafe or ineffective, which may affect the market for our competing product, or future product, regardless of the safety or efficacy of our product. For example, other pharmaceutical companies, many with significantly greater resources than we have, are developing PDE10 inhibitors similar to our product candidate OMS824, and these companies may be further along in development and have the resources to develop their product candidates at a faster rate than we can. For example, in 2012, Pfizer Inc. announced that its PDE10 inhibitor product candidate failed to demonstrate efficacy in a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the compound in acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. This and other potential clinical trial failures of PDE10 inhibitor product candidates may negatively reflect on the ability of OMS824 to demonstrate safety and efficacy. In addition, we believe that other companies are attempting to find compounds that functionally interact with orphan GPCRs. If any of these companies are able to achieve this for a given orphan GPCR before we do, we may be unable to establish a commercially valuable intellectual property position around that orphan GPCR. The failure of Omidria or any other future product that we may market to effectively compete with products marketed by our competitors would impair our ability to generate revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and many of our competitors have significantly more resources and experience, which may limit our commercial opportunities.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive in the markets in which we expect to compete. We expect to compete for market share against large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, new companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Our competitors may:\n\u2022\noperate larger research and development programs, possess commercial-scale manufacturing operations or have substantially greater financial resources than we do;\n\u2022\ninitiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can;\n\u2022\nhave greater success in recruiting skilled technical and scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent;\n\u2022\nmore effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic relationships; and\n\u2022\ntake advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.\nIn addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to remain current with rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of new or different approaches, potentially eliminating the advantages in our product discovery process that we believe we derive from our research approach and proprietary technologies and programs.\nOur products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products if and when any of them are approved.\nOmidria and any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval in the future, together with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, and advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or the approval may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor\nthe safety or efficacy of the product. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with Omidria or any of our other approved products, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory recalls;\n\u2022\nfines;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIf we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we may lose marketing approval for Omidria, or for our product candidates when and if any of them are approved.\nProduct liability claims may damage our reputation and, if insurance proves inadequate, these claims may harm our business.\nWe may be exposed to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the biopharmaceutical industry. A product liability claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about our product\u2019s safety and efficacy and could limit our ability to sell one or more products by preventing or interfering with commercialization of our products and product candidates. In addition, product liability insurance for the biopharmaceutical industry is generally expensive to the extent it is available at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that we will be able to secure increased coverage if the commercialization of Omidria or our product candidates progresses, or that future claims against us will be covered by our product liability insurance. Further, our product liability insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may be insufficient to reimburse us for any or all expenses or losses we may suffer. A successful claim against us with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, our stock traded as high as $25.10 per share and as low as $9.76 per share. The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors could include:\n\u2022\nfailure of Omidria or any of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\nEMA actions related to our MAA submission for Omidria;\n\u2022\nFDA or foreign regulatory actions related to Omidria or any of our product candidates, including the suspension by the FDA of our OMS824 Phase 2 clinical trial in Huntington\u2019s disease;\n\u2022\nresults from our clinical development programs, including the data from our ongoing clinical development programs evaluating Omidria, OMS103, OMS824, OMS721 and PPAR\u03b3;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the progress of our preclinical programs, including without limitation our GPCR program;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, regulatory approvals, clinical milestones, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nthird-party coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, our involvement in and resolution of litigation;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet our repayment and other obligations under the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate commercial supplies of Omidria and our product candidates;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board or management;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we raise funds by issuing equity or debt securities;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\u2022\npolitical instability, natural disasters, war and/or events of terrorism.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various commercial, scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals or milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. Also, from time to time, we expect that we will publicly announce the anticipated timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, our stock price may decline and the commercialization of Omidria and our product candidates may be delayed.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of publicly traded companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe expect that we will continue to need additional capital in the future; however, such capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, when or as we require additional funding. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that may be convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock, our existing shareholders would experience further dilution.\nAlthough we expect that we will need additional capital in the future, we cannot be certain that it will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, when required. Disruptions in the global equity and credit markets may limit our ability to access capital. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders would experience dilution, which may be significant and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Any debt financing, if available, may restrict our operations similar to the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement, or in other ways. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the commercialization of Omidria or the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or one or more of our other research and development initiatives. We also could be required to seek collaborators for one or more of our current or future products at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than otherwise might be available or to relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or products that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. We also may have insufficient funds or otherwise be unable to advance our preclinical programs, such as potential new drug targets developed from our GPCR program, to a point where they can generate revenue through partnerships, collaborations or other arrangements. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales of shares by holders of outstanding warrants and options could cause our stock price to decline.\nApproximately 11.4 million shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding warrants or subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Washington law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, difficult and prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and under Washington law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on shareholder actions by less than unanimous written consent, restrictions on the ability of shareholders to fill board vacancies and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Washington, we are governed by the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, which, among other things, restricts the ability of shareholders owning 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer may be considered\nbeneficial by some shareholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur business requires significant funding, and we have not generated any material revenue. We currently plan to invest all available funds and future earnings, if any, in the development and growth of our business. Additionally, under the Oxford/MidCap Loan Agreement, we have agreed not to pay any dividends so long as we have any outstanding obligations under the agreement. Therefore, we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, a rise in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable, will be the sole source of potential gain for shareholders in the foreseeable future, and an investment in our common stock for dividend income should not be relied upon.", "PERMNO": 93085, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "OMER"}
