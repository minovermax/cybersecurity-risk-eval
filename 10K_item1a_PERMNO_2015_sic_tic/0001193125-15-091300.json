RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing herein, with respect to any investment in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our operations and results.\nRisks related to our business and industry\nHETLIOZ\u00ae may not be commercially successful.\nMarket acceptance of and demand for HETLIOZ\u00ae will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ncost of treatment;\n\u2022\npricing and availability of alternative products;\n\u2022\nthe cost and success of our Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) awareness campaign;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain third-party coverage or reimbursement for HETLIOZ\u00ae;\n\u2022\nperceived efficacy relative to other available therapies;\n\u2022\nshifts in the medical community to new treatment paradigms or standards of care;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration; and\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects associated with treatment.\nBecause we initiated the U.S. commercialization of HETLIOZ\u00ae in 2014, we have limited information with regard to the market acceptance of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the U.S. or elsewhere. As a result, we may have to revise our estimates regarding the market acceptance of HETLIOZ\u00ae or our strategy to commercialize the product.\nIn addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and to utilize a substantial portion of our cash resources as we continue the commercialization of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the U.S., continue our Non-24 awareness campaign and continue to grow our operational capabilities. This represents a significant investment in the commercial success of HETLIOZ\u00ae, which is uncertain.\nWe are heavily dependent on the commercial success of HETLIOZ\u00ae, which received marketing authorization and was commercially launched in the U.S. in 2014, and on the regulatory approval of HETLIOZ\u00ae for the treatment of Non-24 in other countries, which may never occur.\nOur future success is currently substantially dependent upon the commercial success of HETLIOZ\u00ae for the treatment of Non-24 in the U.S. In January 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved our New Drug Application (NDA) for HETLIOZ\u00ae for the treatment of Non-24 and in April 2014, we commenced the U.S. commercial launch of HETLIOZ\u00ae. Our future success is also dependent upon successfully obtaining regulatory approval from foreign regulatory bodies to market HETLIOZ\u00ae for the treatment of Non-24 in other jurisdictions, and if approved, successfully commercializing HETLIOZ\u00ae in such jurisdictions. In June 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for evaluation our Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for oral HETLIOZ\u00ae capsules for the treatment of Non-24.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we seek the approval of HETLIOZ\u00ae in other jurisdictions. This represents a significant investment in the regulatory success of HETLIOZ\u00ae, which is uncertain. We may not receive regulatory approval in other jurisdictions for HETLIOZ\u00ae; and if we do receive regulatory approval in such other jurisdictions for HETLIOZ\u00ae, we may not be able to commercialize HETLIOZ\u00ae successfully, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we do not successfully commercialize HETLIOZ\u00ae in other countries in which HETLIOZ\u00ae may be approved for sale, our ability to generate increased product sales revenue may be jeopardized and, consequently, our business may be seriously harmed.\nWe recently acquired further rights to Fanapt\u00ae in the United States, and began selling, marketing and distributing Fanapt\u00ae in the United States in the first quarter of 2015, and our ability to generate meaningful product sales from Fanapt\u00ae will depend on the success of this product in the marketplace.\nOur ability to generate meaningful product sales from Fanapt\u00ae will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nDisruptions in the commercialization of Fanapt\u00ae in the U.S. caused by the transfer of Fanapt\u00ae from Novartis to Vanda;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts in support of Fanapt\u00ae;\n\u2022\nthe ability of patients to be able to afford Fanapt\u00ae or obtain health care coverage that covers Fanapt\u00ae;\n\u2022\nacceptance of, and ongoing satisfaction, with Fanapt\u00ae by the medical community, patients receiving therapy and third party payors;\n\u2022\na satisfactory efficacy and safety profile as demonstrated in a broad patient population;\n\u2022\nthe size of the market for Fanapt\u00ae;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our manufacturing partners to successfully expand and sustain capacity to meet demand;\n\u2022\ncost and availability of raw materials;\n\u2022\nsafety concerns in the marketplace for schizophrenia therapies;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments relating to the manufacture or continued use of Fanapt\u00ae;\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the timing of product launches, pricing and discounts;\n\u2022\nthe competitive landscape for approved and developing therapies that will compete with Fanapt\u00ae;\n\u2022\nour or our partners\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory approval for Fanapt\u00ae in additional countries; and\n\u2022\nthe unfavorable outcome or other negative effects of any potential litigation relating to Fanapt\u00ae.\nFor reasons outside of our control, including those mentioned above, sales of Fanapt\u00ae may not meet our or financial or industry analysts\u2019 expectations. Any significant negative developments relating to Fanapt\u00ae, such as safety or efficacy issues, the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products or adverse regulatory or legislative developments, will have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a company, we have minimal experience selling, marketing or distributing products, which may make commercializing our products difficult.\nAt present, we as a company have minimal marketing experience. Therefore, in order for us to successfully commercialize HETLIOZ\u00ae, Fanapt\u00ae or our other products, we must either acquire or continue to internally develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or enter into collaborations with partners to perform these services for us. We may, in some instances, rely significantly on sales, marketing and distribution arrangements with our collaborative partners and other third parties.\nFor the commercialization of HETLIOZ\u00ae, Fanapt\u00ae or our other products, we may not be able to establish additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or partnerships on acceptable terms or at all. In regard to our current foreign partners and any additional distribution arrangements or other agreements we may enter into, our success will be materially dependent upon the performance of our partners. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products without partners or licensees include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by our sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to companies with broader product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs associated with growing our own sales and marketing team or with entering into a partnering agreement with an independent sales and marketing organization.\nThe cost of growing and maintaining a sales, marketing and distribution organization may exceed its cost effectiveness. If we fail to continue to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, if sales efforts are not effective or if costs of developing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities exceed their cost effectiveness, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may enter into third party collaborations from time to time in order to commercialize our products. If we are unable to identify or enter into an agreement with any material third-party collaborator, if our collaborations with any such third-party are not commercially successful or if our agreement with any such third-party is terminated or allowed to expire, we could be adversely affected financially or our business reputation could be harmed.\nOur business strategy includes entering into collaborations with corporate collaborators for the commercialization of HETLIOZ\u00ae, Fanapt\u00ae and our other products. Areas in which we may potentially enter into third-party collaboration arrangements include joint sales and marketing arrangements for sales and marketing in certain European Union countries and elsewhere outside of the U.S., and future product development arrangements. If we are unable to identify or enter into an agreement with any material third-party collaborator we could be adversely affected financially or our business reputation could be harmed. Any arrangements we do enter into may not be scientifically or commercially successful. The termination of any of these arrangements might adversely affect our ability to develop, commercialize and market our products.\nThe success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Our collaborators will have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. We expect that the risks which we face in connection with these future collaborations will include the following:\n\u2022\nour collaboration agreements are expected to be for fixed terms and subject to termination under various circumstances, including, in many cases, on short notice without cause;\n\u2022\nour collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, products and services that are similar to or competitive with our products which are the subject of their collaboration with us; and\n\u2022\nour collaborators may change the focus of their commercialization efforts. In recent years there have been a significant number of mergers and consolidations in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, some of which have resulted in the participant companies reevaluating and shifting the focus of their business following the completion of these transactions. The ability of our products to reach their potential could be limited if any of our future collaborators decreases or fails to increase spending relating to such products.\nCollaborations with pharmaceutical companies and other third-parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. With respect to our future collaborations, any such termination or expiration could adversely affect us financially as well as harm our business reputation.\nEven after we or our partners obtain regulatory approvals of a product, acceptance of the product in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve commercial acceptance will prevent or delay our ability to generate significant revenue from such product.\nEven after obtaining regulatory approvals for the sale of our products, the commercial success of these products will depend, among other things, on their acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and other members of the medical community as a therapeutic and cost-effective alternative to competing products and treatments. The degree of market acceptance of any product will depend on a number of factors, including the demonstration of its safety and efficacy, its cost-effectiveness, its potential advantages over other therapies, the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors with respect to such product, our ability to attract and maintain corporate partners, including pharmaceutical companies, to assist in commercializing our products, receipt of regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we or our partners are developing and the effectiveness of our and our partners\u2019 marketing and distribution capabilities. If our approved products fail to gain market acceptance, we may be unable to earn sufficient revenue to continue our business. If our approved products do not become widely accepted by physicians, patients, third-party payors and other members of the medical community, it is unlikely that we will ever become profitable on a sustained basis or achieve significant revenues.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on outsourcing arrangements for many of our activities, including clinical development and supply of HETLIOZ\u00ae, Fanapt\u00ae and our other products.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 64 full-time employees and, as a result, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on outsourcing arrangements for a significant portion of our activities, including distribution, clinical research, data collection and analysis, manufacturing, and human resources, as well as for certain functions as a public company. We may have limited control over these third parties and we cannot guarantee that they will perform their obligations in an effective and timely manner.\nDisruptions to our HETLIOZ\u00ae or Fanapt\u00ae supply chains could materially affect our ability to successfully commercialize HETLIOZ\u00ae or Fanapt\u00ae, thereby reducing our future earnings and prospects.\nA loss or disruption with any one of our manufacturers or suppliers could disrupt supply of HETLIOZ\u00ae or Fanapt\u00ae, possibly for a significant time period, and we may not have sufficient inventories to maintain supply before the manufacturer or supplier could be replaced or the disruption is resolved. In addition, marketed drugs and their contract manufacturing organizations are subject to continual review, including review and approval of their manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing processes, which can result in delays in the regulatory approval process and/or commercialization. Introducing a replacement or backup manufacturer or supplier for HETLIOZ\u00ae or Fanapt\u00ae requires a lengthy regulatory and commercial process and there can be no guarantee that we could obtain necessary regulatory approvals in a timely fashion or at all. In addition, it is difficult to identify and select qualified suppliers and manufacturers with the necessary technical capabilities, and establishing new supply and manufacturing sources involves a lengthy and technical engineering process.\nWe and our partners face heavy government regulation. We and our partners are also continually at risk of the FDA requiring us or them to discontinue marketing any products that have obtained, or in the future may obtain, regulatory approval.\nFollowing marketing approval of a product, we and our partners will continue to face heavy governmental regulation. The marketing, distribution and manufacture of approved products remain subject to extensive ongoing regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\nfines;\n\u2022\ncivil penalties;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of products;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022\nrefusal of the government to grant future approvals;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of approvals; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nIf we or our partners become subject to any of these foregoing items, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with government regulations regarding the sale and marketing of our products could harm our business.\nOur and our partners\u2019 activities, including the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, including regulation under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes. We are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to purchase or arrange for or recommend the purchase of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws may apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of drugs and biologicals, such as us, by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, with hospitals, physicians, and other potential purchasers of drugs and biologicals. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance that can be substantial, including the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).\nPharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Federal False Claim Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and other violations in connection with off-label promotion of products and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement or related to environmental matters and claims under state laws, including state anti-kickback and fraud laws.\nWhile we continually strive to comply with these complex requirements, interpretations of the applicability of these laws to marketing practices are ever evolving. If any such actions are instituted against us or our partners and we or they are not successful in defending such actions or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant and material adverse impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe intend to seek regulatory approvals for our products in foreign jurisdictions, but we may not obtain any such approvals.\nWe intend to market our products in foreign jurisdictions. In order to market our products in foreign jurisdictions, we or our partners may be required to obtain separate regulatory approvals and to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional trials, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Additionally, the foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. For all of these reasons, we or our partners may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We or our partners may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. The failure to obtain these approvals could harm our business materially.\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our research and development activities and commercialization efforts, we may be unable to continue operations or we may be forced to share our rights to commercialize our products with third parties on terms that may not be attractive to us.\nOur activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital throughout 2015 and beyond. It is uncertain whether our existing funds will be sufficient to meet our operating needs. As of December 31, 2014, our total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $129.8 million. Our long term capital requirements are expected to depend on many factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize HETLIOZ\u00ae and Fanapt\u00ae globally;\n\u2022\ncosts of developing and maintaining sales, marketing and distribution channels and our ability to sell our products;\n\u2022\ncosts involved in establishing manufacturing capabilities for commercial quantities of our products;\n\u2022\nthe amount of royalty and milestone payments, if any, received from our commercial partners;\n\u2022\nthe number of potential formulations and products in development;\n\u2022\nprogress with pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\ntime and costs involved in obtaining regulatory (including FDA) approval;\n\u2022\ncosts involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent, trademark and other intellectual property claims;\n\u2022\ncompeting technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\ncosts for recruiting and retaining employees and consultants;\n\u2022\ncosts for training physicians; and\n\u2022\nlegal, accounting, insurance and other professional and business related costs.\nAs a result, we may need to raise additional capital to fund our anticipated operating expenses and execute on our business plans. In our capital-raising efforts, we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities, obtain a bank credit facility, or enter into partnerships or other collaboration agreements. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to our stockholders and may also result in a lower price for our common stock. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that could restrict our operations. However, we may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our planned activities, we may not be able to continue operations, or we may have to enter into partnerships or other collaboration agreements that could require us to share commercial rights to our products to a greater extent or at earlier stages in the drug development process than is currently intended. These partnerships or collaborations, if consummated prior to proof-of-efficacy or safety of a given product, could impair our ability to realize value from that product. If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our operations and planned growth, develop or enhance our technologies or products, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive market pressures, any of which would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of specialty pharmacies for distribution of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the U.S., and the loss of one or more of these specialty pharmacies or their failure to distribute HETLIOZ\u00ae effectively would materially harm our business.\nHETLIOZ\u00ae is only available for distribution through a limited number of specialty pharmacies in the U.S. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic\nconditions, which often require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. The use of specialty pharmacies involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these specialty pharmacies will:\n\u2022\nnot provide us accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using HETLIOZ\u00ae or complaints about HETLIOZ\u00ae;\n\u2022\nreduce their efforts or discontinue to sell or support or otherwise not effectively sell or support HETLIOZ\u00ae;\n\u2022\nnot devote the resources necessary to sell HETLIOZ\u00ae in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n\u2022\nbe unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n\u2022\ncease operations.\nIn addition if one or more of our specialty pharmacies do not fulfill their contractual obligations to us, or refuse or fail to adequately serve patients, or their agreements are terminated without adequate notice, shipments of HETLIOZ\u00ae, and associated revenues, would be adversely affected. We expect that it would take a significant amount of time if we were required to replace one or more of our specialty pharmacies.\nOur revenues from Fanapt\u00ae are substantially dependent on sales through a limited number of wholesalers, and such revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nWe sell Fanapt\u00ae primarily through a limited number of pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. The use of pharmaceutical wholesalers involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these pharmaceutical wholesalers will:\n\u2022\nnot provide us accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, demand from wholesaler customers buying Fanapt\u00ae or complaints about Fanapt\u00ae;\n\u2022\nreduce their efforts or discontinue to sell or support or otherwise not effectively sell or support Fanapt\u00ae;\n\u2022\nnot devote the resources necessary to sell Fanapt\u00ae in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n\u2022\nbe unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n\u2022\ncease operations.\nAdditionally, our reliance on a small number of wholesalers could cause revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the buying patterns of these wholesalers. In addition, if any of these wholesalers fails to pay on a timely basis or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nOur future success will depend on our or our partners\u2019 ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to our products and our ability to identify and develop additional products. Large, fully integrated pharmaceutical companies, either alone or together with collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources and have significantly greater experience than we do in:\n\u2022\ndeveloping products;\n\u2022\nundertaking pre-clinical testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products; and\n\u2022\nmanufacturing, marketing and selling products.\nThese companies may invest heavily and quickly to discover and develop novel products that could make our products obsolete. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA\nor foreign regulatory approval or commercializing superior products or other competing products before we do. Technological developments or the FDA or foreign regulatory approval of new therapeutic indications for existing products may make our products obsolete or may make them more difficult to market successfully, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur products, if successfully developed and approved for commercial sale, will compete with a number of drugs and therapies currently manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies. Our products may also compete with new products currently under development by others or with products which may cost less than our products. Physicians, patients, third party payors and the medical community may not accept or utilize any of our products that may be approved. If HETLIOZ\u00ae, Fanapt\u00ae and our other products, if and when approved, do not achieve significant market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. We believe the primary competitors for HETLIOZ\u00ae and Fanapt\u00ae are as follows:\n\u2022\nFor HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of Non-24, there are no approved direct competitors. Insomnia treatments include, Rozerem\u00ae (ramelteon) by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Limited, hypnotics such as Ambien\u00ae (zolpidem) by Sanofi (including Ambien CR\u00ae), Lunesta\u00ae (eszopiclone) by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sonata\u00ae (zaleplon) by Pfizer Inc., Silenor\u00ae (doxepin) by Pernix Therapeutics, generic products such as zolpidem, trazodone and doxepin, and over-the-counter remedies such as Benadryl\u00ae and Tylenol PM\u00ae. The class of melatonin agonists includes Rozerem\u00ae (ramelteon) by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Limited, Valdoxan\u00ae (agemelatine) by Servier, Circadin\u00ae (long-acting melatonin) by Neurim Pharmaceuticals and the food supplement melatonin. Shift work and excessive sleepiness disorder treatments include Nuvigil\u00ae (armodafinil) and Provigil\u00ae (modafinil) both by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\n\u2022\nFor Fanapt\u00ae in the treatment of schizophrenia, the atypical antipsychotics competitors are Risperdal\u00ae (risperidone), including the depot formulation Risperdal\u00ae Consta\u00ae and Invega\u00ae (paliperidone), including the depot formulation Invega\u00ae Sustenna\u00ae, each by Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Zyprexa\u00ae (olanzapine), including the depot formulation Zyprexa\u00ae Relprevv\u2122, each by Eli Lilly and Company, Seroquel\u00ae (quetiapine) by AstraZeneca PLC, Abilify\u00ae (aripiprazole) by BMS/Otsuka America Pharmaceutical Inc., Abilify\u00ae Maintena\u00ae (the depot formulation of Abilify\u00ae) by Lundbeck/Otsuka America Pharmaceutical Inc., Geodon\u00ae (ziprasidone) by Pfizer Inc., Saphris\u00ae (asenapine) by Actavis plc, Latuda\u00ae (lurasidone) by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., and generic clozapine, as well as the typical antipsychotics haloperidol, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, and sulpiride (all of which are generic).\nAdditionally, we may face competition from newly developed generic products. Under the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, more commonly known as the \u201cHatch-Waxman Act,\u201d newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act seeks to stimulate competition by providing incentives to generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to introduce non-infringing forms of patented pharmaceutical products and to challenge patents on branded pharmaceutical products. If we are unsuccessful at challenging an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), filed pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act, cheaper generic versions of our products, which may be favored by insurers and third-party payors, may be launched commercially, which would harm our business.\nWe previously filed suit against Roxane Laboratories, Inc. (Roxane) seeking an adjudication that Roxane has infringed one or more claims of one of our patents relating to Fanapt\u00ae by submitting to the FDA an ANDA for generic versions of iloperidone oral tablets in 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, and 12 mg strengths. The relief requested by us in this suit includes a request for a permanent injunction preventing Roxane from infringing the asserted claims of the patent by engaging in the manufacture, use, offer to sell, sale, importation or distribution of generic versions of iloperidone before the expiration of the patent in 2027. The adjudication of this suit in favor of Roxane could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition.\nIn November 2013, Novartis brought a patent infringement action against Roxane. The suit alleges that Roxane\u2019s filing of an ANDA for generic iloperidone with a paragraph IV certification infringes Sanofi\u2019s new chemical entity patent. Roxane is defending on the grounds that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable or\nthat certain patent claims are not infringed. Roxane also filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the court lacks jurisdiction. At present, approval of Roxane\u2019s ANDA is stayed for 30 months from the end of the data exclusivity period for iloperidone, i.e., until November 6, 2016. Upon our acquisition of Novartis\u2019 rights in Fanapt\u00ae, we assumed responsibility for this litigation. In addition to the risk that Roxane will prevail on its defenses or on its motion to dismiss, the litigation may divert substantial financial and employee resources from our business. It is also possible that a counterclaim will expose us to financial liability. If Roxane prevails on its defenses or on its motion to dismiss, Roxane could be allowed to launch a generic iloperidone product prior to expiration of the 30 months stay.\nFDA regulatory approval of our products is uncertain.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing and marketing of products such as those that we have developed or that we or our partners are developing are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local government authorities, including the FDA. To obtain regulatory approval of such products, we or our partners must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory agency that, among other things, the product is safe and effective for its intended use. In addition, we or our partners must show that the manufacturing facilities used to produce such products are in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (cGMP).\nThe process of obtaining FDA and other required regulatory approvals and clearances can take many years and will require us and our partners, as applicable, to expend substantial time and capital. Despite the time and expense expended, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. The number of pre-clinical and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the product, the disease or condition that the product is in development for, and the requirements applicable to that particular product. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a product for many reasons, including that:\n\u2022\na product may not be shown to be safe or effective;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may interpret data from pre-clinical and clinical trials in different ways than we or our partners do;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not approve our or our partners\u2019 manufacturing processes or facilities;\n\u2022\na product may not be approved for all the indications we or our partners request;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not meet, or may extend, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA-V) date with respect to a particular NDA; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not agree with our or our partners\u2019 regulatory approval strategies or components of the regulatory filings, such as clinical trial designs.\nFor example, if certain of our or our partners\u2019 methods for analyzing trial data are not accepted by the FDA, we or our partners may fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products.\nAny delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals for our products will result in increased costs, could diminish competitive advantages that we may attain and would adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products. Other than HETLIOZ\u00ae in the U.S. and Fanapt\u00ae in the U.S., Mexico and Israel, we have not received regulatory approval to market any of our products in any jurisdiction.\nEven following regulatory approval of our products, the FDA may impose limitations on the indicated uses for which such products may be marketed, subsequently withdraw approval or take other actions against us, our partners or such products that are adverse to our business. The FDA generally approves drugs for particular indications. An approval for a more limited indication reduces the size of the potential market for the product. Product approvals, once granted, may be withdrawn or modified if problems occur after initial marketing.\nWe and our partners also are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the environment and the use and disposal of hazardous substances used in connection with discovery, research and development\nwork. In addition, we cannot predict the extent to which new governmental regulations might significantly impede the discovery, development, production and marketing of our products. We or our partners may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations, and we may be adversely affected by the cost of such compliance or the inability to comply with such laws or regulations.\nIf our products are determined to be unsafe or ineffective in humans, whether commercially or in clinical trials, our business will be materially harmed.\nDespite the FDA\u2019s approval of the NDA for HETLIOZ\u00ae in January 2014 and the NDA for Fanapt\u00ae in May 2009, and the positive results of our completed trials for HETLIOZ\u00ae and Fanapt\u00ae, we are uncertain whether either of these products will ultimately prove to be effective and safe in humans. Frequently, products that have shown promising results in clinical trials have suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials or even after they are approved for commercial sale. Future uses of our products, whether in clinical trials or commercially, may reveal that the product is ineffective, unacceptably toxic, has other undesirable side effects, is difficult to manufacture on a large scale, is uneconomical, infringes on proprietary rights of another party or is otherwise not fit for further use. If our products are determined to be unsafe or ineffective in humans, our business will be materially harmed.\nClinical trials for our products are expensive and their outcomes are uncertain. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our products could severely harm our business.\nPre-clinical studies and clinical trials required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products are time-consuming and expensive and together take several years to complete. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our products, we or our partners must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that such product is safe and effective for use in humans. We have incurred, and we will continue to incur, substantial expense for, and devote a significant amount of time to, preclinical testing and clinical trials.\nHistorically, the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials often have not predicted results of later clinical trials. A number of new drugs have shown promising results in clinical trials, but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Clinical trials conducted by us, by our partners or by third parties on our or our partners\u2019 behalf may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our products. Regulatory authorities may not permit us or our partners to undertake any additional clinical trials for our products, may force us to stop any ongoing clinical trials and it may be difficult to design efficacy studies for our products in new indications.\nClinical development efforts performed by us or our partners may not be successfully completed. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more. The length of time can vary substantially with the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the products and the size of the prospective patient population. The commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to manufacture or obtain from third parties materials sufficient for use in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in beginning a clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data;\n\u2022\npoor effectiveness of our products during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues or side effects; and\n\u2022\ngovernmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements and guidelines.\nIf we or our partners fail to complete successfully one or more clinical trials for our products, we or they may not receive the regulatory approvals needed to market that product. Therefore, any failure or delay in commencing or completing these clinical trials would harm our business materially.\nOur products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay, prevent or result in the revocation of their regulatory approval or limit their marketability.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our products could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, and in turn prevent us or our partners from commercializing or continuing the commercialization of such products and generating revenues from their sale. We will continue to assess the side effect profile of our products in ongoing clinical development programs. However, we cannot predict whether the commercial use of our approved products (or our products in development, if and when they are approved for commercial use) will produce undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in the use of, or in clinical trials conducted for, such products to date. Additionally, incidents of product misuse may occur. These events, among others, could result in product recalls, product liability actions or withdrawals or additional regulatory controls, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, if after receiving marketing approval of a product, we, our partners or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such product, we or our partners could face one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022\nwe or our partners may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product; and\n\u2022\nour, our partner\u2019s or the product\u2019s reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale.\nWe have a history of operating losses, anticipate future losses and may never become profitable on a sustained basis.\nWe have been engaged in identifying and developing products since March 2003, which has required, and will continue to require, significant research and development expenditures. The commercialization of HETLIOZ\u00ae and Fanapt\u00ae will require substantial additional expenditures.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $288.0 million and we cannot estimate with precision the extent of our future losses. In April 2014, we commercially launched HETLIOZ\u00ae in the U.S. for the treatment of Non-24. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we acquired all further rights to Fanapt\u00ae from Novartis. The continued commercialization of HETLIOZ\u00ae and generating U.S. sales of Fanapt\u00ae on our own will require substantial additional expenditures. In addition, we may not succeed in commercializing HETLIOZ\u00ae, Fanapt\u00ae or any other products. Novartis launched Fanapt\u00ae in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2010 and we began selling Fanapt\u00ae on our own in the first quarter of 2015. We may not succeed in gaining additional market acceptance of Fanapt\u00ae in the U.S. and we may not succeed in commercializing HETLIOZ\u00ae or Fanapt\u00ae outside of the U.S. We may not be profitable even if our products are successfully commercialized. We may be unable to fully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, commercialize, manufacture, market, sell and derive revenue from our products in the timeframes we project, if at all, and our inability to do so would materially and adversely impact the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will achieve sustained profitability. Our ability to achieve sustained profitability in the future depends, in part, upon:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products, particularly HETLIOZ\u00ae for the treatment of Non-24, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize HETLIOZ\u00ae in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which HETLIOZ\u00ae may receive regulatory approval, if any;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully raise awareness regarding Non-24 in the medical and patient communities;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully market and sell Fanapt\u00ae in the U.S. and our or our partners\u2019 ability to successfully market and sell Fanapt\u00ae in other jurisdictions in which we may receive regulatory approval, if any;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into and maintain agreements to develop and commercialize our products;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to develop, have manufactured and market our products;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to obtain adequate reimbursement coverage for our products from insurance companies, government programs and other third party payors; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional research and development funding from collaborative partners or funding for our products.\nIn addition, the amount we spend will impact our profitability. Our spending will depend, in part, upon:\n\u2022\nthe costs of our marketing or awareness campaigns;\n\u2022\nthe progress of our research and development programs for our products, including clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense that will be required to pursue FDA and/or foreign regulatory approvals for our products and whether such approvals are obtained on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense required to prosecute, enforce and/or challenge patent and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost of operating and maintaining development and research facilities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of third party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nthe number of additional products we pursue;\n\u2022\nhow competing technological and market developments affect our products;\n\u2022\nthe cost of possible acquisitions of technologies, products, product rights or companies;\n\u2022\nthe cost of obtaining licenses to use technology owned by others for proprietary products and otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe costs and effects of potential litigation; and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with recruiting and compensating a highly skilled workforce in an environment where competition for such employees may be intense.\nWe may not achieve all or any of these goals and, thus, we cannot provide assurances that we will ever be profitable on a sustained basis or achieve significant revenues. Even if we do achieve some or all of these goals, we may not achieve significant or sustained commercial success.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be limited as a result of transactions involving our common stock.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (NOLs) and certain other tax assets (tax attributes) to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). Transactions involving our common stock, even those outside our control, such as purchases or sales by investors, within the testing period could result in an ownership change. A limitation on our ability to utilize some or all of our NOLs or credits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Ownership changes did occur as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2008. However, our management believes that we had sufficient \u201cBuilt-In-Gain\u201d to offset the Section 382 of the Code limitation generated by the ownership changes. Any future ownership changes may cause our existing tax attributes to have additional limitations.\nIf our contract research organizations do not successfully carry out their duties or if we lose our relationships with contract research organizations, our drug development efforts could be delayed.\nOur arrangements with contract research organizations are critical to our success in bringing our products to the market and promoting such marketed products profitably. We are dependent on contract research organizations, third-party vendors and investigators for pre-clinical testing and clinical trials related to our drug discovery and development efforts and we will likely continue to depend on them to assist in our future discovery and development efforts. These parties are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. As such, they may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The parties with which we contract for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of the trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. If they fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs or if their performance is substandard, it will delay the development, approval and commercialization of our products. Moreover, these parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If they assist our competitors, it could harm our competitive position.\nOur contract research organizations could merge with or be acquired by other companies or experience financial or other setbacks unrelated to our collaboration that could, nevertheless, materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we lose our relationship with any one or more of these parties, we could experience a significant delay in both identifying another comparable provider and then contracting for its services. We may be unable to retain an alternative provider on reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we locate an alternative provider, it is likely that this provider may need additional time to respond to our needs and may not provide the same type or level of service as the original provider. In addition, any provider that we retain will be subject to current Good Laboratory Practices (cGLP), and similar foreign standards and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by these providers. Consequently, if these practices and standards are not adhered to by these providers, the development and commercialization of our products could be delayed.\nWe rely on a limited number of third party manufacturers to formulate and manufacture our products and our business will be seriously harmed if these manufacturers are not able to satisfy our demand and alternative sources are not available.\nOur expertise is primarily in the research and development and pre-clinical and clinical trial phases of product development. We do not have an in-house manufacturing capability and depend completely on a small number of third-party manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient formulators for the manufacture of our products. Therefore, we are dependent on third parties for our formulation development and manufacturing of our products. This may expose us to the risk of not being able to directly oversee the production and quality of the manufacturing process and provide ample commercial supplies to successfully launch and maintain the marketing of our products. Furthermore, these third party contractors, whether foreign or domestic, may experience regulatory compliance difficulty, mechanical shut downs, employee strikes, or other unforeseeable events that may delay or limit production. Our inability to adequately establish, supervise and conduct (either ourselves or through third parties) all aspects of the formulation and manufacturing processes would have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and commercialize our products.\nIn January 2014, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Patheon) for the manufacture of commercial supplies of HETLIOZ\u00ae 20 mg capsules. In addition, we assumed Novartis\u2019 agreement with Patheon for the manufacture of Fanapt\u00ae in the fourth quarter of 2014. We do not have exclusive long-term agreements with any other third party manufacturers of our products. If Patheon, or any other third party manufacturer, is unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under our manufacturing agreements for any reason, we may not be able to locate alternative acceptable manufacturers or formulators or enter into favorable agreements with them. Any inability to acquire sufficient quantities of our products in a timely manner from these third parties could adversely affect sales of our products, delay clinical trials and prevent us from developing our products in a cost-effective manner or on a timely basis. In addition, manufacturers of our\nproducts are subject to cGMP and similar foreign standards and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by our manufacturers. If one of our contract manufacturers fails to maintain compliance, the production of our products could be interrupted, resulting in delays and additional costs. In addition, if the facilities of such manufacturers do not pass a pre-approval or post-approval plant inspection, the FDA will not grant approval and may institute restrictions on the marketing or sale of our products.\nOur manufacturing strategy presents the following additional risks:\n\u2022\nbecause most of our third-party manufacturers and formulators are located outside of the U.S., there may be difficulties in importing our products or their components into the U.S. as a result of, among other things, FDA import inspections, incomplete or inaccurate import documentation or defective packaging; and\n\u2022\nbecause of the complex nature of our products, our manufacturers may not be able to successfully manufacture our products in a cost-effective and/or timely manner.\nMaterials necessary to manufacture our products may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may delay the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products.\nWe and our partners rely on manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our products for clinical trials and commercialization. Suppliers may not sell these materials to such manufacturers at the times we or our partners need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these materials by these manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these materials. If the manufacturers are unable to obtain these materials for our or our partners\u2019 clinical trials, product testing, potential regulatory approval of our products and commercial scale manufacturing could be delayed, significantly affecting our and our partners\u2019 ability to further develop and commercialize our products. If we, our manufacturers or our partners, as applicable, are unable to purchase these materials for our products, there would be a shortage in supply or the commercial launch of such products would be delayed, which would materially and adversely affect our or our partners\u2019 ability to generate revenues from the sale of such products.\nIf we cannot identify, or enter into licensing arrangements for, new products, our ability to develop a diverse product portfolio will be limited.\nA component of our business strategy is acquiring rights to develop and commercialize products discovered or developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for which we may find effective uses and markets through our unique pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise for the treatment of central nervous system disorders. Competition for the acquisition of these products is intense. If we are not able to identify opportunities to acquire rights to commercialize additional products, we may not be able to develop a diverse portfolio of products and our business may be harmed. Additionally, it may take substantial human and financial resources to secure commercial rights to promising products. Moreover, if other firms develop pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics capabilities, we may face increased competition in identifying and acquiring additional products\nWe may not be successful in the development of products for our own account.\nIn addition to our business strategy of acquiring rights to develop and commercialize products, we may develop products for our own account by applying our technologies to off-patent drugs as well as developing our own proprietary molecules. Because we will be funding the development of such programs, there is a risk that we may not be able to continue to fund all such programs to completion or to provide the support necessary to perform the clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals or market any approved products. We expect the development of products for our own account to consume substantial resources. If we are able to develop commercial products on our own, the risks associated with these programs may be greater than those associated with our programs with collaborative partners.\nIf we lose key scientists or management personnel, or if we fail to recruit additional highly skilled personnel, it will impair our ability to identify, develop and commercialize products.\nWe are highly dependent on principal members of our management team and scientific staff, including our Chief Executive Officer, Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, M.D. These executives each have significant pharmaceutical industry experience. The loss of any such executives, including Dr. Polymeropoulos, or any other principal member of our management team or scientific staff, would impair our ability to identify, develop and market new products. Our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of these or other key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could result in delays to development or approval, loss of sales and diversion of management resources. In addition, we depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel, including research scientists. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the process of hiring and integrating such qualified personnel is often lengthy. We may be unable to recruit such personnel on a timely basis, if at all, which would negatively impact our development and commercialization programs.\nAdditionally, we do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on the lives of our executives or any of our employees. This lack of insurance means that we may not have adequate compensation for the loss of the services of these individuals.\nProduct liability lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our products.\nThe risk that we may be sued on product liability claims is inherent in the development and sale of pharmaceutical products. For example, we face a risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our products in clinical trials and will face even greater risks upon commercialization by us or our partners of our products. We believe that we may be at a greater risk of product liability claims relative to other pharmaceutical companies because our products are intended to treat central nervous system disorders, and it is possible that we may be held liable for the behavior and actions of patients who use our products. These lawsuits may divert our management from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend. In addition, if we are held liable in any of these lawsuits, we may incur substantial liabilities and we or our partners may be forced to limit or forego further commercialization of one or more of our products. Although we maintain product liability insurance, our aggregate coverage limit under this insurance is $20.0 million, and while we believe this amount of insurance is sufficient to cover our product liability exposure, these limits may not be high enough to fully cover potential liabilities. As our development activities and commercialization efforts progress and we and our partners sell our products, this coverage may be inadequate, we may be unable to obtain adequate coverage at an acceptable cost or we may be unable to get adequate coverage at all or our insurer may disclaim coverage as to a future claim. This could prevent the commercialization or limit the commercial potential of our products. Even if we are able to maintain insurance that we believe is adequate, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by a product liability claim. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of products liability litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Product liability litigation and other related proceedings may also require significant management time.\nEuropean Union and European Union Member States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nIn the European Union, prescription drug pricing and reimbursement is subject to governmental control and reimbursement mechanisms used by private and public health insurers in the European Union vary by Member State. For the public systems, reimbursement is determined by guidelines established by the legislator or responsible national authority. As elsewhere, inclusion in reimbursement catalogues focuses on the medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the health care system. Acceptance for reimbursement comes with cost, use and often volume restrictions, which can vary by member state. In those member states that impose price controls, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing\napproval in some member states, we or our partners may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies.\nSome member states require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some member states, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we or our partners might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular member state, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues that are generated from the sale of the product in that country. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, or if there is competition from lower priced cross-border sales, our profitability will be negatively affected.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may affect our or our partners\u2019 ability to sell our products profitably.\nThe continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our or our partners\u2019 ability to set prices for our products which we or our partners believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.\nSpecifically, in both the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our or our partners\u2019 ability to sell our products profitably. In the U.S., the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 reformed the way Medicare covered and provided reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. This legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we or our partners may receive for our products. Other third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. It will be time-consuming and expensive for us or our partners to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors. Our products may not be considered cost effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow the sale of such products on a competitive and profitable basis. Further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms are likely which could limit the prices that can be charged for the drugs we develop and may further limit our commercial opportunity. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the Medicare prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of this legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other healthcare reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, (PPACA), is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program, and the establishment of health care exchanges. Several provisions of the new law, which have varying effective dates, may affect us, and will likely increase certain of our costs. For example, an increase in the Medicaid rebate rate from 15.1% to 23.1% was effective as of January 1, 2010, and the volume of rebated drugs was expanded to include beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care organizations effective as of March 23, 2010. The PPACA also imposes an annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers which began in 2011, based on the manufacturer\u2019s sale of branded pharmaceuticals and biologics (excluding orphan drugs); expands the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs) including the creation of new penalties for non-compliance; and includes a 50% discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D participants in the coverage gap, or \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d. The law also revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes (effective October 1, 2010), which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added, which may require us to modify our business practices with health care practitioners.\nThe reforms imposed by PPACA significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry; however, the full effects of the PPACA cannot be known until these provisions are implemented and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and other federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance. Moreover, in the\ncoming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products. We will continue to evaluate the PPACA, as amended, the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the PPACA by federal agencies, as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and that may potentially impact on our business over time. These developments could, however, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn some foreign countries, including major markets in the European Union and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take nine to twelve months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies. Our business could be materially harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.\nOur business is subject to extensive governmental regulation and oversight and changes in laws could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. As a result, we may become subject to governmental actions which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to patent protection and enforcement, health care availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services or our business operations generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the tax laws relating to our operations.\nIn addition, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) included new authorization for the FDA to require post-market safety monitoring, along with a clinical trials registry, and expanded authority for the FDA to impose civil monetary penalties on companies that fail to meet certain commitments. The amendments, among other things, require some new drug applicants to submit risk evaluation and minimization strategies to monitor and address potential safety issues for products upon approval, grant the FDA the authority to impose risk management measures for marketed products and to mandate labeling changes in certain circumstances, and establish new requirements for disclosing the results of clinical trials. Companies that violate the law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. Additional measures have also been enacted to address the perceived shortcomings in the FDA\u2019s handling of drug safety issues, and to limit pharmaceutical company sales and promotional practices. While the FDAAA has had, and is expected to have, a substantial effect on the pharmaceutical industry, the full extent of that effect is not yet known. As the FDA issues further regulations, guidance and interpretations relating to this legislation, the impact on the industry as well as our business will become clearer. The requirements and other changes that the FDAAA imposes may make it more difficult, and likely more costly, to obtain approval of new pharmaceutical products and to produce, market and distribute existing products. Our ability to commercialize approved products successfully may be hindered, and our business may be harmed as a result.\nFuture transactions may harm our business or the market price of our stock.\nWe regularly review potential transactions related to technologies, products or product rights and businesses complementary to our business. These transactions could include:\n\u2022\nmergers;\n\u2022\nacquisitions;\n\u2022\nstrategic alliances;\n\u2022\nlicensing agreements; and\n\u2022\nco-promotion and similar agreements.\nWe may choose to enter into one or more of these transactions at any time, which may cause substantial fluctuations in the market price of our stock. Moreover, depending upon the nature of any transaction, we may experience a charge to earnings, which could also materially adversely affect our results of operations and could harm the market price of our stock.\nWe may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future, and difficulties integrating such acquisitions could damage our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nAlthough we have no experience in acquiring businesses, we may acquire businesses or assets that complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses with promising products or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to move one or more products through preclinical and/or clinical development to regulatory approval and commercialization. Integrating any newly acquired businesses or technologies could be expensive and time-consuming, resulting in the diversion of resources from our current business. We may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully. We cannot assure you that, following an acquisition, we will achieve revenues, specific net income or loss levels that justify the acquisition or that the acquisition will result in increased earnings, or reduced losses, for the combined company in any future period. Moreover, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to acquire any businesses, which would result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness and may not be available on terms which would otherwise be acceptable to us. We may not be able to operate acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement our growth strategy successfully.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors which make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations. The revenues we generate, if any, and our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nproduct sales;\n\u2022\ncost of product sales;\n\u2022\nmarketing and other expenses;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing or supply issues;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of royalties or milestone payments;\n\u2022\nour addition or termination of development programs;\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our products or future development programs;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting our products or those of our competitors; our execution of collaborative, licensing or other arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement or other lawsuit in which we may become involved; and\n\u2022\nthe timing and recognition of stock-based compensation expense.\nIf our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nRisks related to intellectual property and other legal matters\nOur rights to develop and commercialize our products are subject in part to the terms and conditions of licenses or sublicenses granted to us by other pharmaceutical companies.\nHETLIOZ\u00ae is based in part on patents that we have licensed on an exclusive basis and other intellectual property licensed from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS). BMS holds certain rights with respect to HETLIOZ\u00ae in the license agreement. Either party may terminate the license agreement under certain circumstances, including a material breach of the agreement by the other. In the event we terminate our license, or if BMS terminates our license due to our breach, all rights to HETLIOZ\u00ae (including any intellectual property we develop with respect to HETLIOZ\u00ae) licensed and developed by us under this agreement will revert or otherwise be licensed back to BMS on an exclusive basis. Any termination or reversion of our rights to develop or commercialize HETLIOZ\u00ae, including any reacquisition by BMS of our rights, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFanapt\u00ae is based in part on patents and other intellectual property owned by Sanofi. Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Titan) holds an exclusive license from Sanofi to the intellectual property owned by Sanofi, and Titan has sublicensed its rights under such license on an exclusive basis to Novartis. We acquired exclusive rights to this and other intellectual property through a further sublicense from Novartis. The sublicense with Novartis was amended and restated in October of 2009 to provide Novartis with exclusive rights to commercialize Fanapt\u00ae in the U.S. and Canada. We retained exclusive rights to Fanapt\u00ae outside the U.S. and Canada. We acquired all of Novartis\u2019 rights to Fanapt\u00ae in the fourth quarter of 2014 pursuant to an asset transfer agreement and related agreements with Novartis. We may lose our rights to develop and commercialize Fanapt\u00ae if we fail to comply with certain requirements in the Titan license agreement regarding our financial condition, or if we fail to comply with certain diligence obligations regarding our development or commercialization activities. Our loss of rights in Fanapt\u00ae would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTradipitant is based in part on patents that we have licensed on an exclusive basis and other intellectual property licensed from Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly). Lilly may terminate our license if we fail to use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tradipitant or if we materially breach the agreement and fail to cure that breach. In the event that we terminate our license, or if Lilly terminates our license for the reasons stated above, all of our rights to tradipitant (including any intellectual property we develop with respect to tradipitant) will revert back to Lilly, subject to payment by Lilly to us of a royalty on net sales of products that contain tradipitant.\nAQW051, to which we acquired rights from Novartis in the fourth quarter of 2014, is based on patents and other intellectual property that we have licensed on an exclusive basis from Novartis. Novartis may terminate our license if we materially breach the agreement, which includes an obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize AQW051, and fail to cure that breach. In the event that Novartis terminates our license for the reasons stated above, all of our rights to AQW051 (including any intellectual property we develop with respect to AQW051) will revert back to Novartis without compensation.\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our products are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an extension of patent term for drugs for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in development. Assuming we gain a five-year patent term restoration for HETLIOZ\u00ae, and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to this product, we would have exclusive rights to HETLIOZ\u00ae\u2019s U.S. \u201cnew chemical entity\u201d patent (the primary patent covering the product as a new composition of matter) until 2022. HETLIOZ\u00ae\u2019s U.S. \u201cmethod of use\u201d patent (the patent covering the method of treatment as described in the HETLIOZ\u00ae label approved by the FDA) expires normally in 2033. Fanapt\u00ae has qualified for the full five-year patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act and so the term of the new chemical entity patent in the U.S. has been extended until November 2016. In November 2013, a patent directed to a method of treating patients with Fanapt\u00ae based on genotype was issued to us by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This patent, which was listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book in January 2015, is set to expire in 2027, potentially further extending the exclusivity protection of Fanapt\u00ae under the Hatch-Waxman Act.\nMethod-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the method specified in the patent claims. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for a use that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products \u201coff-label.\u201d Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method of use patents, such infringement may be difficult to prevent.\nOur patents and patent applications may be challenged or fail to result in issued patents and our existing or future patents may be too narrow to prevent third parties from developing or designing around these patents. In addition, we generally rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect certain proprietary know-how that is not patentable, for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and for any other elements of our drug development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information and technology that is not covered by patent applications. While we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information and technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that this know-how, information and technology will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the U.S. and abroad. If we are unable to protect or defend the intellectual property related to our technologies, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar foreign legislation to extend our patents and to obtain market exclusivity for our products, our business will be harmed.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an extension of patent term for drugs for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in development. Assuming we gain a five-year patent term restoration for HETLIOZ\u00ae, and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to this product, we would have exclusive rights to HETLIOZ\u00ae\u2019s U.S. \u201cnew chemical entity\u201d patent (the primary patent covering the product as a new composition of matter) until 2022 and HETLIOZ\u00ae\u2019s U.S. \u201cmethod of use\u201d patent (the patent covering the method of treatment as described in the HETLIOZ\u00ae label approved by the FDA) until 2033. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products \u201coff-label.\u201d Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nIn August 2011, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a certificate of extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, extending by five years the term of Sanofi\u2019s new chemical entity patent relating to Fanapt\u00ae to November 2016. A directive in the European Union provides that companies that receive regulatory approval for a new product will have a 10-year period of market exclusivity for that product (with the possibility of a further one-year extension) in most countries in Europe, beginning on the date of such European regulatory approval, regardless of when the European new chemical entity patent covering such product expires. A generic version of the approved drug may not be marketed or sold in Europe during such market exclusivity period. This directive is of material importance with respect to Fanapt\u00ae, since the European new chemical entity patent for Fanapt\u00ae has expired. Assuming we gain a five-year patent term restoration for tradipitant, and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to this product, we would have exclusive rights to tradipitant\u2019s U.S. new chemical entity patent until 2029. Assuming we gain a five-year patent term restoration for AQW051, and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to this product, we would have exclusive rights to AQW051\u2019s U.S. new chemical entity patent until 2028.\nHowever, there is no assurance that we will receive the extensions of our patents or other exclusive rights available under the Hatch-Waxman Act or similar foreign legislation. If we fail to receive such extensions or exclusive rights, our or our partners\u2019 ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling generic versions of our products will be materially impaired.\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to divert resources and may prevent or delay our drug discovery and development efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents.\nFurthermore, parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop and commercialize one or more of our products. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would divert substantial financial and employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, obtain one or more licenses from third parties or pay royalties. In addition, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain additional licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our products. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to develop and commercialize further one or more of our products.\nIn addition, in the future we could be required to initiate litigation to enforce our proprietary rights against infringement by third parties. Prosecution of these claims to enforce our rights against others could divert substantial financial and employee resources from our business. If we fail to enforce our proprietary rights against others, our business will be harmed.\nIn November 2013, Novartis brought a patent infringement action against Roxane. The suit alleges that Roxane\u2019s filing of an ANDA for generic iloperidone with a paragraph IV certification infringes Sanofi\u2019s new chemical entity patent. Roxane is defending on the grounds that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable or that certain patent claims are not infringed. Roxane also filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the court lacks jurisdiction. At present, approval of Roxane\u2019s ANDA is stayed for 30 months from the end of the data exclusivity period for iloperidone, i.e., until November 2016. If Roxane prevails on its defenses or on its motion to dismiss, Roxane could be allowed to launch a generic iloperidone product prior to expiration of the 30 months stay.\nUpon acquisition of Novartis\u2019 rights in Fanapt\u00ae, we assumed responsibility for this litigation. In addition to the risk that Roxane will prevail on its defenses or on its motion to dismiss, the litigation may divert substantial financial and employee resources from our business. It is also possible that a counterclaim will expose us to financial liability.\nIn June 2014, we brought a patent infringement action against Roxane for infringement of a Vanda patent, U.S. Patent No. 8,586,610, which, in general terms, relates to altering the dose of iloperidone based on a patient\u2019s CYP2D6 genotype. Roxane filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the claims are directed to a law of nature and are therefore patent ineligible. The law with respect to patent eligibility of methods of use that rely on genotype or other biomarker is evolving and uncertain.\nRisks related to our common stock\nOur stock price has been highly volatile and may be volatile in the future, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors or other unforeseen risks could have a dramatic and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014, the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global Market varied between $8.34 and $19.25 per share. Additionally, market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including ours, have historically been very volatile. The market for these securities has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons that were unrelated to the operating performance of any one company.\nThe following factors, in addition to the other risk factors described in this section, may also have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nour or our partners\u2019 ability to successfully commercialize our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully execute our commercialization strategies;\n\u2022\npublicity regarding actual or potential testing or trial results relating to products under development by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of regulatory review relating to products under development by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning any collaboration or other strategic transaction we may undertake;\n\u2022\nannouncements of patent issuances or denials, technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ntermination or delay of development or commercialization program(s) by our partners;\n\u2022\nsafety issues with our products or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products or methods by us or others;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts or failure to meet such financial expectations;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations or policies;\n\u2022\nchanges in patent legislation or patent decisions or adverse changes to patent law;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel or members of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nfinancial guidance or business updates we may provide;\n\u2022\nannouncements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations or guidance we may provide;\n\u2022\nthe publication of negative research or articles about our company, our business or our products by industry analysts or others;\n\u2022\npublicity regarding actual or potential transactions involving us; and\n\u2022\neconomic, political and other external factors beyond our control.\nWe may be subject to litigation, which could harm our stock price, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have been the subject of litigation in the past and may be subject to litigation in the future. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock, many companies, including us, have been the subjects of securities class action litigation. Any such litigation can result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business results of operations and financial condition. As a result of these factors, holders of our common stock might be unable to sell their shares at or above the price they paid for such shares.\nIf there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline.\nA small number of institutional investors and equity funds hold a significant number of shares of our common stock. Sales by these stockholders of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation of such sales, could cause a significant reduction in the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition to our outstanding common stock, as of December 31, 2014, there were a total of 7,905,883 shares of common stock that we have registered and that we are obligated to issue upon the exercise of currently outstanding options and settlement of restricted stock unit awards granted under our Second Amended and Restated Management Equity Plan and 2006 Equity Incentive Plan. Upon the exercise of these options or settlement of the shares underlying these restricted stock units, as the case may be, in accordance with their respective terms, these shares may be resold freely, subject to restrictions imposed on our affiliates under Rule 144. If significant sales of these shares occur in short periods of time, these sales could reduce the market\nprice of our common stock. Any reduction in the trading price of our common stock could impede our ability to raise capital on attractive terms, if at all.\nIf we fail to maintain the requirements for continued listing on The NASDAQ Global Market, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which would adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed for quotation on The NASDAQ Global Market. We are required to meet specified listing criteria in order to maintain our listing on The NASDAQ Global Market. If we fail to satisfy The NASDAQ Global Market\u2019s continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market, in which case we may transfer to The NASDAQ Capital Market, which generally has lower financial requirements for initial listing or, if we fail to meet its listing requirements, the over-the-counter bulletin board. Any potential delisting of our common stock from The NASDAQ Global Market would make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our stock in the public market and would likely result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility for our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in the purchase of our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in previous offerings. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in previous offerings, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in previous offerings.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\nProxy contests have been waged against many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including us, over the last several years. If faced with a proxy contest or other type of shareholder activism, we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or dispute, which would be disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business could be adversely affected by a proxy contest or shareholder dispute involving us or our partners because:\n\u2022\nresponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and employees;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to future direction may result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or in-licensing opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and\n\u2022\nif individuals are elected to a board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders.\nThese actions could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws, and in Delaware law, and our rights plan could prevent or delay a change in control of our company.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u2022\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nMoreover, in September 2008, our board of directors adopted a rights agreement, the provisions of which could result in significant dilution of the proportionate ownership of a potential acquirer and, accordingly, could discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us.\nProlonged economic uncertainties or downturns, as well as unstable market, credit and financial conditions, may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business and have serious adverse consequences on our business.\nThe global economic downturn and market instability has made the business climate more volatile and more costly. These economic conditions, and uncertainty as to the general direction of the macroeconomic environment, are beyond our control and may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. While we believe we have adequate capital resources to meet current working capital and capital expenditure requirements, a lingering economic downturn or significant increase in our expenses could require additional financing on less than attractive rates or on terms that are excessively dilutive to existing stockholders. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans.\nSales of our products will be dependent, in large part, on reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, distribution partners and other organizations. As a result of negative trends in the general economy in the U.S. or other jurisdictions in which we may do business, these organizations may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment. In addition, federal and state health authorities may reduce Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, and private insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively affect our or our partners\u2019 product sales and revenue.\nIn addition, we rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business. For example, we use third parties for sales, distribution, medical affairs and clinical research, and we rely upon several single source providers of raw materials and contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products. During challenging and uncertain economic times and in tight credit markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors, suppliers or partners. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 91186, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "VNDA"}
