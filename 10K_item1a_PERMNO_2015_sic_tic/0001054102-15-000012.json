RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes in Part II. - Item 8, you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our business, operations and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or businesses in general, such as competitive conditions, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nINTERPACE DIAGNOSTICS RISKS:\nOur Interpace Diagnostics segment has limited revenue, and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn 2014, we acquired RedPath and certain assets from Asuragen. As a result, our Interpace Diagnostics segment now offers PancraGen\u2122 and ThyGenX. We also have three diagnostic tests in late stage development that are designed to detect genetic alterations that are associated with gastrointestinal cancers and one diagnostic test in late stage development that is designed to detect genetic alterations that are associated with endocrine cancers. The revenue generated from our Interpace Diagnostics segment was $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, or 1.2% of our consolidated revenue. Although we expect the revenue generated from our Interpace Diagnostics segment to grow significantly in the future there can be no assurance that this will achieve revenue sufficient to offset expenses. Over the next several years, we expect to continue to devote resources to increase adoption of, and reimbursement for, our molecular diagnostic tests and to develop and acquire additional diagnostic solutions. Our Interpace Diagnostics segment may never achieve or sustain profitability, and our failure to achieve and sustain profitability in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial results of our Interpace Diagnostics segment currently depend solely on sales of our molecular diagnostic tests, and we will need to generate sufficient revenue from these and other diagnostic solutions that we develop or acquire to grow our business.\nAll of our revenue from our Interpace Diagnostics segment has been derived from the sale of our molecular diagnostic tests, which we launched commercially in the second half of 2014. We have additional molecular diagnostics tests in various stages of research and development, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize these tests. If we are unable to increase sales of our molecular diagnostic tests, expand reimbursement for these tests, or successfully develop and commercialize other molecular diagnostic tests, our revenue and our ability to achieve and sustain profitability would be impaired, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business strategy involves investing in diagnostic opportunities, which could adversely affect near-term operating results and if not successful, we may not meet our objectives of developing additional recurring and higher margin revenue.\nOur business strategy involves an emphasis on in-licensing, acquiring or partnering on product-based opportunities that leverage our extensive product commercialization expertise for the molecular diagnostics industry. These types of opportunities required us to raise and invest capital resources, to acquire licenses or other rights in products, to assess the prospects for commercial\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nsuccess of products we invested in, and incur additional expenses. Compared to our Commercial Services segment, these activities carry greater risks and uncertainties concerning the ability to achieve additional revenues and profits, may take longer to achieve revenues and profits and therefore may have a short-term adverse effect on profitability.\nPotential risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative and competing tests or products and technological innovations or other advances in medicine and our ability to compete with them;\n\u2022\npricing pressures, lower prices offered by competitors, or changes in third-party payor, government payor or private insurer reimbursement policies including potential delays or refusals to pay and uncertainty related to changes in billing codes (CPT codes);\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain sufficient intellectual property rights in our products;\n\u2022\nparties infringing our intellectual property rights or operating outside our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe labs we use being subject to routine governmental oversight and inspections for continued operation pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, to process tests ordered by physicians;\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable Federal and State regulations governing laboratory testing in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nthe accuracy rates of such tests, including rates of false negatives and/or false positives;\n\u2022\nconcerns regarding the safety and effectiveness or clinical validity of tests;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment affecting health care and health care providers, including changes in laws regulating laboratory testing and/or device manufacturers;\n\u2022\ngeneral changes or developments in the market for molecular diagnostics;\n\u2022\nidentifying tests that can be performed at a reasonable cost;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund necessary research and development activities; and\n\u2022\nour ability to increase commercial acceptance of our molecular diagnostic tests.\nThere can be no assurance that execution of our strategies, which are intended to diversify our business, will achieve our objectives of adding revenues and increasing margins, either as to amount or timing.\nIf payors do not provide reimbursement or if we are unable to successfully negotiate reimbursement contracts, our commercial success could be compromised.\nPhysicians may not order our tests unless payors reimburse a substantial portion of the test price. There is uncertainty concerning third-party reimbursement of any test incorporating new molecular diagnostic technology. Reimbursement by a payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that tests such as our molecular diagnostic tests are: (a) not experimental or investigational; (b) appropriate for the patient; (c) cost-effective; (d) supported by peer-reviewed publications; and (e) included in clinical practice guidelines. Since each payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to reimburse our test, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. We have a contracted rate of reimbursement with some payors. Without a contracted rate for reimbursement, claims may be denied upon submission, and we need to appeal the claims. The appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and may not result in payment. We expect to continue to focus resources on increasing adoption of and coverage and reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests. We cannot, however, predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payors will reimburse for our molecular diagnostic tests, it at all. In addition, the launch of our molecular diagnostic tests in our PathFinderTG\u00ae and miRInform\u2122 platforms and any other new products we may acquire or develop in the future may require that we expend substantial time and resources in order to obtain and retain reimbursement. If we fail to establish broad adoption of and reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests, or if we are unable to maintain existing reimbursement from payors, our ability to generate revenue could be harmed and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nWe may experience limits on our revenue if physicians decide not to order our molecular diagnostic tests.\nIf we are unable to create or maintain demand for our molecular diagnostic tests in sufficient volume, we may not become profitable. To generate demand, we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our molecular diagnostic tests in order to change clinical practices through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education by our internal sales force. In addition, our ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors will be critical to generating revenue. In many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended therapies or surgery to determine if a patient\u2019s condition is malignant or benign. Accordingly, physicians may be reluctant to order a diagnostic test that may suggest surgery is unnecessary. In addition, our Interpace Diagnostics are performed at our laboratories rather than by a pathologist in a local laboratory, so pathologists may be reluctant to support our molecular diagnostic tests. In addition, guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid nodules may change to recommend another type of treatment protocol, and these changes may result in medical practitioners deciding not to use our molecular diagnostic tests. These facts may make physicians reluctant to convert to using our molecular diagnostic tests, which could limit our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience limits on our revenue if patients decide not to use our molecular diagnostic tests.\nSome patients may decide not to use our molecular diagnostic tests due to price, all or part of which may be payable directly by the patient if the patient\u2019s insurer denies reimbursement in full or in part. Many insurers seek to shift more of the cost of healthcare to patients in the form of higher co-payments or premiums. In addition, the current economic environment in the United States has and may continue to result in the loss of healthcare coverage. Implementation of provisions of PPACA also resulted in the loss of health insurance, and increases in premiums and reductions in coverage, for some patients. These events may result in patients delaying or forgoing medical checkups or treatment due to their inability to pay for our test, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue.\nIf our internal sales force is less successful than anticipated, our business expansion plans could suffer and our ability to generate revenues could be diminished. In addition, we have limited history selling our molecular diagnostics tests on a direct basis and our limited history makes forecasting difficult.\nIf our internal sales force is not successful, or new additions to our sales team fail to gain traction among our customers, we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our molecular diagnostic tests. If we fail to establish our molecular diagnostic tests in the marketplace, it could have a negative effect on our ability to sell subsequent molecular diagnostic tests and hinder the desired expansion of our business. We have limited historical experience forecasting the direct sales of our molecular diagnostics products. Our ability to produce product quantities that meet customer demand is dependent upon our ability to forecast accurately, plan production accordingly and scale our manufacturing efforts.\nWe rely on sole suppliers for some of the materials used in our molecular diagnostic tests, and we may not be able to find replacements or transition to alternative suppliers in a timely manner.\nWe rely on sole suppliers for certain materials that we use to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, including Asuragen for our endocrine cancer diagnostic tests pursuant to our supply agreement with them. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or the alternative sources will be available in a timely manner. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform our molecular diagnostic tests and for our collection kits, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, an interruption in test processing could occur. Any such interruption may directly impact our revenue and cause us to incur higher costs.\nIf we are unable to support demand for our molecular diagnostic tests or any of our future tests or solutions, our business could suffer.\nAs demand for our molecular diagnostic tests or any of our future diagnostic tests or solutions grows, we will need to continue to scale our testing capacity and processing technology, expand customer service, billing and systems processes and enhance our internal quality assurance program. We will also need additional certified laboratory scientists and other scientific and technical personnel to process higher volumes of our molecular diagnostic tests. We cannot assure you that increases in scale, related improvements and quality assurance will be implemented successfully or that appropriate personnel will be available. Failure to implement necessary procedures, transition to new processes or hire the necessary personnel could result in higher costs of processing tests or inability to meet demand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to perform our testing on a timely basis at a level consistent with demand, or that our efforts to scale our operations will not negatively affect the quality of test results. If we encounter difficulty meeting market demand or quality standards, our reputation could be harmed and our future\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nprospects and our business could suffer, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve profitability.\nWe compete with physicians and the medical community who use traditional methods to diagnose gastrointestinal and endocrine cancers. In many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended therapies or surgery to determine if a patient\u2019s condition is malignant or benign. As a result, we believe that we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our molecular diagnostic tests in order to change clinical practices. In addition, we face competition from other companies that offer diagnostic tests. Specifically, in regard to our thyroid diagnostic tests, Veracyte has thyroid nodule cancer diagnostic tests that compete with our ThyGenX\u2122 test, which is currently on the market, and our ThyraMir\u2122 test, which we intend to bring to the market by the second half of 2015, and Veracyte is developing additional tests aimed at FNAs for thyroid cancer. Quest currently offers a diagnostic test similar to the earlier version of our ThyGenX\u2122 test and CBL is offering a diagnostic test that analyzes genetic alterations using next-generation sequencing.\nIt is also possible that we face future competition from LDTs developed by commercial laboratories such as Quest and LabCorp and/or other diagnostic companies developing new tests or technologies. Furthermore, we may be subject to competition as a result of the new, unforeseen technologies that can be developed by our competitors in the gastrointestinal and endocrine cancer molecular diagnostic tests space.\nTo compete successfully we must be able to demonstrate, among other things, that our molecular diagnostic test results are accurate and cost effective, and we must secure a meaningful level of reimbursement for our test. Since our Interpace Diagnostics segment began in 2014, many of our potential competitors have stronger brand recognition and greater financial capabilities than we do. Others may develop a test with a lower price than ours that could be viewed by physicians and payors as functionally equivalent to our molecular diagnostic tests, or offer a test at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the price of our molecular diagnostic tests, which would affect our ability to achieve and maintain profitability. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance of our molecular diagnostic tests and overall sales, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nDeveloping new molecular diagnostic tests involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may not be able to commercialize on a timely basis, or at all, other molecular diagnostic tests we are developing.\nDeveloping new molecular diagnostic tests and solutions will require us to devote considerable resources to research and development. We may face challenges obtaining sufficient numbers of samples to validate a newly acquired or developed molecular diagnostic test. In order to develop and commercialize molecular diagnostic tests, we need to:\n\u2022expend significant funds to conduct substantial research and development;\n\u2022conduct successful analytical and clinical studies;\n\u2022scale our laboratory processes to accommodate new molecular diagnostic tests; and\n\u2022build the commercial infrastructure to market and sell new molecular diagnostic tests.\nTypically, few research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in early clinical studies often is not replicated in later studies. At any point, we may abandon development of a molecular diagnostic test or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical studies, which would adversely affect the timing for generating revenue such new test. If a clinical validation study fails to demonstrate the prospectively defined endpoints of the study or if we fail to sufficiently demonstrate analytical validity, we might choose to abandon the development of the molecular diagnostic test, which could harm our business. In addition, competitors may develop and commercialize competing molecular diagnostic tests faster than us or at a lower cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop or acquire molecular diagnostic tests to keep pace with rapid technological, medical and scientific change, our operating results and competitive position could be affected.\nRecently, there have been numerous advances in technologies relating to diagnostics, particularly diagnostics that are based on genomic information. These advances require us to continuously develop our technology and to work to develop new solutions to keep pace with evolving standards of care. Our solutions could become obsolete unless we continually innovate and expand our product offerings to include new clinical applications. If we are unable to develop or acquire new molecular diagnostic tests or to demonstrate the applicability of our molecular diagnostic tests for other diseases, our sales could decline and our competitive position could be harmed.\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nIf the FDA were to begin regulating our molecular diagnostic tests, we could incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain premarket clearance or approval.\nClinical laboratory tests like our molecular diagnostic tests are regulated under CLIA as well as by applicable State laws. Most LDTs are currently not subject to FDA regulation (although reagents, instruments, software or components provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to regulation). Although the FDA has never defined what qualifies as an LDT, we believe that our molecular diagnostic tests are LDTs. As a result, we believe our molecular diagnostic tests should not be subject to regulation in accordance with the FDA\u2019s current policy of exercising enforcement discretion regarding LDTs. The FDA has indicated that it may revisit its current policy and planned to issue guidance that, when finalized, would adopt a risk-based framework that would increase FDA oversight of LDTs. The proposals were subject to public comment until February 2, 2015. We cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation will not be required in the future for our tests, whether through additional guidance or regulations issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. It is possible that legislation will be enacted into law, regulations could be promulgated or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in increased regulatory burdens for us to continue to offer our molecular diagnostic tests or to develop and introduce new tests. We cannot predict the timing or content of future legislation enacted, regulations promulgated or guidance issued regarding LDTs, or how it will affect our business. If premarket review is required by the FDA or if we decide to voluntarily pursue FDA premarket review of our tests, there can be no assurance that our molecular diagnostic tests or any tests we may develop or acquire in the future will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, nor can there be assurance that labeling claims will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our tests. If our tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty in the marketplace about our tests, if we are required by the FDA to label them investigational, or if labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are limited, orders may decline and reimbursement may be adversely affected. Continued compliance with FDA regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to heightened regulation by the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. We cannot predict the timing or form of any such guidance or regulation, or the potential effect on our existing molecular diagnostic tests or our tests in development, or the potential impact of such guidance or regulation on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with Federal, State and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business.\nWe are subject to CLIA, a Federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. CLIA regulations mandate specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management and quality assurance. CLIA certification is also required in order for us to be eligible to bill Federal and State healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payors, for our molecular diagnostic tests. To renew these certifications, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of our clinical reference laboratories. We are also required to maintain State licenses to conduct testing in our New Haven laboratory. Connecticut law requires that we maintain a license and establishes standards for the day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratory in New Haven Connecticut. In addition, our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories are required to be licensed on a test-specific basis by California and New York. California and New York laws also mandate proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under California and New York State laws, respectively, regardless of whether such laboratories are located in California or New York. We are currently in the process of obtaining licenses from Florida, Maryland and Rhode Island. If we were to lose our CLIA certificate or State licenses for our laboratories, whether as a result of revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nPPACA makes changes that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical, medical device and clinical laboratory industries. Some of the significant measures contained in PPACA include, for example, a sales tax on medical devices listed with the FDA and a reduction in certain payments for clinical references laboratories. PPACA further includes significant fraud and abuse measures, including required disclosures of financial arrangements with physician customers, lower thresholds for violations and increasing potential penalties for such violations. In addition, PPACA establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending.\nMoreover, we do not believe that our laboratories are currently subject to the disclosure requirements contained in PPACA because they do not currently meet the definition of an \u201cApplicable Manufacturer\u201d under PPACA. However, as new regulations are implemented and diagnostic tests reclassified, this may change and the laboratory business may be subject to PPACA as are other\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\ncompanies. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that our interpretation of the PPACA is now or will be in the future consistent with government guidance and interpretation.\nWe are monitoring the effect of PPACA to determine the trends and changes that may be necessitated by the legislation, any of which may potentially affect our business. In addition to PPACA, the effect of which on our business cannot presently be fully quantified, various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged from Federal and State governments, the impact of which is difficult to determine.\nComplying with numerous statutes and regulations pertaining to our Interpace Diagnostics segment is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.\nWe are subject to regulation by both the Federal government and the States in which we conduct our Interpace Diagnostics segment, including:\n\u2022The FDC Act, as supplemented by various other statutes;\n\u2022The PDMA;\n\u2022CLIA and State licensing requirements;\n\u2022Manufacturing and promotion laws;\n\u2022Billing and payment regulations applicable to clinical laboratories;\n\u2022the Federal anti-kickback law and State anti-kickback prohibitions;\n\u2022the Federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, and State law equivalents;\n\u2022HIPAA and other fraud and privacy regulations;\n\u2022the Medicare civil money penalty and exclusion requirements;\n\u2022the Federal False Claims Act civil and criminal penalties and State equivalents; and\n\u2022Spam and Junk Fax Laws.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations. We periodically conduct internal reviews of our compliance with these laws. Our compliance is also subject to governmental review. The growth of our business and commercialization organization may increase the potential of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, we could be required to refund payments received by us, and we could even be required to cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure to comply with Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to our payment practices could result in substantial penalties.\nWe retain healthcare practitioners as key opinion leaders providing consultation in various aspects of our business. These arrangements as any arrangement that includes compensation to a healthcare provider may trigger Federal or State anti-kickback and Stark Law liability. All arrangements are designed to meet available safe harbors and exceptions provided in the anti-kickback laws and Stark Laws, respectively. However, there are no guarantees that the Federal or State governments will find that these arrangements are designed properly or that they do not trigger liability under Federal and State laws. Under existing laws, all arrangement must have a legitimate purpose and compensation must be fair market value. These terms require some subjective analysis and there is limited available case law or guidance for the application of these laws to the CLIA laboratory industry. Safe harbors in the anti-kickback laws do not necessarily equate to exceptions in the Stark Law, and there is no guarantee that the government will agree with our payment practices with respect to the relationships between our laboratories and the healthcare providers.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury, we could be liable for resulting damages.\nWe are subject to Federal, State and local laws, rules and regulations governing the use, discharge, storage, handling and disposal of biological material, chemicals and waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, remediation costs and any related penalties or fines, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nsignificant, and our failure to comply may result in substantial fines or other consequences, and either could have a significant impact on our operating results.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions to us or our third-party service providers could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nOur business requires that we and our third-party service providers collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personally identifiable information about patients, credit card information, and our proprietary business and financial information. We face a number of risks relative to our protection of, and our service providers\u2019 protection of, this critical information, including loss of access, inappropriate disclosure and inappropriate access, as well as risks associated with our ability to identify and audit such events. The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or otherwise breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other activities. While we have not experienced any such attack or breach, if such event would occur and cause interruptions in our operations, our networks would be compromised and the information we store on those networks could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could disrupt our operations, including our ability to process tests, provide test results, bill payors or patients, process claims, provide customer assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process and prepare company financial information, provide information about our solution and other patient and physician education and outreach efforts through our website, manage the administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related and data protection laws in the United States are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nIf we breach the Asuragen License Agreement or the CPRIT License Agreement, it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our miRInform\u2122 thyroid and pancreas cancer diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, and the sale of diagnostic devices and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer.\nWe currently license certain patents and know-how from Asuragen relating to (i) miRInform\u2122 thyroid and pancreas cancer diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, and (ii) the sale of diagnostic devices and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer. No royalty or other payments or fees are payable under the Asuragen License Agreement. Under the CPRIT License Agreement, we are obligated to pay 5% of net sales on sales of diagnostic devices and the performance of services relating to thyroid cancer, subject to a maximum deduction of 1.5% for royalties paid to third parties. Both of the Asuragen License Agreement and the CPRIT License Agreement continue until terminated by (i) mutual agreement of the parties or (ii) either party in the event of material breach of the respective agreement by the other party. If we materially breach or fail to perform any provision under these license agreements, Asuragen will have the right to terminate our licenses, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to practice the licensed patent rights would end. To the extent such licensed patent rights relate to our molecular diagnostic tests currently on the market, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights and other technology licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under these license agreements could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under these license agreements, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our molecular diagnostic tests currently on the market, it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our commercialization efforts for our miRInform\u2122 thyroid and pancreas cancer diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, and the sale of diagnostic devices and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively, our business would be harmed.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. These efforts provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us and we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property. While we apply for patents covering our products and technologies and uses thereof, we may fail to apply for patents on important products and technologies in a timely fashion or at all, or we may fail to apply for patents in relevant jurisdictions. Others could seek to design around our current or future patented technologies. We may not be successful in\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\ndefending any challenges made against our patents or patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents and increased competition to our business. The outcome of patent litigation can be uncertain and any attempt by us to enforce our patent rights against others may not be successful, or, if successful, may take substantial time and result in substantial cost, and may divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nThe patent positions of companies engaged in the development and commercialization of molecular diagnostic tests, like our molecular diagnostic tests in our PathFinderTG\u00ae and miRInform\u2122 platforms, are particularly uncertain. The U.S. Supreme Court and district courts have recently rendered decisions that affect the scope of patentability of certain inventions or discoveries relating to certain diagnostic tests and related methods. These decisions State, among other things, that patent claims that solely recite laws of nature without an additional inventive concept are not themselves patentable. What constitutes a law of nature and a sufficient inventive concept remains uncertain, and it is possible that certain aspects of molecular diagnostics tests would be considered natural laws. Accordingly, the evolving interpretation of patent laws in the United States governing the eligibility of diagnostics for patent protection may adversely affect our ability to obtain patents and may facilitate third-party challenges to any owned and licensed patents. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforceable in our patents or in third-party patents. We may not develop or acquire additional proprietary products, methods and technologies that are patentable.\nMonitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to enforce a claim that a third-party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Further, competitors could willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that arguably fall outside of our intellectual property rights. Others may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or replicate any of our products and technologies. If our intellectual property does not adequately protect us against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business and the results of our operations. To the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our overall business. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive.\nWe may be involved in litigation related to intellectual property, which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may receive notices of claims of direct or indirect infringement or misappropriation or misuse of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights from time to time and some of these claims may lead to litigation. We cannot assume that we will prevail in such actions, or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third-party trade secrets, infringement by us of third-party patents and trademarks or other rights, or the validity of our patents, trademarks or other rights, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. We might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. No assurance can be given that other patent applications will not have priority over our patent applications. If third parties bring these proceedings against our patents, we could incur significant costs and experience management distraction. Litigation may be necessary for us to enforce our patent and proprietary rights or to determine the scope, coverage and validity of the proprietary rights of others. The outcome of any litigation or other proceeding is inherently uncertain and might not be favorable to us, and we might not be able to obtain licenses to technology that we require on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity, scope and coverage of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail. Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and ongoing royalties, and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling our products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. We could incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, our agreements with some of our customers, suppliers or other entities with whom we do business require us to defend or indemnify these parties to the extent they become involved in infringement claims, including the types of claims described above. If we are required or agree to defend or indemnify third parties in connection with any infringement claims, we could incur significant costs and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nIf we are sued for product liability or errors and omissions liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale and use of our molecular diagnostic tests could lead to product liability claims if someone were to allege that the test failed to perform as it was designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the results we provide to physicians or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. A product liability or errors and omissions liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming for us to defend. Although we maintain product liability and errors and omissions insurance, we cannot be certain that our insurance would fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against these types of claims or any judgments, fines or settlement costs arising out of such claims. Any product liability or errors and omissions liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation or cause us to suspend sales of our products and solutions. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will need to grow the size and complexity of our organization as a result of our acquisition of RedPath and certain assets from Asuragen, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth or in maintaining our focus on our Commercial Services and Interpace Diagnostics segments, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\nAs a result of adding our Interpace Diagnostics segments in 2014, we will need to increase the size and complexity of our organization to assist with the expansion of our operations. The anticipated future growth of our business will impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. In addition, rapid and significant growth may place strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. Our ability to manage our business and growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. Our failure to manage this growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to effectively service and/or provide molecular diagnostic tests to our customers, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBilling for our diagnostic solution is complex, and we must dedicate substantial time and resources to the billing process to be paid for our test.\nBilling for clinical laboratory testing services is complex, time consuming and expensive. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payors, including Medicare, insurance companies and patients, all of which have different billing requirements. To the extent laws or contracts require us to bill patient co-payments or co-insurance, we must also comply with these requirements. We may also face increased risk in our collection efforts, including write-offs of doubtful accounts and long collection cycles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Among others, the following factors make the billing process complex:\n\u2022differences between the list price for our molecular diagnostic tests and the reimbursement rates of payors;\n\u2022compliance with complex Federal and State regulations related to billing Medicare;\n\u2022disputes among payors as to which party is responsible for payment;\n\u2022differences in coverage among payors and the effect of patient co-payments or co-insurance;\n\u2022differences in information and billing requirements among payors;\n\u2022incorrect or missing billing information; and\n\u2022the resources required to manage the billing and claims appeals process.\nAs we introduce new molecular diagnostic tests, we will need to add new codes to our billing process as well as our financial reporting systems. Failure or delays in effecting these changes in external billing and internal systems and processes could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow. Additionally, our billing activities require us to implement compliance procedures and oversight, train and monitor our employees, challenge coverage and payment denials, assist patients in appealing claims, and undertake internal audits to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures. Payors also conduct external audits to evaluate payments, which add further complexity to the billing process. These billing complexities, and the related uncertainty in obtaining payment for our diagnostic solution, could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow, our ability to achieve profitability, and the consistency and comparability of our results of operations.\nWe rely on a third-party to process and transmit claims to payors, and any delay in either could have an adverse effect on our revenue.\nWe rely on a third-party provider to provide overall processing of claims and to transmit the actual claims to payors based on the specific payor billing format. If claims for our molecular diagnostic tests are not submitted to payors on a timely basis, or if we\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nare required to switch to a different provider to handle claim submissions, we may experience delays in our ability to process these claims and receipt of payments from payors, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCOMMERCIAL SERVICES RISKS:\nOur Commercial Services contracts are generally cancelable at any time, which may result in lost revenue and additional costs and expenses.\nOur Commercial Services contracts are generally for a term of one to three years (certain of our contracts have a shorter duration) and many may be terminated by the customer at any time for any reason. In addition, many of our customers may internalize the contracted sales teams we provide under the terms of the contract or otherwise significantly reduce the number of sales representatives we deploy on their behalf. The early termination or significant reduction of a contract by one of our customers not only would result in lost revenue, but also cause us to incur additional costs and expenses, such as termination expenses relating to excess employee capacity. All of our sales representatives are employees rather than independent contractors. Accordingly, when a contract is significantly reduced or terminated, unless we can immediately transfer the related sales force to a new program, if permitted under the contract, we must either continue to compensate those employees, without realizing any related revenue, or terminate their employment. If we terminate their employment, we may incur significant expenses relating to their termination. The loss, termination or significant reduction of a large contract or the loss or termination of multiple contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we do not meet performance goals established in our incentive-based arrangements with our Commercial Services customers, or potential future revenue-sharing arrangements with customers, our revenue could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have entered into a number of incentive-based arrangements with our Commercial Services customers. Under incentive-based arrangements, we are typically paid a lower fixed fee and, in addition, have an opportunity to earn additional compensation upon achieving specific performance goals with respect to the products being detailed. Typically, these performance goals relate to targeted sales or prescription volumes, sales force performance metrics or a combination thereof. In addition, although not currently a party to such arrangements, we have entered into revenue sharing arrangements in the past and may in the future enter into revenue sharing arrangements with customers. Under revenue sharing arrangements, we have been typically paid a fixed fee covering all or a portion of our direct costs with our remaining compensation based on the market performance of the products being promoted by us, usually expressed as a percentage of product sales. These incentive-based and revenue sharing arrangements transfer some or most of the market risk from our customers to us. In addition, these arrangements can result in variability in revenue and earnings due to seasonality of product usage, changes in market share, new product introductions (including the introduction of competing generic products into the market), overall promotional efforts and other market-related factors. If we are unable to meet the future performance goals established in our incentive-based arrangements or the market performance goals in our revenue sharing arrangements, our revenue could be materially and adversely affected. During the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K the revenue at risk under performance goals was not material to the Company.\nAdditionally, certain of our service contracts may contain penalty provisions pursuant to which our fixed fees may be significantly reduced if we do not meet certain minimum performance metrics, which may include the number and timing of sales calls, physician reach, territory vacancies and/or sales representative turnover.\nChanges in outsourcing trends in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology or healthcare industries could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Commercial Services segment depends, in large part, on demand from the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare industries for outsourced promotional services. The practice of many companies in these industries has been to hire outside organizations like PDI to conduct large sales and marketing projects on their behalf. However, companies may elect to perform these services internally for a variety of reasons, including the rate of new product development and FDA approval of those products, the number of sales representatives employed internally in relation to demand, the need to promote new and existing products, and competition from other suppliers. We have previously impacted significantly and adversely in previous years when several large pharmaceutical companies made changes to their commercial model by reducing the number of sales representatives employed internally and through outside organizations like PDI. These and other developments within the pharmaceutical industry have resulted in volatility in the market for outsourced sales and marketing services during the last few years, and there can be no assurances regarding the continuation, timing or extent of any changes of these trends. If companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology or healthcare industries reduce their demand for outsourcing services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nIf companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology or healthcare industries significantly reduce their promotional, marketing and sales expenditures or significantly reduce or eliminate the role of sales representatives in the promotion of their products, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Commercial Services revenues depend, in large part, on promotional, marketing and sales expenditures by companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare industries. Promotional, marketing and sales expenditures by pharmaceutical manufacturers have in the past been, and could in the future be, negatively impacted by, among other things, governmental reform or private market initiatives intended to reduce the cost of pharmaceutical products or by governmental, medical association or pharmaceutical industry initiatives designed to regulate the manner in which pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their products as well as the high level of patent expiration and related introduction of generic versions of branded medicine within the industry. Furthermore, the trend in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare industries toward consolidation may result in a reduction in overall sales and marketing expenditures and, potentially, a reduction in the use of outsourced sales and marketing services providers. This reduction in demand for outsourced sales and marketing services could be further exacerbated by the current economic condition of the United States and foreign countries. If companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology or healthcare industries significantly reduce their promotional, marketing and sales expenditures or significantly reduce or eliminate the role of sales representatives in the promotion of their products, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our Commercial Services customers continue to experience increased competition from manufacturers of generic drugs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur Commercial Services revenues depend on promotional, marketing and sales expenditures by companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare industries. Promotional, marketing and sales expenditures by pharmaceutical manufacturers have in the past been, and could in the future be, negatively impacted by the introduction of generic versions of branded medicines. This generic competition may occur upon the expiration or loss of patent protection, or in certain circumstances, upon the \u201cat-risk\u201d launch by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of a product we are promoting. The timing or impact of generic competition cannot be accurately predicted by us or our customers and could cause our customers to introduce cost cutting initiatives that result in reduced demand for our outsourced promotional services, or lead to the early termination of existing contracts, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe industries in which our Commercial Services segment operates in is highly competitive and our failure to address competitive developments may reduce our market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur primary competitors for sales and marketing services include in-house sales and marketing departments of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare companies, other contract sales organizations (CSOs) and providers of marketing and related services. Most of our current and potential competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater capital, personnel and other resources than we have and certain of our competitors currently offer a broader range of personal and non-personal promotional and other related promotional services than we do. Additionally, certain of our competitors provide services on a global basis at the request of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare customers. Our inability to continue to remain competitive with respect to the range of service offerings that we can provide companies within the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare industries on a global basis or any other factors that result in increased competition may reduce our market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and result of results of operations.\nEnacted healthcare reform legislation may increase our costs, impair our ability to adjust our pricing to match with any such increased costs, and therefore could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPPACA entails sweeping healthcare reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2018, although certain of these effective dates have been delayed by action of the current administration. While some guidance has been issued under PPACA over the past several years, many provisions in PPACA require the issuance of additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, and State governments. This reform includes, but is not limited to: the implementation of a small business tax credit; required changes in the design of our healthcare policy including. providing insurance coverage to part-time workers working on average thirty (30) or more hours per week; \u201cgrandfathering\u201d provisions for existing policies; \u201cpay or play\u201d requirements; and a \u201cCadillac plan\u201d excise tax.\nEffective January 1, 2014, each State was required to participate in the PPACA marketplace and make health insurance coverage available for purchase by eligible individuals through a website. While these websites were subject to significant administrative\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nissues leading up to their inception dates (and, in some cases, thereafter), it is currently estimated that in excess of three million individuals nationwide have sought health insurance coverage through these exchanges. It is unclear, however, how many of these individuals actually attained health insurance coverage or whether such individuals are becoming insured after previously not having health insurance coverage.\nPPACA also requires \"Applicable Manufacturers\" to disclose to the Secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services drug sample distributions and certain payments or transfers of value to covered recipients (physicians and teaching hospitals) on an annual basis. \"Applicable Manufacturers\" and \"Applicable Group Purchasing Organizations\" must also disclose certain physician ownership or investment interests. The data submitted will ultimately be made available on a public website. Based upon the structure of its relationship with its clients, PDI may be defined as an \"Applicable Manufacturer\" for purposes of the disclosure requirements or may provide services that include the transfer of drug samples and/or other items of value to covered recipients. As such, we may be required to disclose or provide information that is subject to disclosure. There may be certain risks and penalties associated with the failure to properly make such disclosures, including but not limited to the specific civil liabilities set forth in PPACA, which allows for a maximum civil monetary penalty per \"Applicable Manufacturer\" of $1,150,000. There may be additional risks and claims made by third parties derived from an improper disclosure that are difficult to ascertain at this time.\nIn June 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of key provisions of PPACA. PPACA contains numerous other initiatives that impact the pharmaceutical industry. These include, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing existing price rebates in Federally funded health care programs;\n\u2022\nexpanding rebates, or other pharmaceutical company discounts, into new programs;\n\u2022\nimposing a new non-deductible excise tax on sales of certain prescription pharmaceutical products by prescription drug manufacturers and importers;\n\u2022\nreducing incentives for employer-sponsored health care;\n\u2022\ncreating an independent commission to propose changes to Medicare with a particular focus on the cost of biopharmaceuticals in Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nproviding a government-run public option with biopharmaceutical price-setting capabilities;\n\u2022\nallowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices within Medicare Part D directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers;\n\u2022\nreducing the number of years of data exclusivity for innovative biological products potentially leading to earlier biosimilar competition; and\n\u2022\nincreasing oversight by the FDA of pharmaceutical research and development processes and commercialization tactics.\nWhile PPACA may increase the number of patients who have insurance coverage for the products we promote, its cost containment measures could also adversely affect reimbursement for any of our customers\u2019 products. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that our customers receive for any products they may develop in the future. If our customers\u2019 products are not considered cost-effective or if they are unable to generate adequate third-party reimbursement for the users of their products, then our customers may be unable to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment for their products. Our customers could impose margin pressures on us in an effort to recoup a portion of their return on investment, which would have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are currently unable to determine the long-term, direct or indirect impact of such legislation on our business. Since the effect of many of the provisions of PPACA may not be determinable for a number of years, we do not expect PPACA to have a material adverse impact on our near term results of operations. However, healthcare reform as mandated and implemented under PPACA and any future federal or state mandated healthcare reform could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our costs, hindering our ability to effectively match our cost of providing health insurance with our pricing and impeding our ability to attract and retain customers as well as potentially changing our business model or causing us to lose certain current competitive advantages.\nChanges in governmental regulation could negatively impact our business operations and increase our costs.\nThe pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare industries are subject to a high degree of governmental regulation. Significant changes in these regulations affecting the services we provide, including product promotional, marketing research services and physician interaction programs, could result in the imposition of additional restrictions on these types of activities, additional costs to us in providing these services to our customers or otherwise negatively impact our business operations. Changes in governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our customers' products could also reduce, eliminate or otherwise negatively impact our customers' utilization of our sales and marketing services.\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nOur failure, or that of our customers, to comply with applicable healthcare regulations could limit, prohibit or otherwise adversely impact our business activities and could result in substantial penalties.\nVarious laws, regulations and guidelines established by government, industry and professional bodies affect, among other matters, the provision, licensing, labeling, marketing, promotion, sale and distribution of healthcare services and products, including pharmaceutical products. The healthcare industry also is regulated by various Federal and State laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on the payment or acceptance of kickbacks or other remuneration in return for the purchase or lease of products that are paid for by Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of these regulations may incur investigation or enforcement action by the FDA, Department of Justice, State agencies, or other legal authorities, and may result in substantial civil, criminal, or other sanctions. Sanctions for violating the fraud and abuse laws also may include possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal or State healthcare programs. Although we believe our current business arrangements do not violate these laws, we cannot assure you that our business practices will not be challenged under these laws in the future or that a challenge would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, even if we successfully defend against such claims. While we rely on contractual indemnification provisions with our commercial customers to protect us against certain claims, we cannot provide assurance that these provisions will be fully enforceable or that they will provide adequate protection against the claims intended to be covered.\nGENERAL RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe majority of our revenue is currently derived from a very limited number of customers, the loss of any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue and profitability depend to a great extent on our relationships with a very limited number of large pharmaceutical companies. As of December 31, 2014, our two largest customers accounted for approximately 69.7% of our 2014 revenue. As of December 31, 2013, our four largest customers accounted for approximately 67.4% of our 2013 revenue. While we expect to continue gaining new business in 2015, it is likely that our revenue and profitability will continue to be dependent on significant contracts with a very limited number of large pharmaceutical companies, and we may experience an even higher degree of customer concentration in 2015 and beyond in light of continued consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry and current business development opportunities.\nIn order to continue increasing our revenues, we will need to maintain and grow business with our existing customers while attracting additional significant customers. Our failure to attract a sufficient number of new customers during a particular period, or our inability to replace the loss of or significant reduction in business from a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not increase our revenues and successfully manage the size of our operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe majority of our operating expenses are personnel-related costs such as employee compensation and benefits as well as the cost of infrastructure to support our operations, including facility space and equipment. We continuously review our personnel to determine whether we are fully utilizing their services. If we believe we are not in a position to fully utilize our personnel, we may make reductions to our workforce. If we are unable to achieve revenue growth in the future or fail to adjust our cost infrastructure to the appropriate level to support our revenues, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur inability to finance our business on acceptable terms in the future may limit our ability to develop and commercialize new molecular diagnostic solutions and technologies and grow our business.\nWe expect capital expenditures and operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure and commercial operations. We may seek to raise finance our business through collaborations, equity offerings, debt financings, or licensing arrangements. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more molecular diagnostic tests or selling and marketing initiatives and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nOur debt obligations include covenants restricting our business, which may adversely affect us.\nOn October 31, 2014, in connection with our acquisition of RedPath, we entered into a credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with certain lenders. The Credit Agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, including a minimum liquidity requirement and minimum revenue targets, and includes limitations on, among other things, additional indebtedness, paying dividends in certain circumstances, acquisitions and certain investments. In addition, on October 31, 2014, we issued an interest-free note to the representative of the equityholders of RedPath, or the Note, at the closing of our acquisition of RedPath for $11.0 million to be paid in eight equal consecutive quarterly installments beginning October 1, 2016. The Note provides that the violation of any term, covenant or condition of the Credit Agreement and other ancillary security agreements is also a breach of the Note. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the Credit Agreement and the Note may result in an event of default under such agreements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not have enough cash available to service our debt. Our debt includes certain restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations and capital needs or pursue business opportunities and activities.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on the Term Notes and our other indebtedness, or to refinance our debt, depends on our future operating and financial performance, which will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, technical and other factors beyond our control. If in the future we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we, among other things, may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or sell material assets. If we are not able to refinance our debt as necessary, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt. Despite being leveraged, we may be able to incur more debt in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks of our leverage. We may need to incur additional debt in the future to complete acquisitions or capital projects or for working capital. In certain circumstances, we may need to incur substantial additional debt. We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. These restrictions may limit our ability to operate our businesses and may prohibit or limit our activity to enhance our operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. If we breach any of our debt covenants we may be in default under terms of our debt. A significant portion or all of our indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable. We may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.\nIn addition, some of our contracts include exclusivity provisions limiting our ability to promote or represent competing products during the contract service period unless consent has been provided by the customer, and may also require the personnel we utilize to be dedicated exclusively to promoting or representing a single customer\u2019s product for the term of the contract. Accordingly, these types of arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur profitability will be impaired by our obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to Asuragen and the equityholders of RedPath.\nIn connection with our acquisition of RedPath and certain assets of Asuragen in 2014, we are obligated to make certain royalty and milestone payments. With respect to our acquisition of certain assets of Asuragen, we are obligated to make a milestone payment of $0.5 million to Asuragen upon the earlier of the launch of PancraMir\u2122 and February 13, 2016, and to pay royalties of 5% on the future net sales of the miRInform\u2122 pancreas platform for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale, 3.5% on the future net sales of the miRInform\u2122 thyroid platform through August 13, 2024 and 1.5% on the future net sales of certain other thyroid diagnostics tests for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale. With respect to our acquisition of RedPath, we entered into a contingent consideration agreement with the representative of the equityholders of RedPath, or the Contingent Consideration Agreement. Pursuant to the Contingent Consideration Agreement, we agreed to issue to the equityholders of RedPath 500,000 shares of our common stock upon acceptance for publication of a specified article related to PathFinderTG\u00ae for the management of Barrett\u2019s esophagus, and an additional 500,000 shares of our common stock upon the commercial launch of PathFinderTG\u00ae for the management of Barrett\u2019s esophagus, or collectively, the Common Stock Milestones. In the event of a change of control of PDI, Interpace Diagnostics, LLC or Interpace Diagnostics Corporation on or before April 30, 2016, the Common Stock Milestones not then already achieved will be accelerated and the equityholders of RedPath will be immediately entitled to receive the Common Stock not yet previously issued to them. The equityholders of RedPath are entitled to an additional $5 million cash payment upon the achievement by us of $14.0 million or more in annual net sales of PathFinderTG\u00ae for the management of Barrett\u2019s esophagus and a further $5 million cash payment upon the achievement by us of $37.0 million or more in annual net sales of a basket of assays of Interpace Diagnostics, LLC and Interpace Diagnostics Corporation. In addition, we are obligated to pay revenue based payments through 2025 of 6.5% on annual net sales above $12.0 million of PancraGen\u2122, 10% on annual net sales up to $30 million of PathFinderTG\u00ae for the management of Barrett\u2019s esophagus and 20% on annual net sales above $30 million of PathFinderTG\u00ae for the management of Barrett\u2019s esophagus.\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nEven if we are able to successfully launch the above referenced diagnostic tests, our profitability will be impaired by our obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to Asuragen and the equityholders of RedPath. Although we believe, under such circumstances, that the increase in revenue will exceed the corresponding royalty and milestone payments, our obligations to Asuragen and the equityholders of RedPath could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to manage our operating costs and expenses at profitable levels.\nOur business may suffer if we fail to attract and retain qualified sales representatives.\nThe success and growth of our Commercial Services and Diagnostics businesses depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain qualified sales representatives. There is competition for sales representatives from contract services organizations and pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare companies. In addition, in certain instances, we offer our Commercial Services customers the option to permanently hire our sales representatives, and on occasion, our Commercial Services customers have hired the sales representatives that we trained to detail their products. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. If we cannot attract and retain qualified sales personnel our Commercial Services and Diagnostics businesses will suffer, and our ability to perform under our existing sales force contracts and sell our molecular diagnostics tests may be impaired.\nThe loss of members of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our Commercial Services and Diagnostics businesses.\nThe success of our business depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our executive management team and others in key management positions. The efforts of these persons will be critical to us as we continue to grow our Commercial Services business and develop and/or acquire additional molecular diagnostic tests. If we were to lose one or more of these key employees, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategy. In addition, our commercial laboratory operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, including licensed clinical laboratory scientists. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the competition for qualified personnel. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to support our clinical laboratory and commercialization.\nWe may acquire businesses or assets or make investments in other companies or molecular diagnostic technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of synergistic businesses or molecular diagnostic assets. If we make any further acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisition by us also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Integration of an acquired company or business will also likely require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. To finance any acquisitions or investments, we may choose to issue shares of our stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies for stock. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for these activities through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If these funds are raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Consummating an acquisition poses a number of risks including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to accurately estimate the financial impact of an acquisition on our overall business;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may require us to incur debt or other obligations, incur large and immediate write-offs, issue capital stock potentially dilutive to our stockholders or spend significant cash, or may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nif we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline;\n\u2022\nworse than expected performance of an acquired business may result in the impairment of intangible assets;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from acquisitions as a result of inherent risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired businesses or retaining key personnel, partners, customers or other key relationships, and risks that acquired entities may not operate profitably or that acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers;\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\n\u2022\nour customers may not accept new molecular diagnostic tests from our acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts of our acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to combine product offerings and product lines of our acquired businesses timely and efficiently;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, including as a result of pending and future shareholder lawsuits relating to acquisitions or exercise by stockholders of their statutory appraisal rights, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may involve significant contingent payments that may adversely affect our future liquidity or capital resources;\n\u2022\naccounting for contingent payments requires significant judgment and changes to the assumptions used in determining the fair value of our contingent payments could lead to significant volatility in earnings;\n\u2022\nacquisitions and subsequent integration of these companies may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of an unsuccessful acquisition may adversely affect our financial performance.\nAdditional risks of integration of an acquired business include:\n\u2022\ndiffering information technology, internal control, financial reporting and record-keeping systems;\n\u2022\ndifferences in accounting policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nunanticipated additional transaction and integration-related costs;\n\u2022\nfacilities or operations of acquired businesses in remote locations and the inherent risks of operating in unfamiliar legal and regulatory environments; and\n\u2022\nnew products, including the risk that any underlying intellectual property associated with such products may not have been adequately protected or that such products may infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nIf our information technology and communications systems fail or we experience a significant interruption in their operation, our reputation, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology and communications systems. The failure of these systems to operate as anticipated could disrupt our business and result in decreased revenue and increased overhead costs. In addition, we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Our information technology and communications systems, including the information technology systems and services that are maintained by third party vendors, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, fire, terrorist attacks, malicious attacks by computer viruses or hackers, power loss or failure of computer systems, Internet, telecommunications or data networks. If these systems or services become unavailable or suffer a security breach, we may expend significant resources to address these problems, and our reputation, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have and may continue to experience goodwill impairment charges.\nWe are required to evaluate goodwill at least annually, and between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant such a test. These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our segments. Goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units to which the value of the goodwill relates. We currently have three reporting units, with one reporting unit in our Interpace Diagnostics segment having goodwill. If we determine that the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss will be recorded in our statement of comprehensive income (loss). The determination of fair value is a highly subjective exercise and can produce significantly different results based on the assumptions used and methodologies employed. If our projected long-term sales growth rate, profit margins or terminal growth rate are considerably lower and/or the assumed weighted-average cost of capital is considerably higher, future testing may indicate impairment and we would have to record a non-cash impairment loss in our statement of comprehensive income (loss). See Note 7, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur largest stockholder continues to have significant influence, which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nJohn P. Dugan, our former chairman, beneficially owns approximately 32% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Dugan is able to exercise significant influence over the election of all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including a merger with or into another company, the sale of all or substantially\nPDI, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nall of our assets and amendments to our certificate of incorporation. This ownership concentration by Mr. Dugan could delay or prevent a change in corporate control that may otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders.\nWe have anti-takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions, such as providing for three classes of directors, which may make it more difficult to remove our directors and management and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which allows our board of directors to create one or more classes of preferred stock with rights and preferences greater than those afforded to the holders of our common stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a future takeover or a change in control, unless the takeover or change in control is approved by our board of directors. We are also subject to laws that may have a similar effect. For example, section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. As a result of the foregoing, it will be difficult for another company to acquire us and, therefore, could limit the price that possible investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, the rights of our common stockholders will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future.\nOur quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may vary, which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may vary as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe commencement, delay, cancellation or completion of sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments;\n\u2022\nuncertainty about when, if at all, revenue from any product commercialization arrangements and/or other incentive-based arrangements with our customers, as well as from sales of our molecular diagnostic tests, will be recognized;\n\u2022\nmix of services provided and/or mix of programs during the period;\n\u2022\ntiming and amount of expenses for implementing new programs and accuracy of estimates of resources required for ongoing programs;\n\u2022\ntiming and integration of any acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulations related to diagnostics, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare companies.\nIn addition, in the case of revenue related to service contracts, we recognize revenue as services are performed, while program costs, other than training costs, are expensed as incurred. We believe that quarterly, and in certain instances annual, comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Fluctuations in quarterly and annual results could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long-term operating performance.\nOur stock price is volatile and could be further affected by events not within our control, and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThe market for our common stock is volatile. During 2014, our stock traded at a low of $1.34 and a high of $6.25. In 2013, our stock traded at a low of $3.82 and a high of $8.25. The trading price of our common stock has been and will continue to be subject to:\n\u2022\ngeneral volatility in the trading markets;\n\u2022\nsignificant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in our cash and cash equivalent reserves;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding our business or the business of our competitors;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nindustry and/or regulatory developments;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue mix;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue and revenue growth rates for us and for the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; and\n\u2022\nstatements or changes in opinions, ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we operate or expect to operate.\nPDI, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(tabular information in thousands, except share and per share data)", "PERMNO": 86083, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "IDXG"}
