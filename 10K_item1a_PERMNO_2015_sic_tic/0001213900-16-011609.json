Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Business and Financial Condition\nBecause we have historically experienced losses, if we are unable to achieve profitability, our financial condition and company could suffer.\nSince the inception of our business we have historically incurred losses. While we have increased revenues significantly, we have not yet been able to achieve profitability due to significant investments in our growth and non-cash expenses. Our ability to achieve consistent profitability depends on our ability to generate sales through our technology platform and advertising model, while maintaining reasonable expense levels. If we do not achieve sustainable profitability, it may impact our ability to continue our operations.\nOur business and growth may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees.\nOur success depends on the expertise of our executive officers and certain other key technical personnel. It may be difficult to find sufficiently qualified individuals to replace management or other key technical personnel in the event of death, disability or resignation, thus frustrating our ability to implement our business plan, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nFurthermore, our ability to expand operations to accommodate our anticipated growth will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified media, management, finance, marketing, sales and technical personnel. However, competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals. Our ability to meet our business development objectives will depend in part on our ability to recruit, train and retain top quality people with advanced skills who understand our technology and business. If we are unable to engage and retain the necessary personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to obtain retain or attract additional customers could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan.\nWe currently work with many leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Actavis, AstraZeneca, Alcon, Daiichi Sankyo, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Valeant, Shire, and others. Our failure to retain existing customers or expand with new customers could negatively impact our business.\nWe are dependent on a concentrated group of customers\nOur revenues are concentrated in approximately 25 customers, primarily large pharmaceutical manufacturers and large advertising agencies. Approximately 52% of our revenue came from our largest five customers. Loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.\nWe may be unable to support our technology to further scale our operations successfully.\nOur plan is to grow rapidly through further integration of our technology in electronic platforms. Our growth will place significant demands on our management and technology development, as well as our financial, administrative and other resources. We cannot guarantee that any of the systems, procedures and controls we put in place will be adequate to support the commercialization of our operations. Our operating results will depend substantially on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our financial, administrative and other resources. If we are unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions, or the scale of our products, services and operations, then the quality of our services, our ability to retain key personnel and our business could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain our contracts with electronic prescription platforms, our business will suffer.\nWe are reliant upon our contracts with leading electronic prescribing platforms, including Allscripts, Dr. First, Quest Diagnostics, and others. We will need to maintain these relationships as well as diversify them. The inability to do so could adversely impact our business.\nOur agreements with electronic prescription platforms are subject to audit.\nOur agreements with our electronic prescription platform partners provide for revenue sharing payments to the platform partners based on the revenue we generate through the platform. These payments are subject to audit by our partners, at their cost, and if there is a dispute as to the calculation, we may be liable for additional payments. If an underpayment is determined to be in excess of a certain amount, for example 10%, some agreements would require us to pay for the cost of the audit, as well.\nDeveloping and implementing new and updated applications, features and services for our portals may be more difficult than expected, may take longer and cost more than expected and may not result in sufficient increases in revenue to justify the costs.\nWe have completed the development and migration of SampleMD 2.0\u2019s on-demand, rule based content delivery platform. The system can now manage up to 1 million rules and return the appropriate content within 1 second. This allows unsurpassed response time to avoid delays, and the ability to meet the upcoming dramatic scale we expect. Despite the launch of Sample MD 2.0, attracting and retaining users of our portals requires us to continue to improve the technology underlying those portals and to continue to develop new and updated applications, features and services for those portals. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or if we are unable to implement new applications, features and services without disruption to our existing ones, we may lose potential users and clients. The costs of development of these enhancements may negatively impact our ability to achieve profitability.\nWe rely on a combination of internal development, strategic relationships, licensing and acquisitions to develop our portals and related applications, features and services. Our development and/or implementation of new technologies, applications, features and services may cost more than expected, may take longer than originally expected, may require more testing than originally anticipated and may require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources. There can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from any new or updated technologies, applications, features or services will justify the amounts spent.\nIf we are unable to adhere to the regulatory and competitive climate in which we operate, we could be materially and negatively impacted.\nDo to the labyrinth of regulations in healthcare space, state and federal, as well as political sensitivity of healthcare delivery, our business model could be negatively impacted or fail.\nThe markets in which we operate are competitive, continually evolving and, in some cases, subject to rapid change.\n\u25cf Our portals face competition from numerous other companies, both in attracting users and in generating revenue from advertisers and sponsors. We compete for users with online services and websites that provide savings on medications and healthcare products, including both commercial sites and not-for-profit sites. We compete for advertisers and sponsors with: health-related web sites; general purpose consumer web sites that offer specialized health sub-channels; other high-traffic web sites that include both healthcare-related and non-healthcare-related content and services; search engines that provide specialized health search; and advertising networks that aggregate traffic from multiple sites.\n\u25cf Our healthcare provider portals compete with: providers of healthcare decision-support tools and online health management applications; wellness and disease management vendors; and health information services and health management offerings of healthcare benefits companies and their affiliates.\nMany of our competitors have greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than we do. These organizations may be better known than we are and have more customers or users than we do. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations or any alliances they have formed or may form. Since there are no substantial barriers to entry into the markets in which our public portals participate, we expect that competitors will continue to enter these markets.\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business\nMost of our revenue is derived from the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes affecting healthcare spending. We are particularly dependent on pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies for our advertising and sponsorship revenue.\nGeneral reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things:\n\u25cf government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare providers interact with patients, payers or other healthcare industry participants, including changes in pricing or means of delivery of healthcare products and services;\n\u25cf government regulation prohibiting the use of coupons by patients covered by federally funded health insurance programs;\n\u25cf consolidation of healthcare industry participants;\n\u25cf reductions in governmental funding for healthcare; and\n\u25cf adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payers or providers, pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device companies or other healthcare industry participants.\nEven if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market segments that we serve or are planning to serve. For example, use of our products and services could be affected by:\n\u25cf changes in the design of health insurance plans;\n\u25cf a decrease in the number of new drugs or medical devices coming to market;\n\u25cf a decrease in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical or medical device companies, including as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage or prohibit advertising or sponsorship activities by pharmaceutical or medical device companies; and\n\u25cf payor pressure to move to generic brands.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to products and services of the types we provide.\nThe healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. However, the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the markets for our products and services will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets.\nBecause we are embroiled in various lawsuits from time to time with uncertain consequences, the outcome of potential judgments may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations\nWe are currently involved in litigation and other disputes, as described in Item 3 of this report. As we continue to grow, we can expect to have to deal with lawsuits that affect our business. Lawsuits are uncertain and involve a substantial degree of risk. If we are unable to successfully prosecute or defend these actions, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nOur success is dependent in part on obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our proprietary rights and our ability to avoid infringing on the proprietary rights of others.\nWe seek patent protection for those inventions and technologies for which we believe such protection is suitable and is likely to provide a competitive advantage to us. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. In the event a competitor or other party successfully challenges our products, processes, patents or licenses or claims that we have infringed upon their intellectual property, we could incur substantial litigation costs defending against such claims, be required to pay royalties, license fees or other damages or be barred from using the intellectual property at issue, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also rely substantially on trade secrets, proprietary technology, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements, and technical measures to protect our technology, application, design, and manufacturing know-how, and work actively to foster continuing technological innovation to maintain and protect our competitive position. We cannot assure you that steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property and other contractual agreements for our business will be adequate, that our competitors will not independently develop or patent substantially equivalent or superior technologies or be able to design around patents that we may receive, or that our intellectual property will not be misappropriated.\nOur business will suffer if our network systems fail or become unavailable.\nA reduction in the performance, reliability and availability of our network infrastructure would harm our ability to distribute our products to our users, as well as our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers. Our systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, Internet breakdown, earthquake and similar events. Our systems could also be subject to viruses, break-ins, sabotage, acts of terrorism, acts of vandalism, hacking, cyber-terrorism and similar misconduct. We might not carry adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage. Any system error or failure that causes interruption in availability of our product or an increase in response time could result in a loss of potential customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we suffer sustained or repeated interruptions, then our products and services could be less attractive to our users and our business would be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to manage growth, our operations could be adversely affected.\nOur progress is expected to require the full utilization of our management, financial and other resources. Our ability to manage growth effectively will depend on our ability to improve and expand operations, including our financial and management information systems, and to recruit, train and manage personnel. There can be no absolute assurance that management will be able to manage growth effectively.\nIf we do not properly manage the growth of our business, we may experience significant strains on our management and operations and disruptions in our business. Various risks arise when companies and industries grow quickly. If our business or industry grows too quickly, our ability to meet customer demand in a timely and efficient manner could be challenged. We may also experience development delays as we seek to meet increased demand for our products. Our failure to properly manage the growth that we or our industry might experience could negatively impact our ability to execute on our operating plan and, accordingly, could have an adverse impact on our business, our cash flow and results of operations, and our reputation with our current or potential customers.\nOur business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure\nBecause our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal and state entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities have continued to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Complying with these new regulations has resulted in, and is likely to continue to result in, increased general & administrative costs and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating and other business activities to compliance activities.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nIf a market for our common stock does not develop, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares.\nOur common stock is quoted under the symbol \u201cOPRX\u201d on the OTCQB operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc., an electronic inter-dealer quotation medium for equity securities. We do not currently have an active trading market. There can be no assurance that an active and liquid trading market will develop or, if developed, that it will be sustained.\nOur securities are very thinly traded. Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock without significantly depressing the value of the stock. Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.\nBecause we are subject to the \u201cPenny Stock\u201d rules, the level of trading activity in our stock may be reduced.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define \"penny stock\" to be any listed, trading equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules which may increase the difficulty Purchasers may experience in attempting to liquidate such securities.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will occur only if our stock price appreciates.\nProvisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions.\nMembers of our board of directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its shareholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of care by a director or officer. Accordingly, you may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition, our Bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if you were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 17895, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "OPRX"}
