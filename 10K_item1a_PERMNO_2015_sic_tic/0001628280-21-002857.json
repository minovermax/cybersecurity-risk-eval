RISK FACTORS\nThe reader should carefully review and consider the risk factors discussed below. Any and all of these risk factors could materially affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, future results of operations or cash flows and possibly lead to a decline in the Company\u2019s stock price. The risks, uncertainties and other factors described below constitute all material risk factors known to management as of the date of this report. These risks factors are not necessarily in the order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that are not currently believed by the Company to be material may also harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCORONAVIRUS (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) PANDEMIC RISKS\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations have been, and are expected to continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a material adverse effect on the level of economic activity around the world, including in all markets served by the Company. In response to this outbreak, the governments of many countries, states, cities, and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations. The Company has implemented numerous measures attempting to manage and mitigate the effects of the virus. While the Company has implemented programs to mitigate the impact of these measures on its results of operations, there can be no assurance that these programs will be successful. The Company cannot predict the degree to, or the time period over which, its sales and operations will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental preventative measures, and the effects could be material. During 2020, the Company's sales declined 8.8% compared to 2019 due in large part to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that we or the Company\u2019s affiliates, employees, suppliers, customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, social distancing protocols, temporary shutdowns, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. For example, in early 2020 the Company experienced a temporary reduction of its manufacturing and operating capacity in China as a result of government-mandated actions to control the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, in the first half of 2020, the Company experienced the ramp-down of its automotive manufacturing facilities in the Americas and European regions coinciding with the temporary shutdown of its major automotive customer facilities in these regions. While many of the Company\u2019s other facilities have been designated as essential businesses in jurisdictions in which facility closures have otherwise been mandated, the Company can give no assurance that this will not change in the future or that its businesses will continue to be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.\nIn addition, restrictions on the Company\u2019s access to its manufacturing facilities, support operations and workforce, or similar limitations for its distributors and suppliers, could continue to limit customer demand and/or the Company\u2019s capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company has modified its business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, limited/restricted third-party access to the Company's facilities, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and may take further actions as may be required by government authorities, for the continued health and safety of its employees, or that the Company otherwise determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. Furthermore, the Company has experienced disruptions and operational inefficiencies from COVID-19 related illnesses and workforce shortages, causing higher production and logistic costs, and may continue to experience such disruptions and operational inefficiencies in the future. The Company may experience delays in its supply chain, which is likely to result in higher supply chain costs to the Company in order to maintain the supply of materials and components for its products.\nManaging the impact of COVID-19 on the Company has and will continue to require significant investment of time from management and employees, as well as resources across the Company's global enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s business may cause it to divert or delay the application of its resources toward other or new initiatives or investments, which may cause a material adverse impact on its results of operations.\nThe Company has and may also continue to experience impacts from market downturns and changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears and impacts on its workforce as a result of COVID-19. The Company has experienced a significant decline in demand from certain customers as a result of COVID-19. In addition, the Company\u2019s customers may choose to delay or abandon projects for which the Company provides products and/or services in response to the adverse impact of COVID-19 and the measures to contain its spread have had on the global economy.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more pronounced in the markets in which the Company or its automotive industry customers operate, or there is a resurgence in the virus in markets currently recovering from the spread of COVID-19, then its operations in areas impacted by such events could experience further materially adverse financial impacts due to market changes and other resulting events and circumstances.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the Company\u2019s financial condition depends on future developments that are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity, the longevity and the impact of COVID-19 on economic activity. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affects the Company\u2019s business and financial results, it may also have the effect of significantly heightening many of the other risks associated with the Company's business and indebtedness. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview of Business\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur invocation due to the COVID-19 pandemic of the force majeure provisions contained in certain contracts may expose us to claims from customers and lead to reputational damage.\nIn the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, labor shortages and operational inefficiencies directly related to COVID-19 affecting the Thermal Acoustical Solutions segment caused the Company to invoke force majeure (or excusable delay) with its customers. The events leading up to the invocation of force majeure caused interruption of a customer\u2019s production line. A resurgence of cases in late 2020 at that same facility caused the Company to expand its declaration of force majeure (or excusable delay) to cover most of its automotive customers. Although the Company believes it has a strong legal basis for asserting force majeure or commercial impracticability as a result of COVID-19, it is reasonably possible customers may assert claims against the Company, and the Company could be subject to financial damages to customers, which could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations and cash flows or its reputation.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presents significant challenges to the Company\u2019s liquidity and ability to comply with its financial covenants.\nThe Company\u2019s continued access to affordable sources of liquidity and its ability to comply with its financial covenants set forth in the 2018 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (\u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d), depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effects on its customers and their production rates, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, its operating performance, and its credit worthiness. The Company relies on the credit markets to provide it with liquidity to operate and grow its businesses beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide. In March 2020, the Company drew down an incremental $20.0 million under its Amended Credit Agreement to provide liquidity as it addressed critical issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, on May 11, 2020, the Company amended its Amended Credit Agreement, which, among other changes, decreased available borrowings from $450.0 million to $314.0 million and modified certain financial covenants, at least one of which the Company expected to fail under the Amended Credit Agreement during the second quarter of 2020. On October 14, 2020, the Company further amended its Amended Credit Agreement to allow certain restructuring and other charges, as defined by the agreement, to be excluded from EBITDA in the calculation of the Company\u2019s financial covenants. As a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, its prospects and its credit ratings. The Company believes that its liquidity resources, including available funds under the Amended Credit Agreement, are sufficient to meet its working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants as of December 31, 2020, and management does not anticipate noncompliance in the foreseeable future. See Note 7, \u201cLong-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements\u201d, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company may not be able to collect amounts owed to it or sell its inventory due to customers becoming significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company experienced an increase in uncollectible receivables during 2020, which may continue if customers continue to be significantly impacted by COVID-19 and are unable to pay. Additionally, the Company may experience an increase in inventory write-off charges for those inventory items that have no alternative use for customers that are severely impacted by COVID-19.\nGLOBAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS\nGlobal political or economic changes may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nOngoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and impact profitability. Among other factors, political conflicts or changes, disruptions in the global credit and financial markets, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, swings in consumer confidence and spending, unstable economic growth and fluctuations in unemployment rates causing economic instability could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These factors also make it difficult to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.\nFurthermore, the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the U.S. or by countries where the Company sells products or procures materials incorporated into our products could negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, a government's adoption of \"buy national\" policies or retaliation by another government against such policies, could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations by decreasing the demand for Company products in certain countries and/or increase the prices on raw materials that are critical to the Company's businesses.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union (\"EU\") (generally referred to as \u201cBREXIT\u201d). On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and EU reached an agreement (\"Brexit Agreement\") which contains new rules for how the U.K. and EU will live, work, and trade together. The Company has operations in the U.K. Changes resulting from Brexit and the Brexit Agreement could subject the Company to increased risk, including among other things, regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes, or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the E.U., extra charges, and/or difficulty with hiring employees. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the Brexit Agreement.\nBrexit may also cause fluctuations in the value of the U.K. pound sterling and E.U. euro. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect the Company's expenses, earnings, cash flows, results of operations, and revenues. Although the Company may attempt to mitigate some of its exposure to foreign currency exchange risks through hedging arrangements, the Company's hedging arrangements may not target the potential impacts associated with fluctuations in currency resulting from Brexit or otherwise effectively offset the adverse financial impacts.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign sales, including U.S. and non-U.S. customers, and U.S. export sales were 55.3% of net sales in 2020, 53.1% in 2019, and 53.5% in 2018. If the global economy were to take a significant downturn, depending on the length, duration and severity of such downturn, the Company\u2019s business and financial statements could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign operations expose it to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks.\nThe Company believes that in order to be competitive and grow its businesses, it needs to maintain significant foreign operations. Foreign sales were $343.9 million, $358.7 million and $363.7 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Foreign operations are subject to inherent risks including political and economic conditions in various countries, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements (including tariff regulations and trade restrictions), longer accounts receivable collection cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in travel restrictions and extended temporary shutdowns of certain businesses outside the U.S. The Company has little control over most of these risks and may be unable to\nanticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, unable to alter its business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations and limitations on repatriation of earnings may affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s financial results are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increased proportion of its assets, liabilities and expenses are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. There can be significant volatility in foreign currencies that impact the Company, primarily the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Chinese Yuan, and Canadian Dollar. The Company\u2019s foreign and domestic operations seek to limit foreign currency exchange transaction risk by completing transactions in functional currencies whenever practical or through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts when deemed appropriate. If the Company does not successfully hedge its currency exposure, changes in the rate of exchange between these currencies and the U.S. dollar may negatively impact the Company. Translation of the results of operations and financial condition of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, limitations on the repatriation of earnings, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances, may limit or negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to redeploy or distribute cash. The Company receives a material portion of its revenue from foreign operations. Foreign operations generated approximately 45.0%, 42.8% and 46.3% of total net sales for fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nCOMPANY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe Company\u2019s Thermal Acoustical Solutions segment, and to a lesser extent, Technical Nonwovens and Performance Materials segments, are tied primarily to general economic and automotive industry conditions.\nConsolidated sales to the automotive market accounted for 38.5%, 42.9% and 46.3% of the Company\u2019s net sales for fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Thermal Acoustical Solutions segment net sales from products manufactured in North America were 68.3%, 69.9%, and 69.6% for fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, with the remainder manufactured in Europe and Asia. This segment is closely tied to general economic and automotive industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit, the cost of fuel, legislative and regulatory oversight and trade agreements. These factors have had, and could continue to have, a substantial impact on the segment. Adverse developments could reduce demand for new vehicles, causing the Company\u2019s customers to reduce their vehicle production in North America, Europe and Asia and, as a result, demand for Company products would be adversely affected.\nImplementation of the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives may not be successful.\nAs part of its business strategy, the Company continues to review various strategic and business opportunities to grow the business and to assess the profitability and growth potential for each of its existing businesses. The Company may incur significant professional services expenses associated with the review and potential implementation of strategic business opportunities. The Company cannot predict with certainty whether any recent or future strategic transactions will be beneficial to the Company. Among other things, future performance could be impacted by the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022Identify and effectively complete strategic transactions;\n\u2022Obtain adequate financing to fund strategic initiatives;\n\u2022Successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses that involve numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, managing assets in multiple geographic regions and potential loss of key employees and key customers of acquired operations;\n\u2022Improve operating margins through its Lean Six Sigma initiatives which are intended to improve processes and workflow, improve customer service, reduce costs and leverage synergies across the Company; and\n\u2022Successfully invest and deploy capital investments to support our business and commitments to our customers.\nIn order to meet its strategic objectives, the Company may also divest assets and/or businesses. Successfully executing such a strategy depends on various factors, including effectively transferring assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities, and employees to any purchaser, identifying and separating the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that the Company wishes to retain, reducing or eliminating fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collecting the proceeds from any divestitures.\nThe Company may be unable to realize expected benefits from cost reduction, restructuring and consolidation efforts; and profitability, specifically, or our business, generally, may otherwise be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, the Company announces restructuring or consolidation plans, which include workforce reductions, facility consolidations and/or closures, and other cost reduction initiatives in order to operate more efficiently and control costs. These plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct cost and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings. The Company may undertake workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. These types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. If the Company does not successfully manage current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that it may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unforeseen delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm the business, which could have a material adverse effect on competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends upon its ability to continue to innovate, improve its existing products, develop and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.\nImproved performance and growth are partially dependent on future improvements to existing products and new product introductions. Delays in improving or developing products and long customer qualification cycles may impact the success of new product programs. The degree of success of new product programs could impact the Company\u2019s future results. Developments by other companies of new, improved, or disruptive products, processes or technologies may make the Company's products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact the Company's net sales. As such, the ability to compete is, in part, dependent on the Company's ability to continually offer enhanced and improved products that meet the changing requirements of the Company's customers. If the Company fails to develop new products or enhance existing products, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRaw material pricing, supply issues, and disruptions in transportation networks could affect all of the Company\u2019s businesses.\nThe Thermal Acoustical Solutions segment uses aluminum and other metals to manufacture most of its automotive heat shields. The Thermal Acoustical Solutions, Technical Nonwovens and Performance Materials segments use various petroleum-derivative fibers in manufacturing products, and the Performance Materials segment uses various glass-derivative fibers in manufacturing products. If the prices and duties of these raw materials, or any other raw materials used in the Company\u2019s businesses increase, the Company may not have the ability to pass all of the incremental cost increases on to its customers. In addition, an interruption in the ability of the Company to source such materials, including government trade restrictions, could negatively impact operations and sales.\nThe Company could be subject to work stoppages or other business interruptions as a result of its unionized work force.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s hourly employees are represented by various union locals and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements contain various expiration dates and must be renegotiated upon expiration. If the Company is unable to negotiate any of its collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms prior to expiration, the Company could experience disruptions in its operations which could have a material adverse effect on operations.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing processes are subject to inherent risk.\nThe Company operates a number of manufacturing facilities and relies upon an effective workforce and properly performing machinery and equipment. The workforce may experience a relatively high turnover rate, causing inefficiencies associated with retraining and rehiring. The equipment and systems necessary for such operations may break down, perform poorly or fail, and possibly cause higher manufacturing and delivery costs. Manufacturing processes affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis, and delays in delivering products to customers could result in the Company incurring increased freight costs and penalties from customers.\nThe Company\u2019s resources are limited and may impair its ability to capitalize on changes in technology, competition and pricing.\nThe industries in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive and many of our competitors are affiliated with entities that are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, and marketing resources. The Company\u2019s more limited resources and relatively diverse product mix may limit or impair its ability to capitalize on changes in technology, competition, or pricing.\nThe Company\u2019s products may fail to perform as expected, subjecting it to warranty or other claims from its customers.\nIf failure of the Company's products results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, the Company may be subject to product liability lawsuits, product recalls and other claims, any of which could have a material adverse impact on results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Company does not retain its key employees, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business strategy could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s success, in part, depends on key managerial, engineering, sales, marketing, and technical personnel and its ability to continue to attract and retain additional personnel. The loss of certain key personnel could have a material, adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. There is no assurance that the Company can retain its key employees or that it can attract competent and effective new or replacement personnel in the future.\nThe Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property, which may limit its ability to compete effectively.\nThe Company owns intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, which play an important role in helping the Company to maintain its competitive position in a number of markets. The Company is subject to risks with respect to (i) changes in the intellectual property landscape of markets in which it competes; (ii) the potential assertion of intellectual property-related claims against the Company; (iii) the misappropriation by third parties of our intellectual property (e.g., disclosure of trade secrets by former employees); (iv) the failure to maximize or successfully assert its intellectual property rights; and (iv) significant technological developments by others.\nImpairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill or other long-lived assets has required, and may in the future require, recording significant charges to earnings.\nThe Company reviews its finite long-lived assets for impairment at the asset group level at least annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a decline in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization, a reduction in future cash flow estimates, and slower future growth rates. Certain factors led to an impairment of the Performance Materials segment goodwill and other long-lived assets amounting to total charges of $61.1 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 and $64.2 million in fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 6, \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nREGULATORY, COMPLIANCE, LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS\nThe Company is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which impose restrictions on the Company and violations of which may carry substantial fines and penalties and result in criminal sanctions.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including anti-bribery legislation in the U.K., generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. The Company\u2019s policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, violations of which often carry substantial fines and penalties and could result in criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers, or its employees. The Company cannot assure that its internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company\u2019s affiliates, employees, or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or financial condition and could possibly lead to a decline in the Company's stock price.\nThe Company is subject to legal and compliance risks and oversight on a global basis and developments in these risks and related matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations that govern our business both in the United States and internationally, including antitrust laws. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in significant fines, penalties or other damages being imposed by regulatory authorities. Expenses and fines arising out of or related to these investigations and related claims can also be significant. Despite meaningful measures that the Company undertakes to seek to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent the Company's employees or agents from violating the laws and regulations. As a result, the Company could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. Violations of laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on the Company's competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe Company is involved in certain legal proceedings and may become involved in future legal proceedings all of which could give rise to liability.\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings that, from time to time, may be material. These proceedings may include, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, stockholder claims, and employment matters. No assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could increase its expense and affect operating results.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that affect operations. New and changing environmental laws and regulations may impact the products manufactured and sold to customers. In order to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations, the Company must devote significant resources and maintain and administer adequate policies, procedures, and oversight. Should the Company fail to do these things, it could be negatively impacted by lower net sales, fines, legal costs, and clean-up requirements.\nThe Company may incur liabilities under various government statutes for the investigation and cleanup of contaminants previously released into the environment. Although there is no certainty, the Company does not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments the Company may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon the Company's cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. Current and on-going environmental matters are further addressed in Note 17, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDEBT COMPLIANCE AND OTHER FINANCIAL RISKS\nIncurring a substantial amount of indebtedness could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial health and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe Company incurred a substantial amount of debt to fund the purchase price of Interface Performance Materials in August 2018. Incurring this additional debt may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes. In addition, the Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to meet the additional debt obligations. On May 11, 2020, the Company amended its Amended Credit Agreement, which, among other changes, decreased available borrowings from $450.0 million to $314.0 million and modified certain financial covenants, at least one of which the Company expected to fail under the Amended Credit Agreement during the second quarter of 2020. The Amended Credit Agreement was further amended on October 14, 2020 to allow certain restructuring and other charges, as defined by the amendment, to be excluded from EBITDA in the calculation of the Company's financial covenants as the Company anticipated it would have failed to satisfy one of the financial covenants prior to the amendment. For further information, see Note 7, \u201cLong-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements\u201d, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any default under the Amended Credit Agreement would likely result in the acceleration of the repayment obligations to our lenders.\nThe Company may not have adequate cash to fund its operating requirements.\nThe principal source of the Company\u2019s liquidity is operating cash flows. Other significant factors that affect the overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures, investments in businesses, acquisitions, income tax payments, pension funding, outcomes of contingencies, and availability of lines of credit and long-term financing. The Company believes that its liquidity resources, including available funds under the Amended Credit Agreement, are sufficient to meet its working capital needs and other cash requirements, however the Company\u2019s liquidity can be impacted by its ability to:\n\u2022Manage working capital and the level of future profitability. The consolidated cash balance is impacted by the Company's ability to collect accounts receivables balances and capital equipment and inventory investments that may be made in response to changing market conditions; and\n\u2022Satisfy covenants and other obligations under its existing Amended Credit Agreement, which expires in August 2023, and includes a consolidated net leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, which could limit or prohibit the Company\u2019s ability to borrow funds. On May 11, 2020, the Company amended its Amended Credit Agreement, which, among other changes, modified certain financial covenants; and, as early as the second quarter of 2020, the Company expected it would have failed to satisfy at least one of the financial covenants prior to the amendment. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with these amended debt covenants and other obligations in the future could limit the Company\u2019s ability to make acquisitions, incur additional debt, make investments, or consummate asset sales and obtain additional financing from other sources. See Note 7, \u201cLong-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements\u201d, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company's hedging activities could negatively impact results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into derivatives to manage exposure to interest rate and currency movements. If the Company does not execute contracts that effectively mitigate the Company's economic exposure to interest rates and currency rates, elects to not apply hedge accounting, or fails to comply with the complex accounting requirements for hedging transactions, the Company's results of operations and cash flows could be volatile, as well as negatively impacted.\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities.\nFor property risk, workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and general liability, director and officers\u2019 liability and employee health care benefits, the Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance. The Company estimates the liabilities associated with the risks retained by the Company, in part, by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions which, by their nature, are subject to a high degree of variability.\nThe Company\u2019s current reserve levels may not be adequate to cover potential exposures.\nEstimates and assumptions may affect the reserves that the Company has established to cover uncollectible accounts receivable, excess or obsolete inventory, income tax valuation, and fair market value write downs of certain assets and various liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRealization of deferred tax assets is not assured.\nThe Company maintains valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets where realization is not reasonably assured. The Company evaluates the likelihood of the realization of all deferred tax assets and reduces the carrying amount to the extent it believes a portion will not be realized. Changes in these assessments can result in an increase or reduction to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s overall effective tax rate.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CYBERSECURITY, AND DATA PRIVACY RISKS\nDisruptions may occur to the Company\u2019s operations relating to information technology.\nThe capacity, reliability, and security of the Company\u2019s information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) hardware and software infrastructure and the ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to the Company\u2019s changing needs, including an increase in IT support for employees who are encouraged to work remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, are important to the operation of the businesses. Also, any inadequacy, interruption, loss of data, integration failure or security failure of the Company\u2019s IT technology could harm its ability to effectively operate its business, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to the Company\u2019s systems, networks, and data.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose an ongoing risk to the security of the Company\u2019s systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company\u2019s data. While the Company has not, to date, suffered a material loss from cyber incidents, from time to time, the Company experiences attacks on its systems and networks, including attacks that introduce malicious software into the Company's systems and networks, or gain access to and manipulate information in order to perpetrate a fraud on the Company or its customers. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the efforts and controls required to prevent, detect and successfully defend against them. While the Company attempts to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, cyber security monitoring, threat detection and response procedures, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, the Company remains vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. Moreover, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a greater number of employees are working remotely, which further increases the Company's vulnerability to cyber risks. The Company's systems and networks contain sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of the Company\u2019s businesses that is subject to foreign, federal, state and local privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls.\nDespite efforts made by the Company to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, the Company remains vulnerable to security breaches, ransomware, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance and the compromising or loss of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and cash flows. Although the Company carries cybersecurity insurance, in the event of a cyber incident, that insurance may not be extensive enough or adequate in scope of coverage or amount to cover damages the Company may incur. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including loss of information, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which went into effect in the European Union (\"EU\") on May 25, 2018, among other things, mandates new requirements regarding the handling of personal data of employees and customers, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. If the Company fails to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions.\nGENERAL RISKS\nThe Company could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\nOver the last few years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies. The Company could become engaged in a solicitation, or proxy contest, or experience other stockholder activism, in the future. Activist stockholders may advocate for certain governance and strategic changes at the Company. In the event of stockholder activism, particularly with respect to matters which the Company's Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, the Company could be adversely affected because responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management, and perceived uncertainties as to future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results may fluctuate; as a result, the Company may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause the Company\u2019s stock price to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly results are subject to significant fluctuations. Operating results have fluctuated as a result of many factors, including size and timing of orders and shipments, loss of significant customers, product mix, reductions in customer pricing, customer or company shut-downs, technological change, operational efficiencies and inefficiencies, competition, changes in tax laws and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, strategic initiatives, severance and recruiting charges, asset impairment, penalties or fines and general economic conditions. In addition, lower revenues may cause asset utilization to decrease, resulting in the under absorption of the Company\u2019s fixed costs, which could negatively impact gross margins. Additionally, the Company\u2019s gross margins vary among its product groups and have fluctuated from quarter to quarter as a result of shifts in product mix. Any and all of these factors could affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, future results of operations or cash flows and possibly lead to a decline in the Company\u2019s stock price.\nChanges in Accounting Standards could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting and financial reporting policies conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, the Company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB and the SEC. Such new financial accounting standards may change the financial accounting or reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases, which provided for a wide-ranging change to lease accounting. During 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provided for comprehensive changes in revenue recognition and superseded nearly all existing U.S. GAAP. Implementing changes required by new standards, requirements or laws require interpretation of rules and development of new accounting policies and internal controls that if not appropriately applied could result in financial statement errors, deficiencies in internal control in addition to significant costs to implement.\nChanges in tax rates and exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.\nThe Company is subject to risks with respect to changes in tax law and rates, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that are in process or future tax audits in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d). The changes included in the Tax Reform Act were broad and complex and may be subject to further changes as a result of the recent changes in the composition of the U.S. Congress and the new U.S. President. In addition, certain jurisdictions in which the Company operates have statutory rates greater than or less than the United States statutory rate. Changes in the mix and source of earnings between jurisdictions could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s overall effective tax rate.\nIncreases in energy pricing can affect all of the Company\u2019s businesses.\nHigher energy costs at the Company\u2019s manufacturing plants or higher energy costs passed on from the Company\u2019s vendors could impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nIneffective internal controls could impact our business and operating results.\nThe Company's internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of their inherent limitations in detecting human errors, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls; otherwise fails to prevent financial reporting misstatements; or if the Company experiences difficulties in implementing internal controls of acquired businesses, the Company's operating results could be negatively impacted, and the Company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Any statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements are intended to provide management\u2019s current expectations for the future operating and financial performance of the Company based on current assumptions relating to the Company\u2019s business, the economy and future conditions. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified through the use of words such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cexpectations,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201ctargets,\u201d \u201cprospects,\u201d \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201csigns\u201d and other words of similar meaning in connection with the discussion of future operating or financial performance. Forward-looking statements may include, among other things, statements relating to future sales, earnings, cash flow, results of operations, uses of cash and other measures of financial performance.

Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, the risk factors included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 59774, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "LDL"}
