In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201ccontinue\u201d or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements contained in this 10-K involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and situations that may cause our or our industry\u2019s actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These factors include those listed below in this Item 1A and those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We encourage investors to review these factors carefully. We may from time to time make additional written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of us, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nBefore you invest in our securities, you should be aware that our business faces numerous financial and market risks, including those described below, as well as general economic and business risks. The following discussion provides information concerning the material risks and uncertainties that we have identified and believe may adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations. Before you decide whether to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties, together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K and in our other public filings.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Acquisition of Entropic\nIf the acquisition is completed, our actual financial and operating results could differ materially from any expectations or guidance provided by us concerning future results, including (without limitation) expectations or guidance with respect to the financial impact of any cost savings and other potential synergies.\nWe currently expect to realize material cost savings and other synergies as a result of our proposed acquisition of Entropic, and as a result, we currently believe that the acquisition will be accretive to our earnings per share, excluding upfront non-recurring charges, transaction related expenses, and the amortization of purchased intangible assets. The expectations and guidance we have provided with respect to the potential financial impact of the acquisition are subject to numerous assumptions, however, including assumptions derived from our diligence efforts concerning the status of and prospects for Entropic\u2019s business, which we do not currently control, and assumptions relating to the near-term prospects for the semiconductor industry generally and the markets for Entropic\u2019s products in particular. Additional assumptions we have made relate to numerous matters, including (without limitation) the following:\n\u2022\nprojections of Entropic\u2019s future revenues;\n\u2022\nthe anticipated financial performance of Entropic\u2019s products and products currently in development;\n\u2022\nanticipated cost savings and other synergies associated with the acquisition, including potential revenue synergies;\n\u2022\nour expected capital structure after the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe amount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from the acquisition;\n\u2022\ncertain other purchase accounting adjustments that we expect to record in our financial statements in connection with the acquisition;\n\u2022\nacquisition costs, including restructuring charges and transactions costs payable to our financial, legal, and accounting advisors;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain, develop, and deepen relationships with customers of Entropic; and\n\u2022\nother financial and strategic risks of the Entropic acquisition, including the possible impact of reduced liquidity of MaxLinear resulting from deal-related cash outlays.\nWe cannot provide any assurances with respect to the accuracy of our assumptions, including our assumptions with respect to future revenues or revenue growth rates, if any, of Entropic, and we cannot provide assurances with respect to our ability to realize the cost savings that we currently anticipate. Risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from currently anticipated results include, but are not limited to, risks relating to our ability to integrate Entropic successfully; currently unanticipated incremental costs that we may incur in connection with integrating the two companies; risks relating to our ability to realize incremental revenues from the acquisition in the amounts that we currently anticipate; risks relating to the willingness of Entropic\u2019s customers and other partners to continue to conduct business with MaxLinear; and numerous risks and uncertainties that affect the semiconductor industry generally and the markets for our products and those of Entropic specifically. Any failure to integrate Entropic successfully and to realize the financial benefits we currently anticipate from the acquisition would have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition and could materially and adversely affect the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock.\nFailure to integrate our business and operations successfully with those of Entropic in the expected time-frame or otherwise may adversely affect MaxLinear\u2019s operating results and financial condition if the acquisition is completed.\nWe do not have a substantial history of acquiring other companies and have never pursued an acquisition of the size and complexity of Entropic. The success of the proposed acquisition of Entropic will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to integrate Entropic\u2019s business and operations successfully with those of MaxLinear and to realize fully the anticipated benefits and potential synergies from combining our companies, including, among others, currently expected cost savings from\nduplicative functions; potential operational efficiencies in our respective supply chains and in research and development investments; and potential revenue growth resulting from the addition of Entropic\u2019s product portfolio. Historically, we and Entropic have been independent companies, and we will continue to operate as such until the completion of the acquisition. We expect that the integration will be complex and time consuming and will require substantial management time and attention, which may divert attention and resources from other important areas, including our existing businesses. We may face significant challenges in consolidating our operations with Entropic, integrating the two companies\u2019 technologies, and addressing the different corporate cultures of the two companies. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of integrating our respective businesses. If the companies are not successfully integrated, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In such a case, we would expect our operating results and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected, which could also have a material and adverse effect on the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock.\nOur business relationships, including customer relationships, and those of Entropic may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the acquisition.\nIn response to the announcement of the acquisition, customers, vendors, licensors, and other third parties with whom we or Entropic do business or otherwise have relationships may experience uncertainty associated with the acquisition, and this uncertainty could materially affect their decisions with respect to existing or future business relationships with MaxLinear or Entropic while the acquisition is pending or with MaxLinear after the acquisition is completed. Moreover, with respect to Entropic\u2019s prior acquisition of certain television and set-top box assets from Trident Microsystems, Inc. (\u201cTrident\u201d), we were unable to conduct substantial diligence with respect to certain licenses and intellectual property rights because Entropic acquired these assets through Trident\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, we are in many instances unable to evaluate the impact of the acquisition on certain assumed contract rights and obligations, including intellectual property rights.\nThese business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers and others may elect to delay or defer purchase or design-win decisions or switch to other suppliers due to the uncertainty about the direction of our offerings, any perceived unwillingness on our part to support existing Entropic products after the acquisition is completed, or any general perceptions by customers or other third parties that impute operational or business challenges to us arising from the acquisition. In addition, customers or other third parties may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships, which may result in additional obligations imposed on us. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition while the acquisition is pending or after it is completed. The adverse effect of any such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the acquisition for any reason, including delays associated with obtaining regulatory approvals, or termination of the merger agreement. Any loss of customers, customer products, design win opportunities, or other important strategic relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and could have a material and adverse effect on the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock.\nWe and Entropic may have difficulty motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the acquisition.\nUncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on our employees and those of Entropic may have an adverse effect on MaxLinear or Entropic while the acquisition is pending or on MaxLinear after the acquisition is completed. This uncertainty may impair our or Entropic\u2019s ability to retain and motivate key personnel in the months leading up to the completion of the acquisition and our ability to retain and motivate them following the acquisition. Employee retention may be particularly challenging as our and Entropic\u2019s employees may experience frustrations during the integration process and uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the acquisition. For the acquisition to be successful, we and Entropic must continue to retain and motivate executives and other key employees during the period before the acquisition is completed. Furthermore, after the acquisition is completed, MaxLinear must be successful at retaining and motivating key employees in order for the benefits of the transaction to be fully realized. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become employees of MaxLinear after the acquisition is completed, we may incur significant costs in identifying, hiring, and retaining replacements for departing employees, which could substantially reduce or delay our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe merger agreement with Entropic contains provisions that may preclude us, while the transaction is pending, from pursuing acquisitions that we might otherwise pursue or that could discourage or deter bids for MaxLinear and that could require us to pay Entropic an $11.65 million termination fee under certain circumstances.\nUnder the merger agreement, subject to certain exceptions, we are restricted from pursuing or entering into agreements with respect to transactions involving acquisitions of assets or businesses by MaxLinear. In addition, unless and until the\nmerger agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, we are restricted from soliciting, initiating, knowingly encouraging, or knowingly facilitating from or with any person proposals that could reasonably be expected to lead to an \u201cacquisition transaction\u201d (as defined in the merger agreement), including transactions that would result in a change-of-control in or acquisition of MaxLinear. Our board is permitted under certain circumstances to change its recommendation to our stockholders prior to our anticipated special meeting of stockholders if we receive a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d or if an \u201cintervening event\u201d has occurred (in each case, as such terms are defined in the merger agreement). Nevertheless, in such events, we are required to negotiate with Entropic regarding potential amendments to the merger agreement and may only enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal if specified conditions have been satisfied and we have paid Entropic a termination fee of $11.65 million. In addition, we could be required to pay Entropic a termination fee if Entropic terminates the merger agreement due to a \"triggering event,\" which is defined in the definitive merger agreement and includes a change of recommendation by our board to our stockholders or our breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement. These restrictive covenants contained in the merger agreement could have the effect while the acquisition is pending of preventing us from pursuing acquisitions of complementary products or businesses that management believes would be in the best interests of MaxLinear and its stockholders. In addition, these restrictions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring us from considering or proposing an acquisition of MaxLinear. If such a proposal were forthcoming, we may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to such an alternative transaction without incurring potentially significant liability to Entropic.\nIf the proposed acquisition is not completed, we will have incurred substantial costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as well as the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIf the acquisition is not completed, the price of our Class A common stock may decline to the extent that such market price reflects a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed. In addition, we have incurred and will incur substantial costs in connection with the proposed acquisition. These costs are primarily associated with the fees of our financial advisors, accountants, and legal counsel and, with limited exceptions relating to a portion of our financial advisor fees, will be payable regardless of whether the acquisition is completed. In addition, we have diverted significant management resources in an effort to complete the acquisition and are subject to restrictions contained in the merger agreement on the conduct of our business during the pendency of the acquisition. If the acquisition is not completed, we will have received little or no benefit in respect of such costs incurred. If the acquisition is not completed under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, we may be required to pay a termination fee to Entropic of $11.65 million or to reimburse Entropic for its out-of-pocket expenses up to a cap of $2.5 million. Furthermore, if the acquisition is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our suppliers, customers, customer prospects, and employees. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition or on the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur ability to complete the acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including approval of our stockholders and certain required regulatory approvals, which may contain burdensome conditions, including divestitures, that could have an adverse effect on our operation of the business following the acquisition.\nTo complete the acquisition, our stockholders must approve the issuance of the shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. In addition, completion of the acquisition is conditioned upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Even if these approvals are obtained, governmental authorities could impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition, including requiring divestitures that could delay consummation of the acquisition or have an adverse effect on our business following the acquisition. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we have agreed to certain limited divestitures of assets of Entropic, if required by governmental or regulatory authorities, so as to enable the closing of the acquisition as soon as reasonably possible.\nThe special meeting at which our stockholders will vote on the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may take place before all such approvals have been obtained and, in cases where they have not been obtained, before the terms of any conditions to obtain such approvals that may be imposed are known. As a result, if stockholder approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is obtained at our special meeting, we may make decisions after the special meeting to waive a condition or approve certain actions required to obtain necessary approvals without seeking further stockholder approval. Such actions could have an adverse effect on our business following completion of the acquisition. In addition, the merger agreement contains other customary closing conditions, which may not be satisfied or waived.\nIf we are unable to complete the acquisition, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe would not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including, among other things, increased operating efficiencies;\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management may have been diverted to the acquisition rather than to our own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the acquisition as employees and other service providers may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nthe trading price of our Class A common stock may decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed.\nWe can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied, that the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect our business following the acquisition. If we are required to undertake divestitures in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the acquisition, we may be less able to realize anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and our business, operating results, and financial condition after the acquisition may be adversely affected. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the acquisition. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and on the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nIn order to complete the acquisition and distribute the cash consideration payable to Entropic stockholders, we will be required to use substantially all of Entropic\u2019s available cash resources and a sizeable portion of our cash resources. As a result, our available liquidity after the acquisition will be reduced at the same time that the scope of our operations and cash requirements have increased, and we may be required to seek additional financing.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement and in order to implement the distribution of the cash merger consideration to Entropic\u2019s stockholders, Entropic is required to deliver to the exchange agent specified for the acquisition an amount of cash designated by us, which cannot exceed Entropic\u2019s aggregate cash and cash equivalents less $10.0 million. We will be required to fund the balance of the cash merger consideration from our own cash and cash equivalents. Consequently, substantially all of Entropic\u2019s available cash will be used in connection with the acquisition, and our overall liquidity after completion of the acquisition will be materially reduced relative to our current liquidity even though we will have incurred substantial expenses and expect to incur additional restructuring costs as we integrate Entropic\u2019s business and operations. To the extent Entropic\u2019s cash and cash equivalents at closing are less than we currently anticipate, we would be required to use a larger portion of our available cash. As a result of these factors, our board of directors and management may determine to seek financing to enhance our liquidity, which could involve the issuance of debt or equity securities. We cannot provide any assurances that additional financing will be available to us when and as needed or on terms that we believe to be commercially reasonable. To the extent we issue debt securities, such indebtedness would have rights that are senior to holders of equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any equity financing would be dilutive to our current stockholders. If we determine that we require funding as a result of the acquisition but cannot obtain such funding on terms we consider to be reasonable, we may seek other methods to reduce our use of cash, including reductions in our research and development spending, which would be expected to have an adverse long-term effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nA number of purported stockholder class action lawsuits have been filed against us, Entropic, Entropic\u2019s directors, and our merger subsidiaries, Excalibur Acquisition Corporation and Excalibur Subsidiary, LLC, challenging the acquisition, and an unfavorable judgment or ruling in these lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of the acquisition, result in substantial costs, or have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nBeginning on February 9, 2015, a number of purported stockholder class action complaints were filed on behalf of a putative class of Entropic stockholders in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and in the Superior Court of the State of California County of San Diego. The class action complaints name Entropic, the members of Entropic\u2019s board, MaxLinear and our merger subsidiaries, Excalibur Acquisition Corporation and Excalibur Subsidiary, LLC, as defendants. Additional lawsuits may be filed.\nThe class action complaints generally allege, among other things, that, in connection with our proposed acquisition of Entropic, the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties to Entropic stockholders by, among other things, purportedly failing to take steps to maximize the value of Entropic to its stockholders and agreeing to allegedly preclusive deal protection devices in the merger agreement. The complaints further allege that Entropic, MaxLinear, and/or our merger subsidiaries aided and abetted the individual defendants in the alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties. The complaints seek, among other things: an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed transaction; an order declaring the merger agreement unlawful and unenforceable; in the event that the proposed transaction is consummated, an order rescinding it and setting it aside or awarding rescissory damages to the class; imposition of a constructive trust; damages; and/or attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\nOur management believes that the allegations in the Delaware class action complaints and the California class action complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously contest the actions. Litigation is inherently uncertain, however, and there can be no assurances that the defense of these stockholder lawsuits will be successful. In addition, we and Entropic have obligations, under certain circumstances, to hold harmless and indemnify each of the defendant directors against judgments, fines, settlements and expenses related to claims against such directors and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and our and Entropic\u2019s respective bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Such obligations may apply to these lawsuits. An unfavorable outcome in these lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger, result in substantial costs to us and Entropic, or have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf the acquisition of Entropic is completed, the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock to Entropic stockholders will substantially reduce the percentage interests of our stockholders.\nAt the completion of the proposed acquisition of Entropic, we expect to issue approximately 20.6 million shares of our Class A common stock to former Entropic stockholders entitled to receive consideration pursuant to the merger agreement. If the acquisition is completed, we expect that our stockholders will own approximately 65% and that Entropic stockholders will own approximately 35% of our outstanding capital stock following completion of the acquisition. The issuance of shares of our Class A common stock to Entropic stockholders in the acquisition and the assumption by us of Entropic options, restricted stock units, and certain performance stock units will cause a significant reduction in the relative percentage voting and economic interests of our current stockholders.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of MaxLinear and Entropic.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating the operations, technologies, and business systems of MaxLinear and Entropic. We expect business systems integration between the two companies to require substantial management attention, including integration of information management, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll and benefits systems and regulatory compliance functions. Numerous factors beyond our control could affect the total cost or the timing of expected integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, reduce the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses. These integration expenses may result in MaxLinear\u2019s taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the acquisition.\nWe will record goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect our future operating results.\nThe acquisition will be accounted for as an acquisition by MaxLinear in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Entropic will be recorded, as of completion, at their respective fair values and added to our assets and liabilities. Our reported financial condition and results of operations after completion of the acquisition will reflect Entropic\u2019s balances and results but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Entropic for periods prior to the acquisition. As a result, comparisons of future results against prior period results will be more difficult for investors.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated to Entropic\u2019s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill. We expect that the acquisition will result in the creation of goodwill based upon the application of the acquisition method of accounting. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. Any such impairment charge could have a material impact on our operating results in future periods, and the announcement of a material impairment could have an adverse effect on the trading price and trading volume of our Class A common stock.\nThe market value of our Class A common stock could decline if large amounts of our Class A common stock are sold following the acquisition.\nFollowing the acquisition, our stockholders and former stockholders of Entropic will own interests in a company operating an expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities. Our current stockholders (and those of Entropic who will receive our Class A common stock in connection with the acquisition) may not wish to continue to invest in us, or may wish to reduce their investment in us, in order to comply with institutional investing guidelines, to increase diversification or to track any rebalancing of stock indices in which our Class A common stock and Entropic common stock is or was included. If, following the acquisition, large amounts of our Class A common stock are sold, the price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and market share.\nThe global semiconductor market in general, and the RF receiver market in particular, are highly competitive. We compete in different target markets to various degrees on the basis of a number of principal competitive factors, including our products\u2019 performance, features and functionality, energy efficiency, size, ease of system design, customer support, product roadmap, reputation, reliability and price, as well as on the basis of our customer support, the quality of our product roadmap and our reputation. We expect competition to increase and intensify as more and larger semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large, integrated original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, enter our markets. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue, revenue growth rates and operating results.\nAs our products are integrated into a variety of electronic devices, we compete with suppliers of both can tuners and traditional silicon RF receivers, and with providers of physical medium devices for optical interconnect markets. Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets and internal engineering groups within television, set top box, data modems and gateway, satellite low-noise blocker, and optical module manufacturers, some of which may be our customers. Our primary competitors include Silicon Labs, NXP B.V., RDA Microelectronics, Inc., Broadcom Corporation, Entropic Communications, Inc., Rafael Microelectronics, Inc., and Inphi, M/A-COM, Semtech, and Qorvo for our new initiatives into the optical interconnect markets. It is quite likely that competition in the markets in which we participate will increase in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings. In addition, it is quite likely that a number of other public and private companies are in the process of developing competing products for digital television and other broadband communication applications. Because our products often are building block semiconductors which provide functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits, we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits, some of which may be existing customers that develop their own integrated circuit products. If we cannot offer an attractive solution for applications where our competitors offer more fully integrated tuner/demodulator/video processing products, we may lose significant market share to our competitors. Certain of our competitors have fully integrated tuner/demodulator/video processing solutions targeting high performance cable, satellite, or DTV applications, and thereby potentially provide customers with smaller and cheaper solutions. Some of our targeted customers for our optical interconnect solutions are module makers who are vertically integrated, where we compete with internally supplied components.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. During past periods of downturns in our industry, competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as manufacturers of semiconductors reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand similar adverse economic or market conditions in the future. Moreover, the competitive landscape is changing as a result of consolidation within our industry as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, and other competitors have begun to collaborate with each other. These developments may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, Arris accounted for approximately 31% of our net revenue, and our ten largest customers collectively accounted for approximately 67% of our net revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2013, Arris accounted for approximately 28% of our net revenue, and our ten largest customers collectively accounted for approximately 72% of our net revenue. Sales to Arris as a percentage of revenue include sales to Motorola Home, which was acquired by Arris in April 2013, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers and on the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our RF receivers or RF receiver SoCs. In the future, these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all, may purchase fewer products than they did in the past, or may defer or cancel purchases or otherwise alter their purchasing patterns. Factors that could affect our revenue from these large customers include the following:\n\u2022\nsubstantially all of our sales to date have been made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty; and\n\u2022\nsome of our customers have sought or are seeking relationships with current or potential competitors which may affect their purchasing decisions.\nIn addition, delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic customers and negatively impact sales of the products under development. Moreover, it is possible that our customers may develop their own product or adopt a competitor\u2019s solution for products that they currently buy from us. If that happens, our sales would decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur relationships with some customers may deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products. To attract new customers or retain existing customers, we may offer these customers favorable prices on our products. In that event, our average selling prices and gross margins would decline. The loss of a key customer, a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could seriously impact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is attributable to demand for our products in markets for cable applications.\nPrior to fiscal 2010, sales of our products to customers in the mobile electronic device market and terrestrial market accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in prior periods; however, revenue derived from mobile electronic devices has declined since fiscal 2010 and is no longer an area of focus for us. For fiscal 2012, revenue directly attributable to cable applications accounted for approximately 63% of our net revenue. For fiscal 2013, revenue directly attributable to cable applications accounted for approximately 68% of our net revenue. For fiscal 2014, revenue directly attributable to cable applications accounted for approximately 65% of our net revenue. We expect that cable revenue will continue to represent a meaningful percentage of our total revenues in fiscal 2015 even as we expect the relative percentage to decline, assuming anticipated increases in satellite revenue occur. Delays in the development of, or unexpected developments in, the terrestrial television receiver and cable and satellite applications markets could have an adverse effect on order activity by manufacturers in these markets and, as a result, on our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to penetrate new markets, specifically the market for satellite set-top and gateway boxes and outdoor units, our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCurrently, we sell most of our products to manufacturers of applications for television, cable modems, cable gateways, and cable set-top boxes, and to Chinese manufacturers of terrestrial set top boxes for sale in various markets worldwide. Our future revenue growth, if any, will depend in part on our ability to expand beyond these markets with our RF receivers and RF receiver SoCs, and we have targeted the markets for satellite set-top and gateway boxes and outdoor units, and physical medium devices for optical interconnects as our next market opportunities. Each of these markets presents distinct and substantial risks. If any of these markets do not develop as we currently anticipate, or if we are unable to penetrate them successfully, it could materially and adversely affect our revenue and revenue growth rate, if any.\nWe expect cable data modems/gateways and cable and satellite set top boxes and video gateways to represent our largest North American and European target market. The North American and European cable set top box market is dominated by only a few OEMs, including Cisco Systems, Inc., Arris Group, Inc., Pace plc, Humax Co., Ltd., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Technicolor S.A. These OEMs are large, multinational corporations with substantial negotiating power relative to us. Securing design wins with any of these companies requires a substantial investment of our time and resources. Even if we succeed, additional testing and operational certifications will be required by the OEMs\u2019 customers, which include large cable television companies such as Comcast Corporation, Time Warner Cable Inc., DIRECTV, and EchoStar Corporation. In addition, our products will need to be compatible with other components in our customers\u2019 designs, including components produced by our competitors or potential competitors. There can be no assurance that these other companies will support or continue to support our products.\nIf we fail to penetrate these or other new markets upon which we target our resources, our revenue and revenue growth rate, if any, likely will decrease over time and our financial condition could suffer.\nWe may be unable to make the substantial and productive research and development investments which are required to remain competitive in our business.\nThe semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products. Many of our products originated with our research and development efforts and we believe have provided us with a significant competitive advantage. Our research and development expense was $56.6 million in 2014, $53.1 million in 2013 and $46.5 million in 2012. In 2014, we continued to increase our research and development expenditures as part of our strategy of devoting focused research and development efforts on the development of innovative and sustainable product platforms. We are committed to investing in new product development internally in order to stay competitive in our markets and plan to maintain research and development and design capabilities for new solutions in advanced semiconductor process nodes such as 40nm and 28nm and beyond. We do not know whether we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development required to remain competitive as semiconductor\nprocess nodes continue to shrink and become increasingly complex. In addition, we cannot assure you that the technologies which are the focus of our research and development expenditures will become commercially successful.\nThe complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses caused by undetected defects or bugs, which could reduce the market acceptance of our new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and adversely affect our operating costs.\nHighly complex products like our RF receivers and RF receiver SoCs and physical medium devices for optical modules may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. Due to our limited operating history, defects and bugs that may be contained in our products may not yet have manifested. We have previously experienced, and may in the future experience, defects and bugs. If any of our products contains defects or bugs, or has reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we may not be able to successfully correct these problems. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers, and our financial results. In addition, these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers. If any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs, and our operating costs could be adversely affected. These problems may also result in warranty or product liability claims against us by our customers or others that may require us to make significant expenditures to defend these claims or pay damage awards. In the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we compensate the affected customer. We maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance is limited in amount and subject to significant deductibles. There is no guarantee that our insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all claims. We also may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of one of our customers\u2019 products containing one of our devices. The process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources, and we may incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm. Costs or payments made in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAverage selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margins.\nWe may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices. From time to time, we have reduced the average unit price of our products due to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors, and for other reasons, and we expect that we will have to do so again in the future. If we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or introducing new products with higher margins, our revenue and gross margins will suffer. To support our gross margins, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our and our customers\u2019 costs. Failure to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired and our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence. To compete successfully, we must design, develop, market and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability and meet the cost expectations of our customers. The introduction of new products by our competitors, the market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future products obsolete. Our failure to anticipate or timely develop new or enhanced products or technologies in response to technological shifts could result in decreased revenue and our competitors winning more competitive bid processes, known as \u201cdesign wins.\u201d In particular, we may experience difficulties with product design, manufacturing, marketing or certification that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products. If we fail to introduce new or enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers or penetrate new markets in a timely fashion, we will lose market share and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIn particular, we believe that we will need to develop new products in part to respond to changing dynamics and trends in our end user markets, including (among other trends) consolidation among cable and satellite operators, potential industry shifts away from the hardware devices and other technologies that incorporate our products, and changes in consumer television viewing habits and how consumers access and receive broadcast content and digital broadband services. We cannot predict how these trends will continue to develop or how or to what extent they may affect our future revenues and operating results. We believe that we will need to continue to make substantial investments in research and development in an attempt to ensure a product roadmap that anticipates these types of changes; however, we cannot provide any assurances that we will\naccurately predict the direction in which our markets will evolve or that we will be able to develop, market, or sell new products that respond to such changes successfully or in a timely manner, if at all.\nWe recently settled and are currently a party to intellectual property litigation and may face additional claims of intellectual property infringement. Current litigation and any future litigation could be time-consuming, costly to defend or settle and result in the loss of significant rights.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by companies that hold large numbers of patents and other intellectual property rights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce intellectual property rights. Third parties have in the past and may in the future assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.\nOn January 21, 2014, CrestaTech Technology Corporation, or CrestaTech, filed a complaint for patent infringement against us in the United States District Court of Delaware (the \u201cDistrict Court Litigation\u201d). In its complaint, CrestaTech alleges that we infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,075,585 and 7,265,792. In addition to asking for compensatory damages, CrestaTech alleges willful infringement and seeks a permanent injunction. CrestaTech also names Sharp Corporation, Sharp Electronics Corp. and VIZIO, Inc. as defendants based upon their alleged use of our television tuners. On January 28, 2014, CrestaTech filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC, alleging that we, Sharp, Sharp Electronics, and VIZIO, infringe the same patents asserted in the Delaware action. On May 16, 2014 the ITC granted CrestaTech\u2019s motion to file an amended complaint adding six OEM Respondents, namely, SIO International, Inc., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corp., Wistron Infocomm Technology (America) Corp., Top Victory Investments Ltd. and TPV International (USA), Inc. CrestaTech filed the amended complaint on June 12, 2014, alleging that the Company\u2019s accused products are imported into and sold within the United States by, or on behalf of, the Company, Sharp, Sharp Electronics, VIZIO and the six OEM Respondents. Through its ITC complaints, CrestaTech seeks an exclusion order preventing entry into the United States of certain of our television tuners and televisions containing such tuners from Sharp, Sharp Electronics, and VIZIO. CrestaTech also seeks a cease and desist order prohibiting these defendants from engaging in the importation into, sale for importation into, the sale after importation of, or otherwise transferring within the United States certain of our television tuners or televisions containing such tuners. The target date for completing the ITC investigation is June 29, 2015. The District Court litigation is currently stayed.\nNotwithstanding the completion of the ITC trial and post-trial briefing, our overall litigation with CrestaTech is still in the early stages, and we have not recorded an accrual for loss contingencies associated with the litigation; determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable or reasonably possible; or determined that the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable.\nClaims that our products, processes or technology infringe third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution and including the CrestaTech claims, could be costly to defend or settle and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. In addition, many of our customer and distributor agreements require us to indemnify and defend our customers or distributors from third-party infringement claims and pay damages in the case of adverse rulings. Claims of this sort also could harm our relationships with our customers or distributors and might deter future customers from doing business with us. In order to maintain our relationships with existing customers and secure business from new customers, we have been required from time to time to provide additional assurances beyond our standard terms. If any future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:\n\u2022\ncease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages for infringement;\n\u2022\nexpend significant resources to develop non-infringing products, processes or technology;\n\u2022\nlicense technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\ncross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor; or\n\u2022\npay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue their use of or to replace infringing technology sold to them with non-infringing technology.\nAny of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in some countries. Some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application. We cannot guarantee that:\n\u2022\nany of our present or future patents or patent claims will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned;\n\u2022\nour intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us;\n\u2022\nour ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes will not be limited by our agreements with third parties;\n\u2022\nany of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;\n\u2022\nour intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak;\n\u2022\nany of the trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned; or\n\u2022\nwe will not lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against or to license our technology to others and collect royalties or other payments.\nIn addition, our competitors or others may design around our protected patents or technologies. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or more limited in one or more relevant jurisdictions relative to those protections available in the United States, or may not be applied for in one or more relevant jurisdictions. If we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights, an adverse decision in any of these legal actions could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may have occurred or may occur in the future. Although we have taken steps to minimize the risk of this occurring, any such failure to identify unauthorized use and otherwise adequately protect our intellectual property would adversely affect our business. Moreover, if we are required to commence litigation, whether as a plaintiff or defendant as has occurred with CrestaTech, not only will this be time-consuming, but we will also be forced to incur significant costs and divert our attention and efforts of our employees, which could, in turn, result in lower revenue and higher expenses.\nWe also rely on customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees and consultants, and we implement security measures to protect our trade secrets. We cannot assure you that these contractual protections and security measures will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our suppliers, employees or consultants will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of such contracts.\nIn addition, we have a number of third-party patent and intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time payments or ongoing royalty payments. Also, a few of our license agreements contain most-favored nation clauses or other price restriction clauses which may affect the amount we may charge for our products, processes or technology. We cannot guarantee that the third-party patents and technology we license will not be licensed to our competitors or others in the semiconductor industry. In the future, we may need to obtain additional licenses, renew existing license agreements or otherwise replace existing technology. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed or the technology can be replaced on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWhen we settled a trademark dispute with Linear Technology Corporation, we agreed not to register the \u201cMAXLINEAR\u201d mark or any other marks containing the term \u201cLINEAR\u201d. We may continue to use \u201cMAXLINEAR\u201d as a corporate identifier, including to advertise our products and services, but may not use that mark on our products. The agreement does not affect our ability to use our registered trademark \u201cMxL\u201d, which we use on our products. Due to our agreement not to register the \u201cMAXLINEAR\u201d mark, our ability to effectively prevent third parties from using the \u201cMAXLINEAR\u201d mark in connection with similar products or technology may be affected. If we are unable to protect our trademarks, we may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition and customer loyalty.\nOur business, revenue and revenue growth, if any, will depend in part on the timing and development of the global transition from analog to digital television, which is subject to numerous regulatory and business risks outside our control.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, sales of our RF receiver products used in digital terrestrial television applications, or DTT, including digital televisions, PCTV, IPTV, terrestrial set top boxes, and terrestrial receivers in satellite video gateways represented a significant portion of our revenues. We expect a significant portion of our revenue in future periods to continue to depend on the demand for DTT applications. In contrast to the United States, where the transition from analog to digital television occurred on a national basis in June 2009, in Europe and other parts of the world, the digital transition is being phased in on a local and regional basis and is expected to occur over many years. Many countries in Eastern Europe and Latin America are expected to convert to digital television by the end of 2018, with other countries targeting dates as late as 2024. As a result, our future revenue will depend in part on government mandates requiring conversion from analog to digital television and on the timing and implementation of those mandates. If the ongoing global transition to digital TV standards does not continue to progress or experiences significant delays, our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. If during the transition to digital TV standards, consumers disproportionately purchase TV\u2019s with digital or hybrid tuning capabilities, this could diminish the size of the market for our digital-to-analog converter set-top box solutions, and as result our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nGlobal economic conditions, including factors that adversely affect consumer spending for the products that incorporate our integrated circuits, could adversely affect our revenues, margins, and operating results.\nOur products are incorporated in numerous consumer devices, and demand for our products will ultimately be driven by consumer demand for products such as televisions, automobiles, cable modems, and set top boxes. Many of these purchases are discretionary. Global economic volatility and economic volatility in the specific markets in which the devices that incorporate our products are ultimately sold can cause extreme difficulties for our customers and third-party vendors in accurately forecasting and planning future business activities. This unpredictability could cause our customers to reduce spending on our products, which would delay and lengthen sales cycles. Furthermore, during challenging economic times our customers may face challenges in gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us. In addition, our recent revenue growth has been attributable in large part to purchases of digital-to-analog set top converter boxes in various geographies including Europe. Partially in response to economic and political developments, Greece recently extended the date for its deadline for switching to exclusive digital television broadcasts. Similar extensions in other European countries could adversely affect our revenue and growth. These events, together with economic volatility that may face the broader economy and, in particular, the semiconductor and communications industries, may adversely affect, our business, particularly to the extent that consumers decrease their discretionary spending for devices deploying our products.\nWe rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products, and the failure to manage our relationships with our third-party contractors successfully could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products.\nWe do not have our own manufacturing facilities. We operate an outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities. As a result, we rely on third-party foundry wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity, including sole sourcing for many components or products. Currently, all of our products are manufactured by United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Global Foundries, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, at foundries in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and China. We also use third-party contractors for all of our assembly and test operations.\nRelying on third party manufacturing, assembly and testing presents significant risks to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nfailure by us, our customers, or their end customers to qualify a selected supplier;\n\u2022\ncapacity shortages during periods of high demand;\n\u2022\nreduced control over delivery schedules and quality;\n\u2022\nshortages of materials;\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nlimited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us; and\n\u2022\npotential increases in prices.\nThe ability and willingness of our third-party contractors to perform is largely outside our control. If one or more of our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, in the event that manufacturing capacity is reduced or eliminated at one or more facilities, including as a response to the recent worldwide decline in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing could be disrupted, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders and our net revenue could decline. In addition, if these third parties fail to deliver quality products and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders, our net revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our manufacturing capacity may be similarly reduced or eliminated at one or more facilities due to the fact that our fabrication and assembly and test contractors are all located in the Pacific Rim region, principally in China, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. The risk of earthquakes in these geographies is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines, and Taiwan in particular is also subject to typhoons and other Pacific storms. Earthquakes, fire, flooding, or other natural disasters in Taiwan or the Pacific Rim region, or political unrest, war, labor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such as outbreaks of H1N1 flu, in countries where our contractors\u2019 facilities are located could result in the disruption of our foundry, assembly or test capacity. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembly or test from the affected contractor to another third-party vendor. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe do not have any long-term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers or suppliers, and any disruption in our supply of products or materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and operating results.\nWe currently do not have long-term supply contracts with any of our third-party vendors, including UMC, Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Global Foundries, and SMIC. We make substantially all of our purchases on a purchase order basis, and neither UMC nor our other contract manufacturers are required to supply us products for any specific period or in any specific quantity. Foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. Availability of foundry capacity has in the past been reduced from time to time due to strong demand. Foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies\u2019 products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice. It is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are, or that have long-term agreements with our foundry, may induce our foundry to reallocate capacity to them. This reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need. We expect that it would take approximately nine to twelve months to transition performance of our foundry or assembly services to new providers. Such a transition would likely require a qualification process by our customers or their end customers. We generally place orders for products with some of our suppliers approximately four to five months prior to the anticipated delivery date, with order volumes based on our forecasts of demand from our customers. Accordingly, if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may be unable to obtain adequate and cost-effective foundry or assembly capacity from our third-party contractors to meet our customers\u2019 delivery requirements, or we may accumulate excess inventories. On occasion, we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer purchase orders and therefore were unable to benefit from this incremental demand. None of our third-party contractors has provided any assurance to us that adequate capacity will be available to us within the time required to meet additional demand for our products.\nTo address capacity considerations, we are in the process of qualifying additional semiconductor fabricators. Qualification will not occur if we identify a defect in a fabricator\u2019s manufacturing process or if our customers choose not to invest the time and expense required to qualify the proposed fabricator. If full qualification of a fabricator does not occur, we may not be able to sell all of the materials produced by this fabricator or to fulfill demand for our products, which would adversely affect our business, revenue and operating results. In addition, the resulting write-off of unusable inventories would have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may have difficulty accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses particularly as we seek to enter new markets where we may not have prior experience.\nOur recent operating history has focused on developing integrated circuits for specific terrestrial and cable television applications, and as part of our strategy, we seek to expand our addressable market into new product categories. For example, we have recently expanded into the market for satellite set-top and gateway boxes and outdoor units and physical medium devices for the optical interconnect markets. Our limited operating experience in new markets or potential markets we may enter, combined with the rapidly evolving nature of our markets in general, substantial uncertainty concerning how these markets may develop and other factors beyond our control, reduces our ability to accurately forecast quarterly or annual revenue. We are currently expanding our staffing and increasing our expense levels in anticipation of future revenue growth. If our revenue does not increase as anticipated, we could incur significant losses due to our higher expense levels if we are not able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall in future revenue.\nWe may not sustain our growth rate, and we may not be able to manage future growth effectively.\nWe have experienced significant growth in a short period of time. Our net revenue increased from approximately $97.7 million in 2012 to approximately $119.6 million in 2013 and approximately $133.1 million in 2014. We may not achieve similar growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance. If we are unable to maintain adequate revenue growth, our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline.\nTo manage our growth successfully and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must effectively, among other things:\n\u2022\nrecruit, hire, train and manage additional qualified engineers for our research and development activities, especially in the positions of design engineering, product and test engineering and applications engineering;\n\u2022\nadd sales personnel and expand customer engineering support offices;\n\u2022\nimplement and improve our administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls; and\n\u2022\nenhance our information technology support for enterprise resource planning and design engineering by adapting and expanding our systems and tool capabilities, and properly training new hires as to their use.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new products and we may fail to satisfy customer requirements, maintain product quality, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, especially our design and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel, including our management, sales and marketing and finance, and especially our design and technical personnel. We do not know whether we will be able to retain all of these personnel as we continue to pursue our business strategy. Historically, we have encountered difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers because there is a limited pool of engineers with the expertise required in our field. Competition for these personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees, especially our key design and technical personnel, or our inability to retain, attract and motivate qualified design and technical personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team.\nOur success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, in particular, the services of Kishore Seendripu, Ph.D., our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Curtis Ling, Ph.D., our Chief Technical Officer and a Director, and Madhukar Reddy, Ph.D., our Vice President, Central Engineering. None of our senior management team is bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period. In addition, we have not entered into non-compete agreements with members of our senior management team. The loss of any member of our senior management team could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.\nOur customers require our products and our third-party contractors to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process which does not assure product sales.\nPrior to purchasing our products, our customers require that both our products and our third-party contractors undergo extensive qualification processes, which involve testing of the products in the customer\u2019s system and rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or more. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not assure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the RF receiver or RF receiver SoC and physical medium devices for optical modules, changes in our customer\u2019s manufacturing process or our selection of a new supplier may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, sales of this product to the customer may be precluded or delayed, which may impede our growth and cause our business to suffer.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our distributors\u2019 product inventories and product sell-through. Should any of our distributors cease or be forced to stop distributing our products, our business would suffer.\nWe currently sell a significant but declining portion of our products to customers through our distributors, who maintain their own inventories of our products. For fiscal 2012, sales through distributors accounted for 40% of our net revenue. For fiscal 2013, sales through distributors accounted for 29% of our net revenue. For fiscal 2014, sales through distributors accounted for 28% of our net revenue. For these distributor transactions, revenue is not recognized until product is shipped to the end customer and the amount that will ultimately be collected is fixed or determinable. Upon shipment of product to these distributors, title to the inventory transfers to the distributor and the distributor is invoiced, generally with 30 day terms. On shipments to our distributors where revenue is not recognized, we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment, relieving the inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor, and record the corresponding gross profit in the consolidated balance sheet as a component of deferred revenue and deferred profit, representing the difference between the receivable recorded and the cost of inventory shipped. Future pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights from our distributors may result in the realization of a different amount of profit included our future consolidated statements of operations than the amount recorded as deferred profit in our consolidated balance sheets.\nIf our distributors are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventories of our products in a given quarter to manufacturers and end users or if they decide to decrease their inventories of our products for any reason, our sales through these distributors and our revenue may decline. In addition, if some distributors decide to purchase more of our products than are required to satisfy end customer demand in any particular quarter, inventories at these distributors would grow in that quarter. These distributors likely would reduce future orders until inventory levels realign with end customer demand, which could adversely affect our product revenue in a subsequent quarter.\nOur reserve estimates with respect to the products stocked by our distributors are based principally on reports provided to us by our distributors, typically on a weekly basis. To the extent that this resale and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not received in a timely manner, we may not be able to make reserve estimates for future periods accurately or at all.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, and differences between our estimates of customer demand and product mix and our actual results could negatively affect our inventory levels, sales and operating results.\nOur revenue is generated on the basis of purchase orders with our customers rather than long-term purchase commitments. In addition, our customers can cancel purchase orders or defer the shipments of our products under certain circumstances. Our products are manufactured using a silicon foundry according to our estimates of customer demand, which requires us to make separate demand forecast assumptions for every customer, each of which may introduce significant variability into our aggregate estimate. We have limited visibility into future customer demand and the product mix that our customers will require, which could adversely affect our revenue forecasts and operating margins. Moreover, because our target markets are relatively new, many of our customers have difficulty accurately forecasting their product requirements and estimating the timing of their new product introductions, which ultimately affects their demand for our products. Historically, because of this limited visibility, actual results have been different from our forecasts of customer demand. Some of these differences have been material, leading to excess inventory or product shortages and revenue and margin forecasts above those we were actually able to achieve. These differences may occur in the future, and the adverse impact of these differences between forecasts and actual results could grow if we are successful in selling more products to some customers. In addition, the rapid pace of innovation in our industry could render significant portions of our inventory obsolete. Excess or obsolete inventory levels could result in unexpected expenses or increases in our reserves that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we were to underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity were unavailable, we could forego revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any significant future cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products due to manufacturing defects could materially and adversely impact our profit margins, increase our write-offs due to product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.\nWinning business is subject to lengthy competitive selection processes that require us to incur significant expenditures. Even if we begin a product design, customers may decide to cancel or change their product plans, which could cause us to generate no revenue from a product and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are focused on securing design wins to develop RF receivers and RF receiver SoCs and physical medium devices for optical modules for use in our customers\u2019 products. These selection processes typically are lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that some of our customers\u2019 products\nlikely will have short life cycles. Failure to obtain a design win could prevent us from offering an entire generation of a product, even though this has not occurred to date. This could cause us to lose revenue and require us to write off obsolete inventory, and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes.\nAfter securing a design win, we may experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development cycle typically required. Our customers generally take a considerable amount of time to evaluate our products. The typical time from early engagement by our sales force to actual product introduction runs from nine to twelve months for the consumer market, to as much as 36 months for the cable operator market. The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated sales. In addition, any delay or cancellation of a customer\u2019s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue. Finally, our customers\u2019 failure to successfully market and sell their products could reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were unable to generate revenue after incurring substantial expenses to develop any of our products, our business would suffer.\nOur operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and on an annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\nchanges in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers;\n\u2022\nthe receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products and our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe timing and extent of product development costs;\n\u2022\nnew product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nincurrence of research and development and related new product expenditures;\n\u2022\nseasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in IC manufacturing yields;\n\u2022\nsignificant warranty claims, including those not covered by our suppliers;\n\u2022\nchanges in our product mix or customer mix;\n\u2022\nintellectual property disputes;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers;\n\u2022\nimpairment of long-lived assets, including masks and production equipment; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products.\nThe foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. We typically are required to incur substantial development costs in advance of a prospective sale with no certainty that we will ever recover these costs. A substantial amount of time may pass between a design win and the generation of revenue related to the expenses previously incurred, which can potentially cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively\nfixed in nature due to our significant sales, research and development costs. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify its adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Any future downturns may result in diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Furthermore, any upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased competition for access to third-party foundry and assembly capacity. We are dependent on the availability of this capacity to manufacture and assemble our RF receivers and RF receiver SoCs and physical medium devices for optical modules. None of our third-party foundry or assembly contractors has provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us in the future. A significant downturn or upturn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nThe use of open source software in our products, processes and technology may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nOur products, processes and technology sometimes utilize and incorporate software that is subject to an open source license. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user\u2019s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user\u2019s software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost. This can subject previously proprietary software to open source license terms.\nWhile we monitor the use of all open source software in our products, processes and technology and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product, processes or technology when we do not wish to do so, such use could inadvertently occur. Additionally, if a third party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our products, processes or technology, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our products, processes or technology. This could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services and technology necessary for the operation of our business. Any failure of one or more of our partners, vendors, suppliers or licensors to provide these services or technology could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide critical services, including, among other things, services related to accounting, billing, human resources, information technology, network development, network monitoring, in-licensing and intellectual property that we cannot or do not create or provide ourselves. We depend on these vendors to ensure that our corporate infrastructure will consistently meet our business requirements. The ability of these third-party vendors to successfully provide reliable and high quality services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties that are beyond our control. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, our agreements with these vendors limit the amount of damages we may receive. In addition, we do not know whether we will be able to collect on any award of damages or that these damages would be sufficient to cover the actual costs we would incur as a result of any vendor\u2019s failure to perform under its agreement with us. Any failure of our corporate infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.\nAdditionally, we incorporate third-party technology into and with some of our products, and we may do so in future products. The operation of our products could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party technology we use. It may be more difficult for us to correct any errors in a timely manner if at all because the development and maintenance of the technology is not within our control. There can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to make their technology, or improvements to the technology, available to us, or that they will continue to support and maintain their technology. Further, due to the limited number of vendors of some types of technology, it may be difficult to obtain new licenses or replace existing technology. Any impairment of the technology or our relationship with these third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or unanticipated tax obligations could affect our future results.\nSince we operate in different countries and are subject to taxation in different jurisdictions, our future effective tax rates could be impacted by changes in such countries\u2019 tax laws or their interpretations. Both domestic and international tax laws are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulation and court rulings. The application of these tax laws and related regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. We cannot determine whether any legislative proposals may be enacted into law or what, if any, changes may be made to such proposals prior to their being enacted into law. If U.S. or international tax laws change in a manner that increases our tax obligation, it could result in a material adverse impact on our net income and our financial position.\nThe Federal examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the years 2010 and 2011 was completed during the three months ended March 31, 2014. The Company is still subject to examination for 2012 and 2013. In the event we are determined to have any unaccrued tax obligation arising from future audits, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nOur future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies. On a periodic basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we will recognize a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future U.S. taxable income. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we established a full valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.\nWe sell our products throughout the world. Products shipped to Asia accounted for 94% of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, approximately 34% of our employees are located outside of the United States. All of our products are manufactured, assembled and tested in Asia, and all of our major distributors are located in Asia. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include:\n\u2022\nchanges in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs;\n\u2022\ndisruptions of capital and trading markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays;\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances or political instability;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups;\n\u2022\npublic health emergencies;\n\u2022\ndiffering employment practices and labor standards;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices;\n\u2022\nnationalization and expropriation;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations relating to our international operating activities; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining distribution and support.\nIn addition to a significant portion of our wafer supply coming from Singapore, China and Malaysia, substantially all of our products undergo packaging and final test in Taiwan. Any conflict or uncertainty in this country, including due to natural disaster or public health or safety concerns, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the government of any country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards for products manufactured in or imported into their country that are not widely shared, it may lead some of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country, require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt cross-border manufacturing relationships which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also are subject to risks associated with international political conflicts involving the U.S. government. For example, in 2008 we were instructed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to cease using Polar Star International Company Limited, a distributor based in Hong Kong, that delivered third-party products, to a political group that the U.S. government did not believe should have been provided with the products in question. As a result, we immediately ceased all business operations with that distributor. The loss of Polar Star as a distributor did not materially delay shipment of our products because Polar Star was a non-exclusive distributor and we had in place alternative distribution arrangements. However, we cannot provide assurances that similar disruptions of distribution arrangements in the future will not result in delayed shipments until we are able to identify alternative distribution channels, which could include a requirement to increase our direct sales efforts. Loss of a key distributor under similar circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business, revenues and operating results.\nIf we suffer losses to our facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\nOur facilities and distribution system, and those of our third-party contractors, are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood or other natural or man-made disasters. A number of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are located in areas with above average seismic activity. The foundries that manufacture all of our wafers are located in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and China, and all of the third-party contractors who assemble and test our products also are located in Asia. In addition, our headquarters are located in Southern California. The risk of an earthquake in the Pacific Rim region or Southern California is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines. For example, in 2002 and 2003, major earthquakes occurred in Taiwan. Any catastrophic loss to any of these facilities would likely disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility.\nOur business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nOur business is subject to various international and U.S. laws and other legal requirements, including packaging, product content, labor, import/export control regulations, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to conduct our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.\nOur products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. If we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations, our business could be harmed.\nFor example, the SEC recently adopted a final rule to implement Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which requires new disclosures concerning the use of conflict minerals, generally tantalum, tin, gold, or tungsten, that originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. These disclosures are required whether or not these products containing conflict minerals are manufactured by us or third parties. Verifying the source of any conflict minerals in our products will create additional costs in order to comply with the new disclosure requirements and we may not be able to certify that the metals in our products are conflict free, which may create issues with our customers. In addition, the new rule may affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products.\nWe must conform the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, we could be required to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\nIn addition to our acquisition of Physpeed, we may, from time to time, make additional business acquisitions or investments, which involve significant risks.\nIn addition to the acquisition of Physpeed, which we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we may, from time to time, make acquisitions, enter into alliances or make investments in other businesses to complement our existing product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. However, any such transactions could result in:\n\u2022\nissuances of equity securities dilutive to our existing stockholders;\n\u2022\nsubstantial cash payments;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nlarge one-time write-offs;\n\u2022\namortization expenses related to intangible assets;\n\u2022\na limitation on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired business.\nAdditionally, in periods subsequent to an acquisition, we must evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.\nIntegrating acquired organizations and their products and services, including the integration of Physpeed following completion of the acquisition, may be expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationships with employees, customers and suppliers, and ultimately may not be successful. The benefits or synergies we may expect from the acquisition of complementary or supplementary businesses may not be realized to the extent or in the time frame we initially anticipate. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies, including Physpeed, include those associated with:\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the acquired products or technology;\n\u2022\nconforming the acquired company\u2019s standards, policies, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n\u2022\ncoordinating new product and process development, especially with respect to highly complex technologies;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees or customers of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nhiring additional management and other critical personnel;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of facilities, integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource and other administrative functions and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\nthe geographic distance between the companies;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims for terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nWe may be subject to information technology failures, including data protection breaches and cyber-attacks, that could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.\nWe rely on our information technology systems for the effective operation of our business and for the secure maintenance and storage of confidential data relating to our business and third party businesses. Although we have implemented security controls to protect our information technology systems, experienced programmers or hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls, and develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that compromise our confidential information or that of third parties and cause a disruption or failure of our information technology systems. Any such compromise of our information technology systems could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, result in the unauthorized release of customer, supplier or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation, or damage our reputation. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures either as a response to specific breaches or as a result of evolving risks, could be significant. In addition, our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could adversely affect the timely and efficient operation of our business. Any delayed sales, significant costs or lost customers resulting from these technology failures could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nThird parties with which we conduct business, such as foundries, assembly and test contractors, and distributors, have access to certain portions of our sensitive data. In the event that these third parties do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches could result and negatively impact our business, operations and financial results.\nInvestor confidence may be adversely impacted if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and as a result, our stock price could decline.\nWe are subject to rules adopted by the Securities Exchange Commission, or SEC, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require us to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K our management\u2019s report on, and assessment of the effectiveness of, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the requirements imposed by Section 404. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. Any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements and could result in investigations or sanctions by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, or other regulatory authorities or in stockholder litigation. Any of these factors ultimately could harm our business and could negatively impact the market price of our securities. Ineffective control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\nOur products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted by end users in our markets.\nGenerally, our products comprise only a part of a communications device. All components of these devices must uniformly comply with industry standards in order to operate efficiently together. We depend on companies that provide other components of the devices to support prevailing industry standards. Many of these companies are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our customers or end users. If larger companies do not support the same industry standards that we do, or if competing standards emerge, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected, which would harm our business.\nProducts for communications applications are based on industry standards that are continually evolving. Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards. The emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins. We may not be successful in developing\nor using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance. Our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense.\nRisks Relating to Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our charter documents will have the effect of allowing our founders, executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates to limit your ability to influence corporate matters that you may consider unfavorable.\nWe sold Class A common stock in our initial public offering. Our founders, executive officers, directors and their affiliates and employees hold shares of our Class B common stock, which is not publicly traded. Until March 29, 2017, the dual class structure of our common stock will have the following effects with respect to the holders of our Class A common stock:\n\u2022\nallows the holders of our Class B common stock to have the sole right to elect two management directors to the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nwith respect to change of control matters, allows the holders of our Class B common stock to have ten votes per share compared to the holders of our Class A common stock who will have one vote per share on these matters; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to the adoption of or amendments to our equity incentive plans, allows the holders of our Class B common stock to have ten votes per share compared to the holders of our Class A common stock who will have one vote per share on these matters, subject to certain limitations.\nThus, our dual class structure will limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including with respect to transactions involving a change of control, and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition to the additional voting rights granted to holders of our Class B common stock, which is held principally by certain of our executive officers and founders, we have entered change of control agreements with our executive officers, which could have an adverse effect on a third party\u2019s willingness to consider acquiring us, either because it may be more difficult to retain key employees with change of control benefits or because of the incremental cost associated with these benefits.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with our founders will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and their interests may differ from other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our founders, including our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Seendripu, together control approximately 17% of our outstanding capital stock, representing approximately 61% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock with respect to change of control matters and the adoption of or amendment to our equity incentive plans. Dr. Seendripu and the other founders therefore have significant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of two Class B directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of MaxLinear or its assets, for the foreseeable future.\nOur management team may use our available cash, cash equivalents, and liquid investment assets in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a return.\nWe use our cash, cash equivalents, and liquid investment assets for general corporate purposes, including working capital. We may also use a portion of these assets to acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies, including the acquisition of Physpeed. Our management has considerable discretion in the application of our cash, cash equivalents, and investment resources, and you will not have the opportunity to assess whether these liquid assets are being used in a manner that you deem best to maximize your return. We may use our available resources for corporate purposes that do not increase our operating results or market value. In addition, our cash, cash equivalents, and liquid investment resources may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions provide for the following:\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 25,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, our President or by unanimous written consent of our directors appointed by the holders of Class B common stock;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nestablish that our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered terms and with one Class B director being elected to each of Classes II and III;\n\u2022\nprovide for a dual class common stock structure, which provides our founders, current investors, executives and employees with significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum, other than any vacancy in the two directorships reserved for the designees of the holders of Class B common stock, which may be filled only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B common stock or by the remaining director elected by the Class B common stock (with the consent of founders holding a majority in interest of the Class B common stock over which the founders then exercise voting control);\n\u2022\nspecify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter documents.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.\nOur share price may be volatile as a result of limited trading volume and other factors.\nOur shares of Class A common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2010. An active public market for our shares on the New York Stock Exchange may not be sustained. In particular, limited trading volumes and liquidity may limit the ability of stockholders to purchase or sell our common stock in the amounts and at the times they wish. Trading volume in our Class A common stock tends to be modest relative to our total outstanding shares, and the price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate substantially (particularly in percentage terms) without regard to news about us or general trends in the stock market. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nIn addition, the trading price of our Class A common stock could become highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and others such as:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\noverall conditions in the semiconductor market;\n\u2022\naddition or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022\nsales of our Class A or Class B common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets recently have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, especially due to our dual-class voting structure, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, especially with respect to our unique dual-class voting structure as to the election of directors, change of control matters and matters related to our equity incentive plans. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock in the public market could cause our share price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2014, we had 30.9 million shares of Class A common stock and 7.0 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding.\nAll shares of Class A common stock are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, except for any shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nWe have filed registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register 16.9 million shares of our Class A common stock for issuance under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. These shares may be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to other restrictions provided under the terms of the applicable plan and/or the option agreements entered into with option holder.\nOur Executive Incentive Bonus Plan permits the settlement of awards under the plan in the form of shares of its Class A common stock. For the 2013 and 2012 performance period, actual awards under the Executive Incentive Bonus Plan were settled in Class A common stock issued under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, with the number of shares issuable to plan participants determined based on the closing sales price of our Class A common stock as determined in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 9, 2014 and May 3, 2013, respectively. Additionally, we settled all bonus awards for all other employees for the 2013 and 2012 performance period in shares of its Class A common stock. We issued 0.6 million shares\nof our Class A common stock for the 2013 performance period upon settlement of the bonus awards on May 9, 2014. We issued 0.8 million shares of our Class A common stock for the 2012 performance period upon settlement of the bonus awards on May 3, 2013. We intend to settle all bonus awards for employees for the 2014 performance period in shares of our Class A common stock. We cannot currently predict when the bonus awards will be settled, but we currently anticipate that approximately 0.4 million shares of our Class A common stock will be issued for the 2014 performance period. These shares may be freely sold in the public market immediately following the issuance of such shares and the issuance of such shares may have an adverse effect on our share price once they are issued.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.", "PERMNO": 93289, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "MXL"}
