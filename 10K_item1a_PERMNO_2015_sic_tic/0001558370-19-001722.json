{"cik": "901491", "company": "PAPA JOHNS INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to risks that could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks could cause actual operating results to differ from those expressed in certain \u201cforward looking statements\u201d contained in this Form 10-K as well as in other Company communications. Before you invest in our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all other information included in this Form 10-K and our other publicly filed documents.\nWe have recently experienced negative publicity and consumer sentiment as a result of statements by the Company\u2019s founder and former spokesperson, John H. Schnatter, which may continue to negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn July 2018, the Company was the subject of significant negative media reports as a result of certain statements by Mr. Schnatter, who resigned as Chairman of the Board on July 11, 2018. The negative media continued throughout the third quarter of 2018, and the resultant negative consumer sentiment continued throughout the remainder of the 2018 fiscal year.\nAs a result of the recent negative publicity and consumer sentiment, the Company has experienced a decline in sales and operating profits. This decline may continue if the negative consumer sentiment toward the Company continues or worsens. If Mr. Schnatter makes further statements that create controversy or harm the Company\u2019s reputation, it may take longer for our sales and consumer perception of our brand to improve.\nWe will incur costs related to addressing and remediating the impact of recent negative publicity surrounding our brand as a result of John H. Schnatter, which will adversely impact our financial performance.\nIn connection with the controversy surrounding Mr. Schnatter, a Special Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of all of the independent directors, was formed to evaluate and take action with respect to all of the Company\u2019s relationships and arrangements with Mr. Schnatter. Following its formation, the Special Committee terminated Mr. Schnatter\u2019s Founder Agreement, which defined his role in the Company, among other things, as advertising and brand spokesperson for the Company.\nIn connection with these and other actions, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant non-recurring costs in 2019, including costs related to branding initiatives, marketing and advertising expenses and increased professional fees. In addition, the Company materially increased its franchisee financial assistance in 2018 in an effort to mitigate store closings, and expects to continue some additional level of assistance in 2019. These costs and any additional costs we may incur to support these initiatives are expected to adversely affect our profitability and financial performance. There is no guarantee that our actions will be effective in attracting customers back to our restaurants and mitigating negative sales trends.\nThe recent negative publicity has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business, and may have a long-term effect on our relationships with our customers, partners and franchisees.\nOur business and reputation has been negatively affected by the recent negative publicity resulting from Mr. Schnatter\u2019s statements. If we are unable to rebuild the trust of our customers, franchisees, business partners and suppliers, and if further negative publicity continues, we could experience a substantial negative impact on our business. We have experienced claims and litigation as a consequence of these matters, including a shareholder class action in connection with a decline in our stock price and litigation with Mr. Schnatter. Related legal expenses of defending these claims have negatively impacted our operating results. Continuing higher legal fees, potential new claims, liabilities from existing cases and continuing negative publicity could continue to have a negative impact on operating results.\nWe have experienced declining sales, and we cannot assure that we will be able to halt or reverse the decline.\nOur system-wide North America and International comparable sales declined on a year-over-year basis in 2018. The Company\u2019s revenues and profitability growth depend on the ability to increase comparable restaurant sales, and it is uncertain whether this will occur or could take longer than expected.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a limited duration stockholder rights agreement, which could delay or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by our Board of Directors.\nOn July 22, 2018, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of a limited duration stockholder rights plan (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) with an expiration date of July 22, 2019 and an ownership trigger threshold of 15% (with a threshold of 31% applied to John H. Schnatter, together with his affiliates and family members). In connection with the Rights Plan, the Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 2, 2018 of one preferred share purchase right (a \u201cRight\u201d) for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company. Upon certain triggering events, each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth (subject to adjustment) of one share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) of the Company at an exercise price of $250.00 (the \u201cExercise Price\u201d) per one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock. In addition, if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company\u2019s common stock (or in the case of Mr. Schnatter, 31% or more, and in the case of funds affiliated with Starboard Value LP, additional shares in excess of those issuable upon conversion of their Series B Convertible Preferred Stock) without prior board approval, each holder of a Right (other than the acquiring person or group whose Rights will become void) will have the right to purchase, upon payment of the Exercise Price and in accordance with the terms of the Rights Plan, a number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock having a market value of twice the Exercise Price. On March 5, 2019, the Board of Directors extended the term of the Rights Plan to March 6, 2022, increased the ownership trigger threshold at which a person becomes an acquiring person from 15% to 20%, except as set forth above, removed the \u201cacting in concert\u201d provision in response to stockholder feedback, and included a qualifying offer provision as set forth in the Rights Plan.\nThe Rights Plan is intended to enable all of our stockholders to realize the full potential value of their investment in the Company and to protect the interests of the Company and its stockholders by reducing the likelihood that any person or group gains control of the Company through open market accumulation or other tactics without paying an appropriate control premium. The Rights Plan could render more difficult, or discourage, a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company that is not approved by our Board of Directors. The Rights Plan, however, should not interfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination approved by our Board of Directors. In addition, the Rights Plan does not prevent our Board of Directors from considering any offer that it considers to be in the best interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nOur profitability may suffer as a result of intense competition in our industry.\nThe QSR Pizza industry is mature and highly competitive. Competition is based on price, service, location, food quality, brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, use of technology, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. We may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures, which may adversely affect our profitability. When commodity and other costs increase, we may be limited in our ability to increase prices. With the significant level of competition and the pace of innovation, we may be required to increase investment spending in several areas, particularly marketing and technology, which can decrease profitability.\nIn addition to competition with our larger and more established competitors, we face competition from new competitors such as fast casual pizza concepts. We also face competitive pressures from an array of food delivery concepts and aggregators delivering for quick service or dine in restaurants, using new delivery technologies, some of which may have more effective marketing. The emergence or growth of new competitors, in the pizza category or in the food service industry generally, may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our market share and could negatively impact our sales and our system-wide restaurant operations. We also face increasing competition from other home delivery services and grocery stores that offer an increasing variety of prepped or prepared meals in response to consumer demand. As a result, our sales can be directly and negatively impacted by actions of our competitors, the emergence or growth of new competitors, consumer sentiment or other factors outside our control.\nOne of our competitive strengths is our \u201cBETTER INGREDIENTS. BETTER PIZZA.\u201d brand promise. This means we may use ingredients that cost more than the ingredients some of our competitors may use. Because of our investment in higher-quality ingredients and our focus on a \u201cclean label\u201d, we could have lower profit margins than some of our competitors if we are not able to establish a quality differentiator that resonates with consumers. Our sales may be particularly impacted as competitors increasingly emphasize lower-cost menu options.\nChanges in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could adversely impact our results.\nChanges in consumer preferences and trends (for example, changes in consumer perceptions of certain ingredients that could cause consumers to avoid pizza or some of its ingredients in favor of foods that are or are perceived as healthier, lower-calorie, or lower in carbohydrate or otherwise based on their ingredients or nutritional content). Preferences for a dining experience such as fast casual pizza concepts, could also adversely affect our restaurant business and reduce the effectiveness of our marketing and technology initiatives. Also, our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer income and spending, such as general economic conditions, customer sentiment and the level of employment. Any factors that could cause consumers to spend less on food or shift to lower-priced products could reduce sales or inhibit our ability to maintain or increase pricing, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nFood safety and quality concerns may negatively impact our business and profitability.\nIncidents or reports of food- or water-borne illness or other food safety issues, investigations or other actions by food safety regulators, food contamination or tampering, employee hygiene and cleanliness failures, improper franchisee or employee conduct, or presence of communicable disease at our restaurants (Company-owned and franchised), QC Centers, or suppliers could lead to product liability or other claims. If we were to experience any such incidents or reports, our\nbrand and reputation could be negatively impacted. This could result in a significant decrease in customer traffic and could negatively impact our revenues and profits. Similar incidents or reports occurring at quick service restaurants unrelated to us could likewise create negative publicity, which could negatively impact consumer behavior towards us.\nWe rely on our domestic and international suppliers, as do our franchisees, to provide quality ingredients and to comply with applicable laws and industry standards. A failure of one of our domestic or international suppliers to meet our quality standards, or meet domestic or international food industry standards, could result in a disruption in our supply chain and negatively impact our brand and our results.\nFailure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur results depend upon our ability to differentiate our brand and our reputation for quality. Damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact our business and financial results. Our brand has been highly rated in U.S. surveys, and we strive to build the value of our brand as we develop international markets. As we experienced in 2018, the value of our brand and demand for our products could be damaged by any incidents that harm consumer perceptions of the Company, including negative publicity and consumer sentiment.\nTo be successful in the future, we must work to overcome the negative publicity we experienced in 2018, and preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. Consumer perceptions of our brand are affected by a variety of factors, such as the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the quality of the ingredients we use, our corporate culture, our policies and systems related to diversity, equity and inclusion, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by third parties presenting or promoting adverse commentary or portrayals of our industry, our brand, our suppliers or our franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in managing incidents that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, our brand value and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business.\nIn recent years, there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, chat platforms, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other persons. The rising popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. The dissemination of negative information via social media could harm our business, brand, reputation, marketing partners, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information\u2019s accuracy.\nIn addition, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers and the public in general. Failure to use social media effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue. Other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our brand, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information.\nWe may not be able to effectively market our products or maintain key marketing partnerships.\nThe success of our business depends on the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional plans, and in particular on the success of our efforts to relaunch our brand following the negative publicity we experienced in 2018. We may not be able to effectively execute our national or local marketing plans, particularly if lower sales continue to result in reduced levels of marketing funds. Additionally, our recent launch of an enhanced rewards program to help increase sales may not meet our expectations and could lower profitability. Our marketing strategy historically centered around the Company\u2019s founder as brand spokesperson, and Mr. Schnatter\u2019s removal as brand spokesperson in 2018 created the need for a new marketing strategy. We have also historically utilized relationships with well-known sporting events, professional teams and certain universities to market our products. The negative publicity we experienced in 2018 caused the loss of certain sports and university partnerships, and our business could continue to suffer if we are not able to create a compelling marketing\nstrategy, or maintain or grow key marketing relationships and sponsorships, or if we are unable to do so at a reasonable cost.\nOur business will continue to require additional investments in alternative marketing strategies to address the challenges we faced in 2018. In 2018, we engaged a new advertising agency and introduced a new advertising campaign to focus the consumer\u2019s attention on the core values of our brand. We expect to continue to invest in marketing to support the relaunch of our brand. If these efforts are not effective in increasing sales, we may be required to expend additional funds to effectively improve consumer sentiment and sales, and we may also be required to engage in additional activities to retain customers or attract new customers to the brand. Such marketing expenses and promotional activities, which could include discounting our products, could adversely impact our results.\nPersons or marketing partners who endorse our products could take actions that harm their reputations, which could also cause harm to our brand. From time to time, in response to changes in the business environment and the audience share of marketing channels, we expect to reallocate marketing resources across social media and other channels. That reallocation may not be effective or as successful as the marketing and advertising allocations of our competitors, which could negatively impact the amount and timing of our revenues.\nOur franchise business model presents a number of risks.\nOur success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence over their operations. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. If our franchisees do not experience sales growth, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, especially in emerging markets and/or high cost markets, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, higher levels of required financial support from us, higher numbers of restaurant closures, reduced numbers of restaurant openings, delayed or reduced payments to us, or increased franchisee assistance, which reduces our revenues.\nOur success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our franchisees to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and marketing plans. Franchisees\u2019 ability to continue to grow is also dependent in large part on the availability of franchisee funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees. Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, the brand\u2019s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\nThe issuance of shares of our Series B Preferred Stock to Starboard and its permitted transferees dilutes the ownership and relative voting power of holders of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the \u201cSecurities Purchase Agreement\u201d) among the Company and certain funds affiliated with or managed by Starboard Value LP (\u201cStarboard\u201d), the Company sold 200,000 shares of our newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) to Starboard on February 3, 2019 (the \u201cClosing\u201d), with Starboard having the option to purchase up to an additional 50,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock on or prior to March 29, 2019.\nThe initial shares sold to Starboard at the Closing represent approximately 11% of our outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis, and would represent in the aggregate an estimated 14% of our outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis assuming Starboard exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 50,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of common stock based on the conversion rate determined by dividing $1,000, the stated value of the Series B Preferred Stock, by $50.06.\nBecause holders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock to Starboard effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock into common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock. Furthermore, following expiration of Starboard\u2019s one-year lock-up period, any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We granted Starboard customary registration rights in respect of their shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock. These registration rights would facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales by Starboard of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur Series B Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, result in the interests of Starboard differing from those of our common stockholders and delay or prevent an attempt to take over the Company.\nStarboard, as the holder of our Series B Preferred Stock, has a liquidation preference entitling it to be paid, before any payment may be made to holders of our common stock in connection with a liquidation event, an amount per share of Series B Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (i) the stated value thereof plus accrued and unpaid dividends and (ii) the amount that would have been received had such share of Series B Preferred Stock been converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation event.\nHolders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to a preferential cumulative dividend at the rate of 3.6% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. On the third anniversary of the date of issuance, each holder of Series B Preferred Stock will have the right to increase the dividend on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such holder to 5.6%, and on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance, each holder will have the right to increase the dividend on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such holder to 7.6% (in each case subject to the Company\u2019s right to redeem such shares of Series B Preferred Stock for cash).\nThe holders of our Series B Preferred Stock also have certain redemption rights or put rights, including the right on any date following November 6, 2026 to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Series B Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock also have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Series B Preferred Stock upon certain change of control events.\nThese dividend and share repurchase obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to Starboard, as the initial holder of our Series B Preferred Stock, could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between Starboard and holders of our common stock. Furthermore, a sale of our Company, as a change of control event, may require us to repurchase Series B Preferred Stock, which could have the effect of making an acquisition of the Company more expensive and potentially deterring proposed transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nStarboard may exercise influence over us, including through its ability to designate up to two members of our Board of Directors.\nThe transaction documents entered into in connection with the sale of the Series B Preferred Stock to Starboard grant to Starboard consent rights with respect to certain actions by us, including:\n\u00b7\namending our organizational documents in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the Series B Preferred Stock;\n\u00b7\nissuing securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series B Preferred Stock; and\n\u00b7\nincreasing the maximum number of directors on our Board to more than eleven persons or twelve persons, subject to the terms of the Governance Agreement (the \u201cGovernance Agreement\u201d) entered into in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement.\nThe Securities Purchase Agreement also imposes a number of affirmative and negative covenants on us. As a result, Starboard has the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted for the vote of the holders of our common stock. Starboard and its affiliates are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business, and they may have interests that diverge from, or even conflict with, those of our other stockholders. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nIn addition, the terms of the Governance Agreement grant Starboard certain rights to designate directors to be nominated for election by holders of our common stock. For so long as certain criteria set forth in the Governance Agreement are satisfied, including that Starboard beneficially own, in the aggregate, at least (i) 89,264 shares of Series B Preferred Stock or (ii) the lesser of 5.0% of the Company\u2019s then-outstanding common stock (on an as-converted basis, if applicable) and 1,783,141 shares of issued and outstanding common stock (subject to adjustment for stock splits, reclassifications, combinations and similar adjustments), Starboard has the right to designate two directors for election to our Board, consisting of one nominee who is affiliated with Starboard and one independent nominee.\nThe directors designated by Starboard also are entitled to serve on committees of our Board, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law, the interests of the directors designated by Starboard may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors.\nWe may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance a required repurchase of our Series B Preferred Stock.\nAfter November 6, 2026, each holder of Series B Preferred Stock will have the right, upon 90 days\u2019 notice, to require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of the Series B Preferred Stock for cash at a price equal to $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. In addition, upon certain change of control events, holders of Series B Preferred Stock can require us, subject to certain exceptions, to repurchase any or all of their Series B Preferred Stock.\nIt is possible that we would not have sufficient funds to make any required repurchase of Series B Preferred Stock. Moreover, we may not be able to arrange financing, to pay the repurchase price.\nWe plan to invest proceeds from the sale of Series B Preferred Stock to advance our strategic priorities, and failure to realize the anticipated benefits of these investments could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nWe plan to use approximately half of the proceeds of Starboard\u2019s investment to reduce the outstanding principal amount under our revolving credit facility. The remaining proceeds, combined with the additional borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility as a result of the debt repayment, is expected to provide financial flexibility that enables us to make investments in our business, including investments in our brand, products, technology, human capital and unit\neconomics. However, we may not be able to implement and realize the anticipated benefits from these investments. Events and circumstances, such as financial or unforeseen difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing desired outcomes. Any failure to implement the proceeds from the investment in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email, text messages and postal mailings. Any future restrictions in federal, state or foreign laws regarding marketing and solicitation or domestic or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email, text messages and postal mailing techniques and could force changes in our marketing strategies. If this occurs, we may need to develop alternative marketing strategies, which may not be as effective and could impact the amount and timing of our revenues.\nWe may not be able to execute our strategy or achieve our planned growth targets, which could negatively impact our business and our financial results.\nOur growth strategy depends on our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to open new restaurants and to operate them on a profitable basis. We expect substantially all of our international unit growth and much of our domestic unit growth to be franchised units. Accordingly, our profitability increasingly depends upon royalty revenues from franchisees. If our franchisees are not able to operate their businesses successfully under our franchised business model, our results could suffer. Additionally, we may fail to attract new qualified franchisees or existing franchisees may close underperforming locations. Planned growth targets and the ability to operate new and existing restaurants profitably are affected by economic, regulatory and competitive conditions and consumer buying habits. A decrease in sales, such as what we experienced in 2018, or increased commodity or operating costs, including, but not limited to, employee compensation and benefits or insurance costs, could slow the rate of new store openings or increase the number of store closings. Our business is susceptible to adverse changes in local, national and global economic conditions, which could make it difficult for us to meet our growth targets. Additionally, we or our franchisees may face challenges securing financing, finding suitable store locations at acceptable terms or securing required domestic or foreign government permits and approvals. Declines in comparable sales, net store openings and related operating profits significantly impacted our stock price in 2018. If we do not improve future sales and operating results and meet our related growth targets or external expectations for net restaurant openings or our other strategic objectives in the future, our stock price could continue to decline.\nOur franchisees remain dependent on the availability of financing to remodel or renovate existing locations, upgrade systems and enhance technology, or construct and open new restaurants. From time to time, the Company may provide financing to certain franchisees and prospective franchisees in order to mitigate store closings, allow new units to open, or complete required upgrades. If we are unable or unwilling to provide such financing, which is a function of, among other things, a franchisee\u2019s creditworthiness, the number of new restaurant openings may be slower or the rate of closures may be higher than expected and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. To the extent we provide financing to franchisees, our results could be negatively impacted by negative performance of these franchisee loans.\nWe may be adversely impacted by increases in the cost of food ingredients and other costs.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in commodities. An increase in the cost or sustained high levels of the cost of cheese or other commodities could adversely affect the profitability of our system-wide restaurant operations, particularly if we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to offset increased costs. Cheese, representing our largest food cost, and other commodities can be subject to significant cost fluctuations due to weather, availability, global demand and other factors that are beyond our control. Additionally, increases in labor, mileage, insurance, fuel, and other costs could adversely affect the profitability of our restaurant and QC Center businesses. Most of the factors affecting costs in our system-wide restaurant operations are beyond our control, and we may not be able to adequately mitigate these costs or pass along these costs to our customers or franchisees, given the significant competitive pricing pressures we face.\nOur dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers for some ingredients could result in disruptions to our business.\nDomestic restaurants purchase substantially all food and related products from our QC Centers. We are dependent on Leprino Foods Dairy Products Company (\u201cLeprino\u201d) as our sole supplier for cheese, one of our key ingredients. Leprino, one of the major pizza category suppliers of cheese in the United States, currently supplies all of our cheese domestically and substantially all of our cheese internationally. We also depend on a sole source for our supply of certain desserts, which constitutes less than 10% of our domestic Company-owned restaurant sales. While we have no other sole sources of supply for key ingredients or menu items, we do source other key ingredients from a limited number of suppliers. Alternative sources of cheese, desserts, other key ingredients or menu items may not be available on a timely basis or may not be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current arrangements.\nOur Company-owned and franchised restaurants could also be harmed by a prolonged disruption in the supply of products from or to our QC Centers due to weather, climate change, natural disasters, crop disease, food safety incidents, regulatory compliance, labor dispute or interruption of service by carriers. In particular, adverse weather or crop disease affecting the California tomato crop could disrupt the supply of pizza sauce to our and our franchisees\u2019 restaurants. Insolvency of key suppliers could also cause similar business interruptions and negatively impact our business.\nNatural disasters, hostilities, social unrest and other catastrophic events may disrupt our operations or supply chain.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster, hostilities, epidemic, cyber-attack, social unrest, terrorist activity or other catastrophic events may result in the closure of our restaurants (Company-owned or franchised), our corporate office, any of our QC Centers or the facilities of our suppliers, and can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence levels and supply availability and costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in purchasing practices by our domestic franchisees could harm our commissary business.\nAlthough our domestic franchisees currently purchase substantially all food products from our QC Centers, the only required QC Center purchases by franchisees are pizza sauce, dough and other items we may designate as proprietary or integral to our system. Any changes in purchasing practices by domestic franchisees, such as seeking alternative approved suppliers of ingredients or other food products, could adversely affect the financial results of our QC Centers and the Company.\nOur current insurance may not be adequate and we may experience claims in excess of our reserves.\nOur insurance programs for workers\u2019 compensation, owned and non-owned vehicles, general liability, property and team member health insurance coverage are funded by the Company up to certain retention levels, generally ranging from $100,000 to $1 million. These insurance programs may not be adequate to protect us, and it may be difficult or impossible to obtain additional coverage or maintain current coverage at a reasonable cost. We also have experienced increasing claims volatility and higher related costs for workers\u2019 compensation, owned and non-owned vehicles and health claims. We estimate loss reserves based on historical trends, actuarial assumptions and other data available to us, but we may not be able to accurately estimate reserves. If we experience claims in excess of our projections, our business could be negatively impacted. Our franchisees could be similarly impacted by higher claims experience, hurting both their operating results and/or limiting their ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost.\nOur international operations are subject to increased risks and other factors that may make it more difficult to achieve or maintain profitability or meet planned growth rates.\nOur international operations could be negatively impacted by volatility and instability in international economic, political, security or health conditions in the countries in which the Company or our franchisees operate, especially in emerging markets. In addition, there are risks associated with differing business and social cultures and consumer preferences. We may face limited availability for restaurant locations, higher location costs and difficulties in franchisee selection and financing. We may be subject to difficulties in sourcing and importing high-quality ingredients (and ensuring food safety) in a cost-effective manner, hiring and retaining qualified team members, marketing effectively and adequately investing in information technology, especially in emerging markets.\nOur international operations are also subject to additional risk factors, including import and export controls, compliance with anti-corruption and other foreign laws, difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contract rights in foreign jurisdictions, and the imposition of increased or new tariffs or trade barriers. We intend to continue to expand internationally, which would make the risks related to our international operations more significant over time.\nOur international results, which are now completely franchised, depend heavily on the operating capabilities and financial strength of our franchisees. Any changes in the ability of our franchisees to run their stores profitably in accordance with our operating procedures, or to effectively sub franchise stores, could result in brand damage, a higher number of restaurant closures and a reduction in the number of new restaurant openings.\nSales made by our franchisees in international markets and certain loans we provide to such franchisees are denominated in their local currencies, and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar occur relative to the local currencies. Accordingly, changes in currency exchange rates will cause our revenues, investment income and operating results to fluctuate. We have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Our international revenues and earnings may be adversely impacted as the U.S. dollar rises against foreign currencies because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Additionally, the value of certain assets or loans denominated in local currencies may deteriorate. Other items denominated in U.S. dollars including product imports or loans may also become more expensive, putting pressure on franchisees\u2019 cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). In March 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw, and withdrawal negotiations began in June 2017. European Union rules provide for a two-year negotiation period, ending on March 29, 2019, unless an extension is agreed to by the parties. There remains significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, including the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a negotiated and bilaterally approved withdrawal plan. We have significant operations in both the United Kingdom and the European Union. We depend on the free flow of labor and goods in those regions. The ongoing uncertainty and potential of border controls and customs duties on trade between the United Kingdom and European Union nations could negatively impact our business. The impact of Brexit will depend on the terms of any agreement the United Kingdom and the European Union reach to provide access to markets. As of December 30, 2018, 30.1% of our total international restaurants are in countries within the European Union.\nWe are subject to debt covenant restrictions.\nOur credit agreement, as amended in October 2018, contains affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants. If a covenant violation occurs or is expected to occur, we would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the lenders under the credit agreement. The failure to obtain a waiver or amendment on a timely basis would result in our inability to borrow additional funds or obtain letters of credit under our credit agreement and allow the lenders under our credit agreement to declare our loan obligations due and payable, require us to cash collateralize outstanding letters of credit or increase our interest rate. If any of the foregoing events occur, we would need to refinance our debt, or renegotiate or restructure, the terms of the credit agreement.\nWith our indebtedness, we may have reduced availability of cash flow for other purposes. Increases in interest rates would also increase our debt service costs and could materially impact our profitability as well as the profitability of our franchisees.\nCurrent debt levels under our existing credit facility may reduce available cash flow to plan for or react to business changes, changes in the industry or any general adverse economic conditions. Under our credit facility, we are exposed to variable interest rates. We have entered into interest rate swaps that fix a significant portion of our variable interest rate risk. However, by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we also expose ourselves to credit risk. Credit risk is due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.\nHigher inflation, and a related increase in costs, including rising interest rates, could also impact our franchisees and their ability to open new restaurants or operate existing restaurants profitably.\nIncreasingly complex laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in an increasingly complex regulatory environment, and the cost of regulatory compliance is increasing. Our failure, or the failure of any of our franchisees, to comply with applicable U.S. and international labor, health care, food, health and safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery and corruption, competition, environmental and other laws may result in civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties. Enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements, and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Increased regulatory scrutiny of food matters and product marketing claims, and increased litigation and enforcement actions may increase compliance and legal costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business. For example, some local government agencies have implemented ordinances that restrict the sale of certain food or drink products.\nCompliance with new or additional domestic and international government laws or regulations, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018 could increase costs for compliance. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and costs. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to reputational damage and significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in various jurisdictions. For example, a failure to comply with the GDPR could result in fines up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual global revenues.\nHigher labor costs and increased competition for qualified team members increase the cost of doing business and ensuring adequate staffing in our restaurants. Additionally, changes in employment and labor laws, including health care legislation and minimum wage increases, could increase costs for our system-wide operations.\nOur success depends in part on our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to recruit, motivate and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in Company-owned and franchised restaurants have had a negative impact on our Company-owned restaurant margins and the margins of franchised restaurants. Competition for qualified drivers also continues to increase as more companies compete for drivers or enter the delivery space, including third party aggregators. Additionally, economic actions, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers whose performance may have a material impact on our results. Social media may be used to foster negative perceptions of employment with our Company in particular or in our industry generally, and to promote strikes or boycotts.\nWe are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime compensation, benefits, working conditions, citizenship requirements and discrimination and family and medical leave. Labor costs and labor-related benefits are primary components in the cost of operation of our restaurants and QC Centers. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could increase our system-wide labor costs.\nA significant number of hourly personnel are paid at rates close to the federal and state minimum wage requirements. Accordingly, the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases above federal wage rates or regulations related to exempt employees has increased and could continue to increase labor costs for our domestic system-wide operations.\nThe Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees in the United States or pay penalties for not providing coverage. We, like other industry competitors, are complying with the law and are providing more extensive health benefits to employees than we had previously provided, and are subsidizing a larger portion of their insurance premiums. These additional costs, or costs related to future healthcare regulation, could negatively impact our operational results. In addition, our franchisees subject to the ACA or future healthcare legislation could face additional cost pressures from compliance with the legislation, which could reduce their future expansion of units.\nWe depend on the continued service and availability of key management personnel, and failure to successfully execute succession planning and attract talented team members could harm our Company and brand.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company appointed Steve Richie to serve as Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Mr. Schnatter in that role. In addition to the Chief Executive Officer succession at the beginning of 2018, we executed a significant management reorganization in the fall of 2018 to drive the future growth of the Company. If the new management team is not successful in executing our strategy, our operating results and prospects for future growth may be adversely impacted. Failure to effectively identify, develop and retain other key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions could also disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.\nThe concentration of stock ownership with Mr. Schnatter may influence the outcome of certain matters requiring stockholder approval.\nThe concentration of stock ownership by Mr. Schnatter allows him to substantially influence the outcome of certain matters requiring stockholder approval. Mr. Schnatter\u2019s beneficial ownership is approximately 31% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, he may be able to substantially influence the strategic direction of the Company and the outcome of matters requiring approval by our stockholders, and the interests of Mr. Schnatter may differ from the interests of our stockholders as a whole.\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to invest in or adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including digital ordering solutions, through which over half of our domestic sales originate. We also rely heavily on point-of-sale processing in our Company-owned and franchised restaurants for data collection and payment systems for the collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions, and other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends on the reliability and capacity of these technology systems. In addition, we anticipate that consumers will continue to have more options to place orders digitally, both domestically and internationally. We plan to invest some of the proceeds from Starboard\u2019s investment into enhancing and improving the functionality and features of our information technology systems. However, we cannot ensure that this initiative will be beneficial to the extent, or within the timeframes, expected or that the estimated improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. Our failure to adequately invest in new technology, adapt to technological developments and industry trends, particularly our digital ordering capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share. Notwithstanding adequate investment in new technology, our marketing and technology initiatives may not be successful in improving our comparable sales results. Additionally, we are in an environment where the technology life cycle is short and consumer technology demands are high, which requires continued reinvestment in technology which will increase the cost of doing business and will increase the risk that our technology may not be customer centric or could become obsolete, inefficient or otherwise incompatible with other systems.\nWe rely on our international franchisees to maintain their own point-of-sale and online ordering systems, which are often purchased from third-party vendors, potentially exposing international franchisees to more operational risk, including cyber and data privacy risks and governmental regulation compliance risks.\nDisruptions of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to compete and conduct our business.\nOur critical business and information technology systems could be damaged or interrupted by power loss, various technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks, sabotage or acts of God. In particular, the Company and our franchisees may experience occasional interruptions of our digital ordering solutions, which make online ordering unavailable or slow to respond, negatively impacting sales and the experience of our customers. If our digital ordering solutions do not perform with adequate speed and security, our customers may be less inclined to return to our digital ordering solutions.\nPart of our technology infrastructure, such as our domestic FOCUS point-of-sale system, is specifically designed for us and our operational systems, which could cause unexpected costs, delays or inefficiencies when infrastructure upgrades are needed or prolonged and widespread technological difficulties occur. Significant portions of our technology infrastructure, particularly in our digital ordering solutions, are provided by third parties, and the performance of these systems is largely beyond our control. Failure of our third-party systems and backup systems to adequately perform, particularly as our online sales grow, could harm our business and the satisfaction of our customers. Such third-party systems could be disrupted either through system failure or if third party vendor patents and contractual agreements do not afford us protection against similar technology. In addition, we may not have or be able to obtain adequate protection or insurance to mitigate the risks of these events or compensate for losses related to these events, which could damage our business and reputation and be expensive and difficult to remedy or repair.\nWe rely on third parties for certain business processes and services, and failure or inability of such third-party vendors to perform subjects us to risks, including business disruption and increased costs.\nWe depend on suppliers and other third parties to operate our business. Some third-party business processes we utilize include information technology, gift card authorization and processing, other payment processing, benefits, and other accounting and business services. We conduct third-party due diligence and seek to obtain contractual assurance that our vendors will maintain adequate controls, such as adequate security against data breaches. However, the failure of our suppliers to maintain adequate controls or comply with our expectations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in damage to our reputation, loss of sales, and/or subject us to litigation, penalties or significant costs.\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card data and other personally identifiable information of our employees and customers housed in the various information systems we use. Constantly changing information security threats, particularly persistent cyber security threats, pose risks to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and the availability and integrity of our critical business functions. As techniques used in cyber-attacks evolve, we may not be able to timely detect threats or anticipate and implement adequate security measures. The integrity and protection of the customer, employee, franchisee and Company data are critical to us. Our information technology systems and databases, and those provided by our third-party vendors, including international vendors, have been and will continue to be subject to computer viruses, malware attacks, unauthorized user attempts, phishing and denial of service and other malicious cyber-attacks. The failure to prevent fraud or security breaches or to adequately invest in data security could harm our business and revenues due to the reputational damage to our brand. Such a breach could also result in litigation, regulatory actions, penalties, and other significant costs to us and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. These costs could be significant and well in excess of our cyber insurance coverage.\nWe have been and will continue to be subject to various types of investigations and litigation, including collective and class action litigation, which could subject us to significant damages or other remedies.\nWe are subject to the risk of investigations and litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, franchisees, state and federal agencies, stockholders and employees. From time to time, we are involved in a number of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings consisting of securities, intellectual property, employment, consumer, personal injury, corporate governance, commercial and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.\nWe have been subject to claims in cases containing collective and class action allegations. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. Litigation trends involving the relationship between franchisors and franchisees, personal injury claims, employment law and intellectual property may increase our cost of doing business. We evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the amount of potential losses to us. In many cases, particularly collective and class action cases, we may not be able to estimate the amount of potential losses and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient. These\nassessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of judgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact earnings. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.\nWe may be subject to harassment or discrimination claims and legal proceedings. Although our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct policies prohibit harassment and discrimination in the workplace, in sexual or in any other form, we have ongoing programs for workplace training and compliance, and we investigate and take disciplinary action with respect to alleged violations, actions by our team members could violate those policies. Franchisees and suppliers are also required to comply with all applicable laws and govern themselves with integrity. Any violations (or perceptions thereof) by our franchisees or suppliers could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business and create reputational or other harm to the Company.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on the Papa John\u2019s brand name and rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property rights to protect and promote our brand. We believe the success of our business depends on our continued ability to exclusively use our existing marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand, both domestically and abroad. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and we may be required to pursue litigation to prevent consumer confusion and preserve our brand\u2019s high-quality reputation. Litigation could result in high costs and diversion of resources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, regardless of the outcome.\nWe may be subject to impairment charges.\nImpairment charges are possible due to the nature and timing of decisions we make about underperforming assets or markets, or if previously opened or acquired restaurants perform below our expectations. This could result in a decrease in our reported asset value and reduction in our net income.\nWe operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results.\nWe operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. We have international operations and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions. The domestic and international tax environments continue to evolve as a result of tax changes in various jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the tax laws in certain countries, including the United States, could impact our future net income.", "PERMNO": 79299, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "PZZA"}
