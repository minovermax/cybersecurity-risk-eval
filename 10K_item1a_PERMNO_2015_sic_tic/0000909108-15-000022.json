{"cik": "909108", "company": "DIAMOND HILL INVESTMENT GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and the market price of our common shares are subject to various risks, including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time-to-time in our other periodic filings with the SEC. Investors should carefully consider these risks, along with the other information contained in this report, before making an investment decision regarding our common shares. There may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider immaterial. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and value of our common shares. Please see \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d within Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K.\nPoor investment results of our products could affect our ability to attract new clients or reduce the amount of assets under management, potentially negatively impacting revenue and net income.\nIf we fail to deliver acceptable investment results for our clients, both in the short and long term, we will likely experience diminished investor interest and potentially a diminished level of AUM.\nAdverse opinions of the funds we administer or advise published by third parties, including rating agencies and industry analysts, could decrease our AUM and our revenues.\nInvestment funds are assessed and rated by independent third parties, including rating agencies, industry analysts and publications. Investors can be influenced by such ratings. If any of the funds we administer or advise receives an adverse report, it could negatively influence the amount of money invested into the fund and increase withdrawals from the fund reducing our AUM and our revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on our key personnel, and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services.\nOur success depends on highly skilled personnel, including portfolio managers, research analysts, and management, many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in the investment management industry. Financial services professionals are in high demand, and we face significant competition for qualified employees. With the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment at any time. The Company cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel. In order to retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. The loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and clients. A loss of client assets resulting from the departure of key personnel may materially decrease our revenues and net income.\nThe Company's AUM, which impacts revenue, is subject to significant fluctuations.\nA large majority of our revenue is calculated as a percentage of AUM or is related to the general performance of the equity securities market. A decline in securities prices (such as that experienced during the last half of 2008 and first quarter of 2009) or in the sale of investment products, or an increase in fund redemptions, generally would reduce fee income. Financial market declines would generally negatively impact the level of our AUM and consequently our revenue and net income. A recession or other economic or political events, both in the United States as well as globally, could also adversely impact our revenue, if such events led to a decreased demand for products, a higher redemption rate, or a decline in securities prices.\nThe investment results and/or the growth in our AUM may be constrained if appropriate investment opportunities are not available or if we close certain of our portfolios.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to deliver strong investment results depends in large part on our ability to identify appropriate investment opportunities in which to invest client assets. If we are unable to identify sufficient investment opportunities for existing and new client assets on a timely basis, our investment results could be adversely affected. The risk that appropriate investment opportunities may be unavailable is influenced by a number of factors, including general market conditions, and is likely to increase if our AUM increases rapidly. In addition, if we determine that sufficient investment opportunities are not available for a portfolio strategy, or we believe that in order to continue to produce attractive returns from a portfolio, we will consider closing the portfolio to new investors. If we misjudge the point at which it would be optimal to close a portfolio, the investment results of the portfolio could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company is subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business.\nOur investment products compete against a number of investment products and services from:\n\u2022\nasset management firms;\n\u2022\nmutual fund companies;\n\u2022\ncommercial banks and thrift institutions;\n\u2022\ninsurance companies;\n\u2022\nexchange traded funds;\n\u2022\nhedge funds; and\n\u2022\nbrokerage and investment banking firms.\nMany of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than the Company and may operate in more markets or offer a broader range of products, including passively managed or \u201cindex\u201d products. Some of these institutions operate in a different regulatory environment, which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer. We compete with other providers of investment services primarily based upon our philosophy, performance and client service. Some institutions have a broad array of products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them. If current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors, we could face a significant decline in market share, AUM, revenues, and net income. If we are required to lower our fees in order to remain competitive, our net income could be significantly reduced because some of our expenses are fixed, especially over shorter periods of time, and other expenses may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues.\nThe loss of access to or increased fees required by third party distribution sources to market our portfolios and access our client base could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract additional assets to manage is dependent on our access to third-party intermediaries. We gain access to mutual fund investors and some retail and institutional clients through third parties, including mutual fund platforms and financial intermediaries. We compensate intermediaries for access to investors and for various services provided. These distribution sources and client bases may not continue to be accessible to us for reasonable terms, or at all. Limiting or the total absence of such access could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The recent economic downturn and consolidation in the broker-dealer industry may lead to reduced distribution access and increases in fees the Company is required to pay to intermediaries. If such increased fees should be required, refusal to pay them could restrict our access to those client bases while paying them could adversely affect our profitability.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues are based on contracts with the Funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice.\nThe Company is very dependent on our contractual relationships with the Funds. In the event our advisory or administration agreements with the Funds are terminated, not renewed, or amended to reduce fees, we would be materially and adversely affected. Generally, these agreements are terminable by either party upon 60 days written notice without penalty. The agreements are subject to annual approval by either (i) the board of trustees of the Funds or (ii) a vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities of each Fund. The agreements automatically terminate in the event of their assignment by either the Company or the Fund. We generated approximately 73%, 71%, and 65% of our 2014, 2013 and 2012 revenues, respectively, from our advisory and administrative contracts with the Funds, including 30%, 15%, and 10% from the advisory contracts with the Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund, Large Cap Fund, and Small Cap Fund, respectively, during 2014. The loss of the Long-Short Fund, Large Cap Fund, or Small Cap Fund contracts would have a material adverse effect on the Company. We consider our relationship with the Funds and their board of trustees to be good, and we have no reason to believe that these advisory or administration contracts will not be renewed in the future; however, there is no assurance that the Funds will choose to continue their relationships with us.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in losses or limit our growth.\nThe Company is dependent on the capacity and reliability of the communications, information and technology systems supporting our operations, whether developed, owned and operated by the Company or by third parties. Operational risks such as trading or operational errors, interruption of our financial, accounting, trading, compliance and other data processing systems, the loss of data contained in the systems, or compromised systems due to cyber-attack, could result in a disruption of our business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage, and thus adversely affect our business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to substantial governmental regulation.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal securities laws, including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the U.S. PATRIOT Act of 2001. In addition, we are subject to significant regulation and oversight by the SEC and FINRA. Changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements could have a significant effect on our operations and results, including but not limited to increased expenses and reduced investor interest in certain funds and other investment products we offer. We continually monitors legislative, tax, regulatory, accounting, and compliance developments that could impact our business. We and our directors, officers and employees could be subject to lawsuits or regulatory proceedings for violations of such laws and regulations, which could result in the payment of fines or penalties and cause reputational harm to the Company. Such harm could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as divert management's attention from operations.\nWe continue to seek to understand, evaluate and, when possible, manage and control these and other business risks.\nTrading in our common shares is limited, which may adversely affect the time and the price at which you can sell your shares of the Company.\nAlthough our common shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the shares are held by a relatively small number of shareholders, and trading in our common shares is not active. The spread between the bid and the asked prices is often wide. As a result, you may not be able to sell your shares on short notice, and the sale of a large number of shares at one time could temporarily depress the market price. In addition, certain shareholders, including certain directors and officers of the Company, own a significant number of shares. The sale of a large number of shares by any such individual could temporarily depress the market price.", "PERMNO": 86818, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "DHIL"}
