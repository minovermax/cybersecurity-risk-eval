{"cik": "944508", "company": "INVENTURE FOODS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our Common Stock. You should read and carefully consider these risk factors, and the entirety of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before you invest in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe expect some of our future growth to be derived in part from acquisitions, but our acquisition strategy may not be successful, or we may not be successful integrating acquisitions.\nAn element of our business strategy is the pursuit of selected strategic acquisition opportunities for the purpose of expanding, complementing and/or diversifying our business. We may not be able to identify, finance and complete strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms. Any future acquisitions could divert management\u2019s attention from our daily operations and otherwise require additional management, operational and financial resources. Moreover, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies or their management teams into our operating structure, retain management teams of acquired companies on a long-term basis, or operate acquired companies profitably. Acquisitions may also involve a number of other risks, including adverse short-term effects on our operating results, dependence on retaining key personnel and customers, and risks associated with unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate could limit our business activities, increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.\nThe conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, health and safety practices, transportation and use of many of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products are made, manufactured or sold. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertising and marketing practices; laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products; laws and programs restricting the sale and advertising of certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients present in certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our products; increased\nregulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving, product claims and concerns regarding the effects on health of ingredients in, or attributes of, certain of our products; state consumer protection laws; taxation requirements, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other limitations on the sale of our products; competition laws; anti-corruption laws; employment laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; and environmental laws. New laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes or other limitations on the sale of our products, ingredients contained in our products or commodities used in the production of our products, may alter the environment in which we do business and, therefore, may impact our operating results or increase our costs or liabilities.\nOur operations and financial conditions may be impacted by general economic conditions and an economic downturn.\nRecessionary pressures from an overall decline in U.S. economic activity could adversely impact our results of operations. Economic uncertainty may reduce consumer spending and could result in increased pressure from competitors or customers to reduce the prices of our products and/or limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Instability in the financial markets may impact our ability or increase the cost to enter into new credit agreements in the future. Additionally, it may weaken the ability of customers, suppliers, distributors, banks, insurance companies and other business partners to perform in the normal course of business, which could expose us to losses or disrupt supply of inputs used to conduct our business. If one or more key business partners fail to perform as expected or contracted, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nWe may incur significant future expenses in connection with the implementation of our business strategy.\nWe strive to achieve our long-term vision of being a leading marketer and manufacturer of healthy/natural and indulgent specialty snack food brands. Our efforts are subject to the substantial risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the implementation of a business strategy. If we are unsuccessful in developing, acquiring and/or licensing new brands, and increasing distribution and sales volume of our existing products, our operating results could be negatively impacted. Even if we are successful, this business strategy may require us to incur substantial additional expenses, including advertising and promotional costs, \u201cslotting\u201d expenses (i.e., the cost of obtaining shelf or freezer space in certain grocery stores), and integration costs of any future acquisitions. We also may be unsuccessful at integrating any future acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to obtain the additional financing we need to implement our business strategy.\nA significant element of our business strategy is the development, acquisition and/or licensing of innovative specialty food brands, for the purpose of expanding, complementing and/or diversifying our business. In connection with our previous acquisitions, we borrowed funds or assumed additional indebtedness in order to satisfy a substantial portion of the consideration required to be paid by us. We may, in the future, require additional third-party financing (debt or equity) as a result of any future operating losses, in connection with the expansion of our business through non-acquisition means, in connection with any additional acquisitions completed by us, or to provide working capital for general corporate purposes. Third-party financing may not be available when required or, if available, may not be on terms attractive to us. Any third-party financing obtained by us may result in dilution of the equity interests of our stockholders.\nWe are required to maintain certain ongoing financial covenants under our credit facility, and if we fail to meet those covenants or otherwise suffer a default thereunder, our lender may accelerate the payment of such indebtedness.\nAt December 27, 2014, we had outstanding indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of $85.1 million.\nOur credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders led by U.S. Bank National Association (\u201cU.S. Bank\u201d) is secured by substantially all of our assets. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our subsidiaries. We are required to comply with certain financial covenants pursuant to the Credit Agreement so long as borrowings from U.S. Bank remain outstanding. Should we be in default under any of such covenants, U.S. Bank has the right, upon written notice and after the expiration of any applicable period during which such default may be cured, to demand immediate payment of all of the then unpaid principal and accrued but unpaid interest under the Credit Agreement. At December 27, 2014, we were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement.\nAs we execute our business strategy, we may not be able to remain in compliance with our financial covenants. Any acceleration of the borrowings under the Credit Agreement prior to the applicable maturity dates could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe may incur losses and costs as a result of any product recalls we are required to make or product liability claims that may be brought against us.\nWe may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled. We may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury. Such injury could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties; product contamination (such as listeria, e-coli, and salmonella) or spoilage; the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, and other agents; residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases; or improperly formulated products. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. The product liability and product recall insurance maintained by us may not be adequate to cover any loss or exposure for product liability, and such insurance may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. Any product liability claim not fully covered by insurance, as well as any adverse publicity resulting from a product liability claim or product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, and could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products. In addition, our results could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products, ingredients or packaging, even in the absence of a recall or a product liability case.\nConcerns with the safety and quality of our food products or ingredients could negatively impact our brand image and profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our products or ingredients. Our success also depends on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build up brand image for new products and brand extensions, and maintain our corporate reputation. We cannot assure you, however, that our commitment to product safety and quality and our continuing investment in advertising and marketing will have the desired impact on our products\u2019 brand image and on consumer preferences. Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. Allegations of product safety or quality issues or contamination, even if untrue, may require us from time to time to recall a product from all of the markets in which the affected production was distributed. Such issues or recalls could negatively affect our profitability and brand image.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from one product and one customer.\nIn 2014, 20% of our net revenues were attributable to Rader Farms\u00ae/Kirkland\u00ae co-branded frozen berry product sales to Costco. Overall, Costco accounted for 26% of our 2014 net revenues. Taking into account our Willamette Valley Fruit Company and Fresh Frozen Foods acquisitions, Costco accounted for 27% of consolidated 2013 pro forma net revenues (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). A decision by Costco to no longer carry certain frozen berry products could have a material adverse inpact on our Frozen business. A decision by any major customer to cease or substantially reduce its purchases, or a decrease in the popularity of frozen berries during any year, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, and such decision by Costco would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a license agreement for the right to sell our T.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u00ae brand.\nFor the year ended December 27, 2014, 12% of our net revenues were attributable to the T.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u00ae brand products, which are manufactured and sold by us under our license agreement with T.G.I. Friday\u2019s that expires in December 2019. The license agreement imposes certain requirements and conditions on us (including, without limitation, minimum sales targets). Our failure to comply with these requirements and conditions could result in the early termination of the license agreement by T.G.I. Friday\u2019s. If we are unsuccessful in negotiating an extension of this license agreement, or the license agreement is not renewed at the expiration of its term or is terminated prior thereto, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by oversupply of snack and frozen products at the wholesale and retail levels and seasonal fluctuations.\nProfitability in the food product industry is subject to oversupply of certain snack and frozen products at the wholesale and retail levels, which can result in our products going out of date before they are sold. The snack and frozen products industry is also seasonal. Consumers tend to purchase our snack products at higher levels during the major summer holidays and also at times surrounding the major sporting events throughout the year. Our industrial berry business at Willamette Valley Fruit Company is generally slower during the first quarter of the year. Additionally, we may face seasonal price increases for raw materials. Such seasonal costs could materially and adversely affect our operating results in any given quarter.\nWe may incur substantial costs in order to market our products.\nSuccessful marketing of our products generally depends upon obtaining adequate retail shelf space for product display, particularly in supermarkets. Frequently, food manufacturers and distributors such as us, incur additional costs in order to obtain additional shelf space. Whether or not we incur such costs in a particular market is dependent upon a number of factors, including demand for our products, relative availability of shelf space and general competitive conditions. We may incur significant shelf space or other promotional costs as a necessary condition of entering into competition or maintaining market share in particular markets or stores. If incurred, such costs may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may not be able to respond successfully to shifting consumer preferences.\nConsumer preferences evolve over time and are extremely difficult to predict. Our success depends in part on our ability to timely respond to current market trends and anticipate changing consumer tastes and dietary habits and to develop and license new products that appeal to such preferences, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by increased attention to nutritional values, such as the sodium, fat, protein, or calorie content of different products, or concerns regarding the health effects of specific ingredients, such as gluten, soybeans, nuts, and oils. If consumer demand for our products declines, our sales volumes and our business could be negatively affected.\nThe loss of certain key employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success is dependent in large part upon the abilities of our executive officers, including Terry McDaniel, Chief Executive Officer, and Steve Weinberger, Chief Financial Officer. Implementation of our business strategy will challenge our executive officers, and the inability of such officers to perform their duties or our inability to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our strategy to expand our business internationally.\nWe plan to expand sales to Canadian customers and are exploring other international market opportunities for our brands. Such expansion may require significant management attention and financial resources and may not produce desired levels of revenue. International business is subject to inherent risks, including longer accounts receivable collection cycles, difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographical areas, difficulties enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights, fluctuations in local economic, market and political conditions, compliance requirements with U.S. and foreign export regulations, potential adverse tax consequences and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may impact our ability to remain competitive in international markets.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or breach of security of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nWe rely on information systems across our operations, including for management, sales, and order processing. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the sales and delivery of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. Like other companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks,\ntelecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of cyber-attack, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or our customers. This could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, or the improper use of personal information or other \u201cidentity theft.\u201d Each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in customer service, reduce efficiency in our operations, require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, or result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation and results.\nRisks Related to the Frozen Products Segment\nFarming is subject to numerous inherent risks including changes in weather conditions or natural disasters that can have an adverse impact on crop production and materially affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risks that generally relate to the agricultural industry. Adverse changes in weather conditions and natural disasters, such as windstorms, floods, earthquakes, droughts, extreme temperatures or pestilence, may affect the crop quality and size. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Fresh berries and vegetables are also vulnerable to crop disease and to pests, which may vary in severity and effect, depending on the stage of production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied and climatic conditions. Moreover, there can be no assurance that available technologies to control such infestations will continue to be effective. These infestations can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our competitors may be affected differently by such weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies or operations.\nUnavailability of purchased berries and vegetables, at reasonable prices, could adversely affect operations.\nOur manufacturing costs are subject to fluctuations in certain commodity prices. Berries and vegetables are not readily available year-round. Therefore, we use the IQF technique to freeze the berries and vegetables harvested for use during the year to meet processing demands. In addition to freezing our own home-grown berries, we also purchase a substantial amount of berries from outside suppliers to meet customer demands. We are dependent on our suppliers to provide us with an adequate supply of vegetables and berries on a timely basis. The failure of certain suppliers to meet our performance specifications, quality standards or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. To the extent that certain types of berries or vegetables become scarce, substantially increase in price, or become unavailable or unavailable on commercially attractive terms, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Snack Product Segment\nWe may not be able to compete successfully in the highly competitive snack food industry.\nThe market for snack foods, such as those sold by us, is large and intensely competitive. Competitive factors in the snack food industry include product quality and taste, brand awareness among consumers, access to supermarket shelf space, price, advertising and promotion, variety of snacks offered, nutritional content, product packaging and package design. We compete in that market principally on the basis of product taste and quality.\nThe snack food industry is dominated by large food companies, including Frito-Lay, Inc., a subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc., The Kellogg Company, ConAgra Foods, Inc., Diamond Foods, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Snyder\u2019s-Lance, Inc. and others which have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and sell brands that are more widely recognized than our products. Numerous other companies that are actual or potential competitors of ours, many with greater financial and other resources (including more employees and more extensive facilities) than us, offer products similar to ours. In addition, many of our competitors offer a wider range of products than that offered by us. Local or regional markets often have a significant number of smaller competitors, many of whom offer products similar to ours. With the expansion of our operations into new markets, we have and will continue to encounter significant competition from national, regional and local competitors that may be greater than that encountered by us in our existing markets. In addition, such competitors may challenge our position in our existing markets.\nA disruption in the performance of our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nOur manufacturing costs are subject to fluctuations in the prices of potatoes, potato flakes, potato starch, corn and oil, as well as other ingredients used in our products. Potatoes, potato flakes, potato starch and corn are widely available year-round, and we use a variety of oils in the production of our products. Nonetheless, we are dependent on our suppliers to provide us with products and ingredients in adequate supply and on a timely basis. The failure of certain suppliers to meet our performance specifications, quality standards or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Changing suppliers can require long lead times. The failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons, including fires, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, crop failure, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political instability and terrorism. A failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers\u2019 financial difficulties, including bankruptcy. Any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance. To the extent that product ingredients become scarce, substantially increase in price, or become unavailable or unavailable on commercially attractive terms, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. From time to time, we may lock in prices for raw materials, such as oils, as we deem appropriate, and such strategies may result in us paying prices for raw materials that are above market at the time of purchase.\nWe do not own the patents for the technology we use to manufacture certain T.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u00ae, Boulder Canyon\u00ae and Tato Skins\u00ae brand products, as well as certain private label branded products.\nWe license technology from a third party in connection with the manufacture of certain T.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u00ae, Boulder Canyon\u00ae and Tato Skins\u00ae brand products, as well as certain private label branded products, and have a royalty-bearing, exclusive right license to use the technology necessary to produce these products in the United States, Canada, and Mexico until such time as the parties mutually agree to terminate the agreement. Even though the patents for this technology expired in December 2006, in consideration for the use of this technology, we are required to make royalty payments to the third party on sales of products manufactured utilizing the technology until the termination of such license agreement. Since these patents have expired, we no longer have exclusive rights to this technology and, as a result, may face additional competition that could adversely affect our revenues. Moreover, our competitors, some of which may have significantly greater resources than us, may utilize different technology in the manufacture of products that are similar to those we currently manufacture, or that we may manufacture in the future. The entry of any such products into the marketplace could have a material adverse effect on our sales of certain T.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u00ae, Boulder Canyon\u00ae and Tato Skins\u00ae brand products, certain private label branded products, as well as any such future products.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to protect our rights to trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property we own or license. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our services or our use of intellectual property infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. A successful claim of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property infringement against us could prevent us from providing services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a breakdown in our internal policies and procedures may lead to an unintentional disclosure of our proprietary, confidential or material non-public information, which could in turn harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nSubstantial sales of our common stock by our stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating results.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through offerings of our common stock. As of December 27, 2014, we had 19,592,651 shares of our common stock outstanding. In addition, as of December 27, 2014, there were outstanding options to purchase 732,852 shares of our common stock and 353,529 shares of common stock issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units. Substantially all of our outstanding common stock is\neligible for sale, subject to Rule 144 volume limitations for holders affected by such limitations, as are shares of our common stock issuable under vested and exercisable options. If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and may decline regardless of our financial performance.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u00b7 announcements relating to our industry or to our own business or prospects;\n\u00b7 the failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u00b7 changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other public companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u00b7 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the global economy;\n\u00b7 our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u00b7 future sales of common stock or the perception that sales could occur;\n\u00b7 failure of suppliers to meet expectations;\n\u00b7 the unavailability of berries or vegetables at attractive prices;\n\u00b7 any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u00b7 developments relating to litigation, governmental investigation, the legal and regulatory environment, product recalls or changes in competitive conditions; and\n\u00b7 other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, changes in weather conditions or natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of publicly traded companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company. If securities class action litigation is instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our amended certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, preventing or rendering more difficult an acquisition of us if such acquisition is deemed undesirable by our board of directors, including provisions that:\n\u00b7 authorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by the board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u00b7 restrict our ability to engage in transactions with stockholders with 15% or more of outstanding voting stock; and\n\u00b7 limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent unsolicited takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. Any provision of our amended certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, or if our operating or financial results do not meet expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets. In addition, if our operating or financial results do not meet analysts\u2019 expectations, our stock price or trading volume could decline. Any of these factors could cause you to lose part or all of you investment in our common stock.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, certain debt agreements of ours limit our ability to declare and pay cash dividends, and any future financing agreements may prohibit us from paying any type of dividends. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 84325, "SIC": 2030, "TIC": "SNAK"}
