We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nRisks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and future adverse impacts could be material and difficult to predict.\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption. The pandemic and related government actions (including declared states of emergency and quarantine, \u201cshelter in place\u201d or similar lockdown orders), non-governmental agency recommendations, and actions of businesses and individuals, as well as perceptions surrounding public health and safety, have resulted and are expected to continue to result in weakened economic conditions and significant economic uncertainty and volatility. These have significantly adversely affected our business, operations and financial results and we expect this will continue.\nWe are continuing to monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict the extent to which it will continue to impact our business, operations and financial results, which may depend on numerous factors. These include the occurrence of new outbreaks; the rate of vaccination administration; how quickly normal economic activity will resume; the effect on our clients and client demand for our services, including closure of client facilities and clients\u2019 ability to pay for our services and solutions; increases or decreases to government restrictions and the pace at which they occur; the economic impact and adequacy of government-sponsored relief programs; and the increased risk of more infections as social interaction increases. As a result, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate effects, which could be material, of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results.\nAny of the effects resulting from COVID-19 could also cause, contribute to or magnify the other risks and uncertainties described below.\nCompany and Operational Risks\nOur results of operations have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in global macroeconomic conditions. Even before the onset of the pandemic, we have at times experienced uncertainty and volatility in global economic conditions, including in rates of growth or decline in the markets we serve. Most of our operating countries and regions, which are increasingly interdependent, have experienced volatile growth patterns or declines, and we expect that global conditions will continue to be characterized by instability and unpredictability. Such conditions may cause our clients to reduce or to continue to defer their spending on new projects that require our solutions which could decrease demand for our various staffing services. Even if there is a recovery from COVID-related economic declines, there can be no assurances when or how rapidly this would occur and in what regions, and whether growth rates would return to pre-pandemic levels. If growth remains slow, as a result of the pandemic or otherwise, or if it continues to contract for an extended period of time, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur profitability is sensitive to decreases in demand. In 2020, we experienced a decrease in demand and our operating profit was impacted unfavorably as we experienced a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses did not decline as quickly as revenues. In periods of decline, we may not be able to reduce selling and administrative expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. Additionally, some clients have slowed the rate at which they pay us, or have become unable to pay their obligations and there is risk that this could continue, and our cash flow and profitability may suffer.\nEconomic conditions in the countries and territories where we do business may be affected by recent or emerging events, such as the rise of populism, political volatility, civil violence and unrest, election results or other changes in ruling parties or governmental leadership, trade disputes, protectionism or changes in global trade policies, the global refugee crisis, social justice movements, global health crises, changes in immigration policy, changes in employment policy, rising interest rates, the impact of terrorist activity, or by other political or economic developments. We are particularly susceptible to changes in demand patterns and economic conditions in Europe, which represents two of our operating segments and 66% of our revenue.\nThere is a risk that economic conditions in European markets may continue to be negatively impacted by events in recent years which, in addition to COVID-19, have included labor unrest, civil protest, heightened trade tensions, and uncertainty around the impacts of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Any of these events or trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nThere is a risk that even when overall global economic conditions are positive, we could experience declines in all, or in portions, of our business. During past periods of recovery, we have experienced inconsistent results, with some geographical regions, or countries within a region, suffering declines or weakness in economic activity while others improve. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth or contraction may affect demand for our solutions and services, and there is a risk that, even during times of strengthening global economic conditions, we may not experience uniform, or any, increases in demand for our solutions and services within the markets where our business is concentrated.\nEven without uncertainty and volatility, it is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of economic cycles, and the short-term nature of many of our staffing assignments. When it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand, we may not be able to determine the optimal level of personnel and office investments necessary to profitably operate our business or take advantage of growth opportunities.\nWe may lack the speed and agility to respond to the needs of our clients.\nThere is a risk we may not be able to respond with sufficient speed and agility to the needs of our diverse clients, which span all industries and whose needs may change rapidly as their businesses and industries evolve. The size and breadth of our organization, comprising approximately 25,000 employees based out of over 2,200 offices in 75 countries and territories, may make it difficult for us to effectively manage our resources to drive service improvements and to provide coordinated solutions to our clients who require our services in multiple locations. For example, client demands for uniform service across borders may be difficult to satisfy because of variation in local laws and customs. We see a trend in more multi-country and enterprise-level relationships, and we may have difficulty in profitably managing and delivering projects involving multiple countries. Also, our size and organizational structure may make it difficult to develop and implement new processes and tools across the enterprise in a consistent manner. If we are not effective at anticipating or meeting the widely ranging needs of our current and prospective clients, or our competitors are more agile or effective at doing so, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.\nThe worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, and in recent years has undergone significant consolidation. We compete in markets throughout the world with full-service and specialized employment services agencies. Several of our global competitors, including The Adecco Group and Randstad, have very substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain markets. Portions of our industry may become increasingly commoditized, with the result that competition in key areas could become more focused on pricing. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients. There is a risk that we will not compete effectively, including on price, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share and could materially adversely affect our financial results. This may worsen as clients increasingly take advantage of low-cost alternatives including using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party.\nWe could incur liabilities or suffer reputational damage from a cyberattack or improper disclosure or loss of personal or confidential data, and our use of data is subject to complex and ever-changing privacy and cybersecurity legal requirements that could negatively impact our business or subject us to claims and/or fines for non-compliance.\nIn connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment data, about our employees, clients, associates and candidates, a portion of which is personal data and/or confidential data. We expect our use of data to increase, including through the use of analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In engaging in these data-related activities, we rely on our own technology and systems, and those of third-party vendors we use for a variety of processes, including cloud-based technology and systems, mobile technologies and social media. Unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, use or loss of personal data and/or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence or malfeasance, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees, vendors or third parties, including a cyberattack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy social engineering attacks, viruses, ransomware, worms or other malicious software programs, or obtain credentials to our systems through other unrelated cyberattacks.\nAn incident involving disclosure, system failure, data modification, loss or security breach could harm our reputation and subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution, as well as liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal and/or confidential data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in\nfrequency and sophistication, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems and other fraudulent activities, such as social engineering, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. We regularly engage an independent external security firm to assess our defenses to a potential cyberattack, and these assessments may uncover new or additional vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could lead to a compromise of our systems and/or a loss of personal data. In a recent evaluation, vulnerabilities were identified that could facilitate or contribute to a security incident involving personal data. The assessment firm was able to penetrate defensive protections adopted by us, as well as protections that we obtain from third party providers. We are prioritizing the resolution of security gaps that could lead to a loss of personal data or to other damage. Despite our efforts to identify and address vulnerabilities in our systems, vulnerabilities in software products used by us are disclosed by our software providers on a daily basis, and attackers grow continuously more sophisticated in their attack methods, making it impossible to give assurance that our cybersecurity efforts will be successful.\nThere is a risk that our and our third-party vendors\u2019 preventative security controls and practices will be inadequate to prevent unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of personal and/or confidential data, or fraudulent activity, especially given that third party attacks have become more common. Any such unauthorized access or fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, more of our employees are working from their homes or other remote locations than at any other time in our history. This transition, which occurred quickly beginning in March 2020, makes it more difficult for us to monitor their activities, the security of their work locations, insider threats, and data exfiltration. This has increased the risk of security incidents, which could include unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of personal and/or confidential data, as well as other types of fraudulent activity. Any such unauthorized access or fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe potential risk of security breaches, fraud and cyberattacks may increase as we continue to introduce services and offerings, whether mobile, cloud, or otherwise. Any additional services and offerings inevitably increase the potential for a cyberattack against us. Further, data privacy and cybersecurity are subject to frequently changing laws and regulations, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), the EU Court of Justice\u2019s opinion in the \u201cSchrems II\u201d decision (which invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield) and the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d), as well as additional legislation in place, or expected to become effective, in various U.S. states and other countries. These laws and regulations are increasing in number, complexity, burden and potential financial penalties, and are often inconsistent among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. For example, the GDPR and the CPRA impose significant new compliance obligations that add costs and operational burdens to our business with respect to our collection, use, storage and retention of personal data. Compliance with these obligations could reduce operational efficiency and increase our regulatory compliance costs, and failure to satisfy these requirements may lead to significant regulatory enforcement actions and/or large private litigation in the event of a security breach or other violation. Under the GDPR, the maximum fine can be up to 4% of a company\u2019s global revenue, and there is no maximum penalty under the CPRA. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover us against claims and losses related to violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws or security breaches, social engineering, cyberattacks and other related data disclosure, loss or breach.\nWe have outsourced aspects of our business, which could result in disruption, increased costs, and reputational risk.\nWe have increasingly outsourced important processes of our business to third party vendors, which exposes us to other risks, including increased costs, potential disruptions to our business operations, and reputational risk. For example, we rely on third parties to host, manage and secure certain aspects of our data center information and technology infrastructure, to develop and maintain new technology for attracting, onboarding, managing, and analyzing our workforce, and to provide important back office support. We have increasingly centralized our vendor profile so that we are reliant on a small number of vendors for highly critical corporate and technology functions. While we believe these third-party vendors provide greater efficiency and expertise, our dependence on a small number of vendors increases the risk that our business will be adversely affected if our vendors are unable to provide these services consistent with our needs. Similarly, our business continuity and our margins could be\nadversely affected if we needed to replace one of our critical vendors for performance or economic reasons.\nOur operations also depend significantly upon these vendors\u2019 and our ability to protect our data and to ensure the availability of our servers, software applications and websites. Despite our and our third-party vendors\u2019 implementation of security measures, our systems remain susceptible to system failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyberattacks and other similar incidents, any of which could result in disruptions to our operations. A successful breach of the security of our technology systems could result in the theft of confidential, personally identifiable, or other sensitive data, including data about our employees and/or associates, or our human resources operations, any of which could damage our reputation in the market. If we are not able to realize the savings associated with outsourcing services or if there is a disruption or security breach of our outsourced services that results in a loss or damage to our data, or in an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, personally identifiable, or sensitive data, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nA loss or reduction in revenues from large client accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, which are based upon a local or regional relationship with our presence in each market, and large national and multinational client relationships. These large national and multinational clients, which comprised approximately 60% of our revenues in 2020, will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, and the client is generally able to terminate their contract with us on short notice without penalty. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of one or more large national and/or multinational clients, or a change in their strategy around the use of our services, could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues and earnings we derive from them. A loss or reduction in revenues from our large national and multinational clients could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we lose our key personnel, then our business may suffer.\nOur operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management and the performance and productivity of headquarters management and staff, our local managers and field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered. If we were to lose key personnel who have acquired significant experience in managing our business or managing companies on a global basis or in key markets, it could have a significant impact on our operations.\nIntense competition may limit our ability to attract, train and retain the qualified personnel necessary for us to meet our clients\u2019 staffing needs.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified associates who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients. In many markets, we have been experiencing an unusually tight labor market, with historically low levels of unemployment, and there is a risk that we may be unable to meet our clients\u2019 requirements in identifying an adequate number of associates. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel through recruiting and training programs to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. This is especially acute for individuals with IT and other technology skills, as competition for such individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and we expect demand for such individuals to remain very strong for the foreseeable future. Qualified personnel may not be available to us in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to us. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying and integrating into their organization\u2019s workers from diverse backgrounds, and who may represent different generations, geographical regions, and skillsets. These needs may change due to business requirements, or in response to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not be able to identify workers with the required attributes, or that our training programs may not succeed in developing effective or adequate skills. If we fail to recruit, train and retain qualified associates who meet the needs of our clients, our reputation, business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur global operations subject us to certain risks beyond our control.\nWith operations in 75 countries and territories around the world, we are subject to numerous risks outside of our control, including risks arising from political unrest and other political events, regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, strikes and other worker unrest, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, international conflict, severe weather conditions, pandemics, including COVID-19, and other global health emergencies, disruptions of infrastructure and utilities, cyberattacks, and other events beyond our control.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and financial results.\nOur ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe believe our reputation, along with our brand equity in the ManpowerGroup name and our various other brands, are important corporate resources that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, employees, competitors, vendors, franchisees and other third-party brand licensees, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about ManpowerGroup, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could materially adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could materially adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the ManpowerGroup name and our other brand names, and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.\nChanges in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect the marketplace for our services.\nFrom time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory agencies and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted when clients use contingent staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of contingent staffing arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups or regulatory agencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our thought leadership and other intellectual property, which is important to our success.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property including the value of our brands. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements, and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products, services and solutions similar to ours. Further, the steps we take might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future.\nStrategic Risks\nWe may be unable to effectively implement our business strategy, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our objectives.\nOur business strategy focuses on growing revenues while improving our operating profits. An important element of our strategy is our effort to diversify our revenues beyond our core staffing and employment services. This includes expanding our sales in higher margin professional resourcing, such as our Experis brand in IT recruitment. There is a risk that our growth strategy in Experis may be impeded due to the scarcity of talent in the IT field, which is particularly in demand, and which may restrict our ability to fulfill customer requirements. Similarly, another aspect of our strategy to expand beyond our core staffing and employment services is through the sale of innovative workforce solutions designed to achieve higher operating margins. Our higher-margin Right Management career management services have historically performed well in periods of downturn, and it is part of our business\nstrategy that this counter-cyclical effect would help cushion our results in the event of a future period of decline. However, in the event of a downturn, there can be no assurances that the margin contribution from Right Management would increase, or that it would significantly offset other declines we might experience in the business. Additionally, our workforce solutions are often unique, non-repeatable and tailored to a client\u2019s needs, and present costs, risks and complexity that may be difficult to calculate. These solutions may be unprofitable if we are not able to accurately anticipate these costs and risks in our pricing for these solutions. For example, we may fail to structure and price our solutions in a manner that properly compensates us to create an adequate delivery model, to adequately manage new solutions, or to obtain adequate insurance coverage in amount or scope to cover potential risks arising from such solutions.\nOur business strategy also includes continuing efforts to transform how we use personnel and technology to enhance our delivery of services. Our goal is to become a more agile and effective competitor, to reduce the cost of operating our business and to increase our operating profit and operating profit margin. These efforts to transform how we do business may not be successful, and we may not succeed at reducing our operating costs or preventing the return of any costs that are eliminated. Additionally, reductions in personnel and other changes could materially adversely affect our ability to effectively operate our business. If, for these or other reasons, we are not successful in implementing our business strategy or achieving the anticipated results, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions.\nOur success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. For example, rapid changes in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics are having a significant impact on some of the industries we serve and could have significant and unforeseen consequences for the workforce services industry and for our business. There is a risk that these, or other developments, could result in significant rapid disruption to our business model, and that we will be unprepared to compete effectively.\nAdditionally, our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support applicant on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, payroll, and client data analytics. There is a risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or evolve our business with the right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to changes in our marketplace. Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to particular technologies to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business, and there is a risk they will be unsuccessful. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nOur acquisition strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business due to unexpected or underestimated costs.\nFrom time to time, we make acquisitions of other companies or operating assets or enter into operating joint ventures. These activities involve significant risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the operations, financial reporting, services and corporate culture of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nfailure of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form, to meet performance expectations, which could trigger payment obligations;\n\u2022\nover-valuation by us of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form;\n\u2022\ndisputes that arise with sellers;\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively monitor compliance with corporate policies as well as regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ninsufficient indemnification from the selling parties for liabilities incurred by the acquired companies prior to the acquisitions; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our business because they may result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business. In addition, future acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and liquidity. Possible impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life or restructuring charges could also occur.\nFrom time to time, there may be dispositions we undertake via sales, franchises, joint ventures or other exit activities, and we may face risks related to such transactions.\nFrom time to time we review the effectiveness of our global operations, including our global geographic footprint, and we may elect to exit certain countries or operations after analyzing their performance or their position in our overall global strategy. We have engaged in such dispositions in the past, and we expect that we will continue to dispose of portions of our business that are not meeting our performance or strategic objectives. Among other alternatives, this could take the form of a closure of a business, the contribution of the business to a joint venture, or an exit by means of a sale to, or a franchise arrangement with, a third party. There are risks and costs associated with any exit activities, which could include difficulties in the separation of operations, services or personnel, the diversion of management attention, and the disruption of our business. Any such transactions may require regulatory or governmental approvals, which could impede the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in, or liability with respect to, the divested businesses. As a result of divestiture transactions, we could incur severance charges for personnel and payments for lease and other commitments, charges from the impairment or write-off of assets, and other financial loss due to the transaction. Furthermore, there is the risk that we might lose customers, in particular multinational clients with operations in the exited countries or operations. Additionally, if we choose to enter into a franchise arrangement for a third party to operate our business in the exited region using our trademarks and other licensed assets, we face potential counterparty and reputational risks arising from the franchisee\u2019s operation of the business. The reputational risks include the risk that marketplace participants, including clients, candidates and the media, may believe that we continue to control the operations of a divested or franchised business that operates utilizing our name or other trademarks.\nFinancial and Market Risks\nForeign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAlthough we report our results of operations in United States dollars, the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. Highly inflationary economies of certain foreign countries, such as Argentina in 2018, can result in foreign currency devaluation, which may also negatively impact our reported financial results.\nDuring 2020, approximately 87% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States, the majority of which were generated in Europe. Furthermore, $1,123.9 million of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2020, was denominated in foreign currencies, including $1,094.5 million related to our Euro-denominated notes (\u20ac900.0 million). Increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar against other major currencies, or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into United States dollars, could affect our revenues, operating profit and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign currencies, in particular the Euro, could have a material adverse effect on our reported results and shareholders\u2019 equity, however, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses unless we repatriate funds. Furthermore, the volatility of currencies may make year-over-year comparability of our financial results difficult.\nWe seek to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing net investment hedges and, from time to time, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps. A portion of our Euro-denominated notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2020, to mitigate our Euro currency translation exposure. The effectiveness of this hedge in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain or uneven demand for our services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may only offset a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates over the time the hedge is in place or effective.\nOur liquidity could be adversely impacted by economic conditions affecting our clients.\nOur working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables which generally increase as sales increase. One of the ways in which we measure our working capital is in terms of working capital as a percent of revenue with a\nfocus on Days Sales Outstanding (\u201cDSO\u201d). During periods of decline or uncertainty, our clients may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. In addition, some clients have begun to impose more challenging billing terms, which increases the length of time before we receive payment for services. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our DSO will increase, and our cash flow, liquidity, and profitability may suffer.\nOur results of operations and share price could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements timely, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements. If any of these were to occur, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur debt levels could materially adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1,123.9 million of total debt. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, significant acquisition opportunities, or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing;\n\u2022\nborrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at a variable interest rate, making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates; and\n\u2022\nwe could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions.\nOur failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates.\nThe lenders under our and our subsidiaries\u2019 credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to extend credit to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf our liquidity needs increase, we would expect to use our revolving credit facility, which is provided by a syndicate of banks. Each bank in the syndicate is responsible on a several, but not joint, basis for providing a portion of the loans under the facility. If any of the participants in the syndicate fails to satisfy its obligations to extend credit under the facility, the other participants refuse or are unable to assume its obligations and we are unable to find an alternative source of funding at comparable rates, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, or our interest expense may increase substantially.\nFurthermore, a number of our subsidiaries maintain uncommitted lines of credit with various banks. Under the terms of these lines of credit, the bank is not obligated to make loans to the subsidiary or to make loans to the subsidiary at a particular interest rate. If any of these banks cancel these lines of credit or otherwise refuse to extend credit on acceptable terms, we may need to extend credit to those subsidiaries or the liquidity of our subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected.\nThe performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute cash to our parent company may vary, negatively affecting our ability to service our debt at the parent company level or in other subsidiaries.\nSince we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our consequent ability to service our debt depends in part upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to our parent company, or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to our parent company or to other subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends and the making of such loans and advances by our subsidiaries may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions, depend upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and working capital requirements, and be subject to various business considerations, including the ability of such subsidiaries to pay such dividends or make such loans and advances.\nIn addition, in 2020, during the pandemic, we participated in subsidy programs of various governments. If we continue to participate in these programs, there is a risk that these programs could impose restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to declare dividends or repatriate cash outside of the sponsor country, which could significantly impact liquidity at the parent level if we are not able to comply with the specific country requirements.\nOur inability to secure guarantees or letters of credit on acceptable terms may substantially increase our cost of doing business in various countries.\nIn a number of countries and territories in which we conduct business we are obligated to provide guarantees or letters of credit to secure licenses, lease space or for insurance coverage. We typically receive these guarantees and letters of credit from a number of financial institutions around the world. In the event that we are unable to secure these arrangements from a bank, lender or other third party on acceptable terms, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, there could be a disruption to our business or there could be a substantial increase in cost for our business.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new United States or international tax legislation or tax audits that could result in additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions where we have operations. The tax bases and rates of these respective tax jurisdictions change from time to time due to economic and political conditions. Our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the respective tax laws. Our other taxes are impacted by changes in local tax laws or changes in our business.\nIn addition, tax accounting involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income and other taxes and tax assets and liabilities. These complex matters include transfer pricing and reporting related to intercompany transactions. We are routinely subject to tax examinations by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may disagree in the future, with our judgments. Many taxing authorities are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\nIn addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. The changes recommended by the OECD have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business. In addition, the European Commission has expanded upon the OECD guidelines with anti-tax avoidance directives to be applied by its member states. Among other things, the directives require companies to provide increased country-by-country disclosure of their financial information to tax authorities, which in turn could lead to\ndisagreements by jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits between them. These possible changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, could have an adverse impact on our current or future tax positions.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may result in losses for investors.\nThe market price for our common stock may be subject to significant volatility. For example, during 2020, the price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange ranged from a high of $100.99 to a low of $49.57. Our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including factors listed in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and others, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncement of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\nchanges in investor sentiment regarding the company arising from these or other events, or the economy in general.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nOur performance on contracts may be materially adversely affected if we or third parties fail to deliver on commitments.\nOur contracts are increasingly complex and, in most instances, require that we partner with other parties to provide the workforce solutions required by our clients. Our clients have become more sophisticated in their contractual negotiation process and more detailed in defining their operational requirements. Our ability to deliver these solutions and provide the services required by our clients is dependent on our and our partners\u2019 ability to meet our clients\u2019 delivery requirements and schedules. If we or our partners fail to deliver services on time and in accordance with contractual performance obligations, including as a result of delivery challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, then our ability to successfully complete our contracts may be affected, which may have a material and adverse impact on our client relations, revenues and profitability. Additionally, we may incur liability for the actions or omissions of our partners or vendors and we may face challenges or be unable to enforce these obligations against those partners.\nGovernment regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce our future earnings.\nIn many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, Italy and Germany, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in Germany restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which our associates may be used. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our associates. Additionally, in some countries, trade unions have used the political process to target our industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing contingent workforce solutions. Moreover, many countries, including the Netherlands and Japan, have established regulations that require equal-pay for equal-work for temporary workers and fixed term employees. These continuously-evolving regulations could have a significant impact to our revenues, costs, and operating margins as we and customers adjust to these new regulations. Furthermore, many countries are also expanding enforcement of immigration laws, and there is a risk that we will incur greater expense in connection with immigration law compliance.\nThe countries and territories in which we operate may, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we currently provide;\n\u2022\nrequire new or additional benefits be paid to our associates;\n\u2022\nrequire pay parity for our associates;\n\u2022\nrequire us to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or\n\u2022\nincrease taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes.\nFor example, in November 2020, new legislation was proposed in Mexico that could ban many types of temporary placements under the country\u2019s labor laws. The proposal could broadly prohibit the provision of our traditional temporary staffing services, only allowing outsourced worker assignments for special, deliverables-based projects outside of the client\u2019s core business activity. If this proposal were enacted into law, it could have a material adverse impact on our business in Mexico.\nOther types of future regulation may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results by making it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide employment services, particularly if we cannot pass along increases in costs to our clients.\nFailure to comply with antibribery and corruption laws could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are additionally subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements that prohibit bribery and corrupt acts. These include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, as well as similar legislation in many of the countries and territories in which we operate. Our employees (but not our temporary associates) are required to participate in a global anticorruption compliance training program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. However, there are no assurances this program will be effective. In many countries where we operate, practices in the local business community may not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption law or regulations. Furthermore, we remain subject to the risk that one of our employees (or one of our associates on a temporary or contract-based assignment) could engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and these laws and regulations. Any such violations could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may be exposed to legal claims, including employment-related claims that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of potential litigation and other legal claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctive relief against us.\nFor example, through our direct interaction with our clients\u2019 businesses and facilities, including functions and systems that are sensitive or critical to their core businesses, we may be exposed to operational, regulatory, reputational and other risks specific to their business, including data security risks. These risks may be reduced through contractual provisions that limit damages or mitigate our responsibility for losses caused by our assigned workers; but these types of contractual protections are not always possible because we may perceive an important economic opportunity, because of the contracting practices of our industry competitors or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas.\nWe are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses. Risks relating to these activities include:\n\u2022\nclaims by our associates of discrimination or harassment directed at them, including claims relating to actions of our clients;\n\u2022\nclaims by our associates of wrongful termination or retaliation;\n\u2022\nclaims arising out of the actions or inactions of our associates, including matters for which we may have indemnified a client;\n\u2022\nclaims arising from violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues;\n\u2022\nclaims related to classification of workers as employees or independent contractors;\n\u2022\nclaims related to the employment of undocumented or illegal workers;\n\u2022\npayment of workers\u2019 compensation claims and other similar claims;\n\u2022\nviolations of employee pay and benefits requirements such as violations of wage and hour requirements;\n\u2022\nentitlement to employee benefits, including healthcare coverage;\n\u2022\nerrors and omissions of our associates and other individuals working on our behalf in performing their jobs, such as accountants, IT professionals, engineers and other technical workers; and\n\u2022\nclaims by our clients relating to our associates\u2019 misuse of clients\u2019 proprietary information, misappropriation of funds, other criminal activity or torts or other similar claims.\nWe may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems. In addition, some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming to our management team and costly and could have a negative impact on our business regardless of the merits of the claim. For example, in the past, we have devoted considerable time and expense to resolve several California-based \u201cwage and hour\u201d claims that asserted deficiencies in our payroll practices, and we are frequently sued by plaintiffs in various other employment-related matters, including those seeking class action status in the US. It is likely we will continue to experience similar claims in the future, which may increase in number as a result of remote working assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe cannot be certain our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies.\nOur business exposes us to competition law risk.\nWe are subject to antitrust and competition law in the United States, the European Union, and many other regions in which we operate. Some of our business models may carry a heightened risk of regulatory inquiry under relevant competition laws. Although we have put in place safeguards designed to maintain compliance with applicable competition laws, there can be no assurance these protections will be adequate. Competition law authorities have investigated our business practices in the past in France and in other countries, and there continues to be a risk of such inquiries in the future. There is no assurance we would successfully defend against any such regulatory inquiries, and they could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, remain outstanding for a significant duration, and result in adverse publicity, even if successfully resolved. An unfavorable outcome could result in liabilities that have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make the takeover of our company more difficult.\nCertain provisions of Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently include:\n\u2022\npermitting removal of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nproviding that vacancies on the board of directors will be filled by the remaining directors then in office; and\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominees.\nIn addition, the Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin\u2019s \u201cfair price\u201d and \u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions, in addition to other provisions of Wisconsin law, limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances. As a result, offers to acquire us, which may represent a premium over the available market price of our common stock, may be withdrawn or otherwise fail to be realized. The provisions described above could cause our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 75285, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "MAN"}
