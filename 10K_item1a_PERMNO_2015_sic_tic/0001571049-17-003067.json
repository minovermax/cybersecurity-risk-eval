{"cik": "837852", "company": "WECAST NETWORK, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company may be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause the Company\u2019s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nSubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, the Company has incurred significant losses during 2016 and 2015 and has relied on debt and equity financings to fund our operations. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had net current liabilities (current assets less current liabilities) of $4,084,000. Management\u2019s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 3.\nThe Company must continue to rely on proceeds from debt and equity issuances to pay for ongoing operating expenses in order to execute its business plan. On March 28, 2016, the Company completed a common stock financing with SSS for $10.0 million. In addition, the Company completed two common stock financing with Seven Star Works Co. Ltd. (\u201cSSW\u201d) for $4.0 million, and with Harvest Alternative Investment Opportunities SPC (\u201cHarvest\u201d) for $4.0 million on July 19, 2016 and August 12, 2016, respectively. On November 17, 2016, the Company completed on additional common stock financing with Wecast Media Group Limited (formerly known as Sun Seven Star Hong Kong Cultural Development Limited) for $2.0 million. Although the Company believes it has the ability to raise funds by issuing debt or equity instruments, additional financing may not be available to the Company on terms acceptable to the Company or at all or such resources may not be received in a timely manner.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are in fact unable to continue as a going concern, our shareholders may lose their entire investment in our Company.\nThe Company is in the process of transforming its business model and this transformation may not be successful.\nThe Company is in the process of transforming its business model, by leveraging and optimizing its current operations as a premium content Video On Demand service provider in China to evolve into a global, B2B2C, mobile-driven, consumer management platform for both enterprises and consumers. By aiming to establish the world\u2019s premier multimedia, social networking and e-commerce- enabled network with the largest global effective connected user base, Wecast Network, through this expanded, cloud-based, ecosystem of connected screens combined with strong partnerships with leading global providers, will be capable of delivering a vast array of Wecast Network-branded products and services to enterprise customers and end-use consumers - anytime and anywhere, across multiple platforms and devices. In connection with this transformation, the Company has recently assembled a new experienced management team, stabilized the foundation, capitalized and rebranded the Company, reconfigured the business structure, expanded the Company\u2019s mission and business lines, made several key investments and finally, injected several privately held and revenue producing assets into the corporation. It is uncertain whether these efforts will prove beneficial or whether we will be able to develop the necessary business models, infrastructure and systems to support the business. This includes having or hiring the right talent to execute our business strategy. Market acceptance of new product and service offerings will be dependent in part on our ability to include functionality and usability that address customer requirements, and optimally price our products and services to meet customer demand and cover our costs.\nAny failure to implement this plan in accordance with our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Even if the anticipated benefits and savings are substantially realized, there may be consequences, internal control issues, or business impacts that were not expected. Additionally, as a result of our restructuring efforts in connection with our business transformation plan, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge or loss of efficiency during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating activities and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these activities, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may differ from market expectations.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past, and may vary significantly in the future, due to a number of factors which could have an adverse impact on our business. Our revenue may fluctuate as our channel partners make changes to their business model and we rely on third-party payment platforms to produce billing based on payment collection from end-users across all platforms. In recent years, video content costs escalated sharply in the industry which affected our ability to procure new content at the same cost as prior years. In addition, we incurred certain impairment losses of intangible assets and earn-out share award expenses as discussed in Note 7 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nExpansion of our business may put added pressure on our management and operational infrastructure, impeding our ability to meet any potential increased demand for our services and possibly hurting our future operating results.\nOur business plan is to significantly grow our operations to meet anticipated growth in demand for the services that we offer, and by the introduction of new goods or services. Growth in our businesses may place a significant strain on our personnel, management, financial systems and other resources. The evolution of our business also presents numerous risks and challenges, including:\n. our ability to successfully and rapidly expand sales to potential new distributors in response to potentially increasing demand;\n. the costs associated with such growth, which are difficult to quantify, but could be significant; and\n. rapid technological change.\nTo accommodate any such growth and compete effectively, we may need to obtain additional funding to improve information systems, procedures and controls and expand, train, motivate and manage our employees, and such funding may not be available in sufficient quantities, if at all. If we are not able to manage these activities and implement these strategies successfully to expand to meet any increased demand, our operating results could suffer.\nIn order to comply with PRC regulatory requirements, we operate our businesses through companies with which we have contractual relationships. By virtue of these contractual relationships, we control the economic interests and have the power to direct the activities of these entities, and are therefore determined to be the primary beneficiary of these entities, but we do not have any equity ownership interest in these entities. If the PRC government determines that our contractual agreements with these entities are not in compliance with applicable regulations, our business in the PRC could be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not have direct or indirect equity ownership of our VIEs, which collectively operate all our businesses in China, but instead have entered into contractual arrangements with our VIEs and each of its individual legal shareholder(s) pursuant to which we received an economic interest in, and have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs, in a manner substantially similar to a controlling equity interest. Although we believe that our business operations are in compliance with the current laws in China, we cannot be sure that the PRC government would view our operating arrangements to be in compliance with PRC regulations that may be adopted in the future. If we are determined not to be in compliance, the PRC government could levy fines, revoke our business and operating licenses, require us to restrict or discontinue our operations, restrict our right to collect revenues, require us to restructure our business, corporate structure or operations, impose additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply, impose restrictions on our business operations or on our customers, or take other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. As a result, our business in the PRC could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with our VIEs for our operations, which may not be as effective for providing control over these entities as direct ownership.\nOur operations and financial results are dependent on our VIEs in which we have no equity ownership interest and must rely on contractual arrangements to control and operate the businesses of our VIEs. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective for providing control over the VIEs as direct ownership. For example, the VIEs may be unwilling or unable to perform its contractual obligations under our commercial agreements. Consequently, we may not be able to conduct our operations in the manner currently planned. In addition, the VIEs may seek to renew their agreements on terms that are disadvantageous to us. Although we have entered into a series of agreements that provide us with the ability to control the VIEs, we may not succeed in enforcing our rights under them insofar as our contractual rights and legal remedies under PRC law are inadequate. In addition, if we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms when these agreements expire or to enter into similar agreements with other parties, our business may not be able to operate or expand, and our operating expenses may significantly increase.\nOur arrangements with our VIEs and its respective shareholders may be subject to a transfer pricing adjustment by the PRC tax authorities which could have an adverse effect on our income and expenses.\nWe could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that our contracts with our VIEs and their respective shareholders were not entered into based on arm\u2019s length negotiations. Although our contractual arrangements are similar to those of other companies conducting similar operations in China, if the PRC tax authorities determine that these contracts were not entered into on an arm\u2019s length basis, they may adjust our income and expenses for PRC tax purposes in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. Such an adjustment may require that we pay additional PRC taxes plus applicable penalties and interest, if any.\nIf we do not obtain shareholder approval of certain potential common stock issuances to BT Capital Global Limited, or BT Capital, a promissory note held by BT Capital will be due, and we may not have the resources to repay such note.\nUnder the rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market, we generally may not issue more than 4.99% of our outstanding shares in connection with an acquisition where a related party has an interest in the target, unless we obtain shareholder approval. On January 30, 2017, we entered into an Securities Purchase Agreement (the \u201cSecurities Purchase Agreement\u201d) with BT Capital for the purchase by us of all of the outstanding capital stock of Sun Video Group Hong Kong Limited (\u201cSVG\u201d), an affiliate of the Company\u2019s chairman Bruno Wu, for an aggregate purchase price of (i) $800,000; and (ii) a convertible promissory note (the \u201cSVG Note\u201d) with the principal and interest thereon convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a conversion rate of $1.50 per share. BT has guaranteed that SVG will achieve certain financial goals within 12 months of the closing. The SVG Note has a stated principal amount of $50 million, bears interest at the rate of 0.56% per annum and matures on December 31, 2017. In the event of default, the SVG Note will become immediately due and payable, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, until receipt of necessary Company\u2019s shareholder approvals, the SVG Note is not convertible into shares of Company common stock.\nAlthough we will put this proposal to our shareholders for their approval, no assurances can be given that we will obtain such shareholder approval. If we fail to obtain such shareholder approval by December 31, 2017 (unless such maturity date for the SVG Note is extended), BT Capital may require us to satisfy all of our obligations under the SVG Note, including the payment in full of all principal and interest, and may pursue other legal or equitable remedies against us. Our ability to make such cash payments will depend on available cash resources at that time, and there can be no assurance that we will have the cash necessary to make such payments. Early payment of the SVG Note could therefore have a significantly adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe success of our business is dependent on our ability to retain our existing key employees and to add and retain senior officers to our management.\nWe depend on the services of our key employees, in particular, Mr. Bing Yang, our Chief Executive Officer. Our success will largely depend on our ability to retain these key employees and to attract and retain qualified senior and middle level managers to our management team. We have recruited executives and management in China to assist in our ability to manage the business and to recruit and oversee employees. While we believe we offer compensation packages that are consistent with market practice, we cannot be certain that we will be able to hire and retain sufficient personnel to support our business. In addition, severe capital constraints have limited our ability to attract specialized personnel. Moreover, our budget limitations will restrict our ability to hire qualified personnel. The loss of any of our key employees would significantly harm our business. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants and established film and media industry competitors.\nThe Chinese market for film and media content and services is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. Barriers to entry may be relatively minimal, and current and new competitors may be able to provide film and media content at a lower cost. Although the Chinese government continues to improve its efforts to enforce intellectual property protection, pirated film and media content continues to be prevalent in China, which may reduce our potential profits. In addition, other companies offer competitive products or services including Chinese language content. Furthermore, as many of our existing competitors, as well as a number of potential competitors, have longer operating histories in the entertainment, film, media or Internet service markets, greater name and brand recognition, better relationships with key players, larger customer bases and libraries and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have, we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. Any increased competition could reduce our subscribers, make it difficult for us to attract and retain subscribers, reduce or eliminate our market share, lower our profit margins and reduce our revenues.\nVideos and other types of content displayed on Internet platforms may be found objectionable by PRC regulatory authorities, which may result in penalties and other administrative actions against us.\nThe PRC government has adopted regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of videos over the Internet. Although we have adopted internal procedures to obtain the appropriate PRC censorship and regulatory approval for content licensed to us, new regulations and implementation guidance may require us to limit or eliminate the dissemination of certain content through Internet channels. Moreover, the costs of compliance with these regulations may continue to increase as we procure more content to support our business growth. In addition, we may also face litigation or administrative action for defamation, negligence, or other purported injuries resulting from content programming operated by us. Such litigation and administrative actions, with or without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming and may result in significant diversion of resources and management attention from our business operations. Furthermore, such litigation or administrative actions may adversely affect our brand image and reputation.\nWe derived a substantial portion of our revenue from several major customers. If we lose any of these customers, or if the volume of business with these distribution partners decline, our revenues may be significantly affected.\nRevenue from four of our distribution partners accounted for about 59% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and revenue from three of our distribution partners accounted for over 41% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. Due to our reliance on a limited number of distribution partners, any of the following events may cause a material decline in our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations:\n. reductions, delays or cessation of purchases from one or more significant distribution partner;\n. loss of one or more distribution partner and our inability to find new distribution partners that can generate the same volume of business; and\n. failure of any distribution partner to make timely payment of our products and services.\nWe cannot be certain whether these relationships will continue to develop or if these distribution partners will continue to generate significant revenue for us in the future.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud may be adversely affected, and investor confidence and market price of our shares may be adversely impacted.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX 404\u201d), the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. Under current law, we became subject to these requirements beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. Our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures have been ineffective, and failure to improve them could lead to future errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or untimely filings, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, and a decline in our stock price.\nIn 2016, a material weakness was identified in the internal control of financial reporting related to the design, documentation and implementation of effective internal controls over the review of the cash flow forecasts used in the accounting for licensed content. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain effective internal controls related to management's review of the data inputs and assumptions used in its cash flow forecasts for licensed content recoverability.\nManagement used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2016) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As of December 31, 2016, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective based on this assessment. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures - Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\u201d\nIf we fail to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our management may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level. This could in turn result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and negatively impact the trading price of our shares.\nRISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA\nU.S. financial regulatory and law enforcement agencies, including without limitation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. national securities exchanges, have limited ability, and in fact may have no ability, to conduct investigations within the People\u2019s Republic of China concerning the Company, our PRC-based officers, directors, market research services or other professional services or experts.\nMost of our assets and substantially all of our current operations are conducted in the PRC, and some of our officers, directors and other professional service providers are nationals and residents of China. U.S. financial regulatory and law enforcement agencies, including without limitation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. national securities exchanges, have limited ability, and in fact may have no ability, to conduct investigations within the PRC concerning the Company, and China may have limited or no agreements in place to facilitate cooperation with the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement for investigations within its jurisdiction. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, are based in China, and work papers regarding the Company may be maintained in China, where the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Any limitations on the ability of U.S. financial regulatory and law enforcement agencies, including the PCAOB, to access books, records and testimony, to conduct onsite investigation of operations, to exercise subpoena power and to take other investigative actions, including those stemming from investor tips, complaints and referrals, may deprive investors of the benefits and protections of these agencies, and investors may lose confidence in, or be skeptical as to the quality of, the Company\u2019s disclosures in filings with the SEC, reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements, or the Company\u2019s compliance with the rules and regulations of such agencies.\nAdverse changes in political, economic and other policies of the Chinese government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could materially and adversely affect the growth of our business and our competitive position.\nOur business operations are conducted in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including:\n. the degree of government involvement;\n. the level of development;\n. the growth rate;\n. the control of foreign exchange;\n. the allocation of resources;\n. an evolving and rapidly changing regulatory system; and\n. a lack of sufficient transparency in the regulatory process.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past 30 years, growth has been uneven, both geographically and across various sectors of the economy. The Chinese economy has also experienced certain adverse effects due to the global financial crisis. In addition, the growth rate of China\u2019s gross domestic product has slowed in recent years to 6.9% in 2015 and 6.7% in 2016, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments, foreign currency exchange restrictions or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us.\nThe Chinese economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Although in recent years the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of the productive assets in China is still owned by the Chinese government. The continued control of these assets and other aspects of the national economy by the Chinese government could materially and adversely affect our business. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over Chinese economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nAny adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material adverse effect on overall economic growth, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and consequently have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and to us, which could cause material adverse effects to our business operations.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business through our subsidiaries and VIEs in the PRC. Our subsidiaries and VIEs are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign invested entities established in the PRC (\u201cFIEs\u201d). The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. For example, on January 19, 2015, MOFCOM published a draft of the PRC law on Foreign Investment (Draft for Comment), of the Draft Foreign Investment Law, which was open for public comments until February 17, 2015. At the same time, MOFCOM published an accompanying explanatory note of the Draft Foreign Investment Law, or the Explanatory Note, which contains important information about the Draft Foreign Investment Law, including its drafting philosophy and principles, main content, plans to transition to the new legal regime and treatment of business in China controlled by FIEs, primarily through contractual arrangements such as VIE arrangements. The Draft Foreign Investment Law is intended to replace the current foreign investment legal regime consisting of three laws: the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law, as well as detailed implementing rules. The Draft Foreign Investment Law proposes significant changes to the PRC foreign investment legal regime and may have a material impact on Chinese companies listed or to be listed overseas. The proposed Draft Foreign Investment Law is to regulate FIEs the same way as PRC domestic entities, except for those FIEs that operate in industries deemed to be either \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d in a \u201cNegative List.\u201d As the Negative List has yet to be published, it is unclear whether it will differ from the current list of industries subject to restrictions or prohibitions on foreign investment. The Draft Foreign Investment Law also provides that only FIEs operating in industries on the Negative List will require entry clearance and other approvals that are not required of PRC domestic entities. As a result of the entry clearance and approvals, certain FIEs operating in industries on the Negative List may not be able to continue to conduct their operations through contractual arrangements. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the online VOD business and value-added telecommunications industries, in which our VIEs operate, will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in the \u201cnegative list\u201d to be issued.\nThe Draft Foreign Investment Law has not taken a position on what actions will be taken with respect to the existing VIE structures, while it is soliciting comments from the public on this point by illustrating several possible options. Under these varied options, a company that has a VIE structure and conducts the business on the \u201cnegative list\u201d at the time of enactment of the new Foreign Investment Law has either the option or obligation to disclose its corporate structure to the authorities, while the authorities may either permit the company to continue to maintain the VIE structure (if the company is deemed ultimately controlled by PRC nationals), or require the company to dispose of its businesses and/or VIE structure based on circumstantial considerations. The Draft Foreign Investment Law also provides that only FIEs operating in industries on the Negative List will require entry clearance and other approvals that are not required of PRC domestic entities. As a result of such entry clearance and approvals or certain restructuring of our corporate structure and operations, to be completed by companies with existing VIE structure like us, we face substantial uncertainties as to whether these actions can be timely completed, or at all, and our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough the overall effect of legislation over the past three decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in China, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system. And recently enacted laws, rules and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China or may be subject to significant degree of interpretation by PRC regulatory agencies and courts. Since the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of many laws, regulations, and rules are not always uniform, and enforcement of these laws, regulations, and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and to us. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and which may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until after the occurrence of the violation.\nIn addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention. In addition, some of our executive officers and directors are residents of China and not of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to affect service of process in the United States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against our Chinese operations and entities.\nWe depend upon contractual arrangements with our VIEs for the success of our business and these arrangements may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership of these businesses and may be difficult to enforce.\nOur operations are primarily conducted in the PRC, where the PRC government restricts or prohibits foreign-owned enterprises from owning Internet content, telecommunication, and certain other operations in the PRC. Accordingly, we depend on our VIEs, in which we have no direct ownership interest, to provide those services through contractual agreements among the parties and to hold some of our assets. These arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over our operations through direct ownership of these businesses. Due to our VIE structure, we have to rely on contractual rights to effect control and management of our VIEs, which exposes us to the risk of potential breach of contract by the VIEs or their shareholders. A failure by our VIEs or their shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, if the shareholders of our VIEs were involved in proceedings that had an adverse impact on their shareholder interests in such VIEs or on our ability to enforce relevant contracts related to the VIE structure, our business would be adversely affected.\nAs all of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through either arbitration or litigation in the PRC, they would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. We would have to rely for enforcement on legal remedies under PRC law, including specific performance, injunctive relief or damages, which might not be effective. As these PRC governmental authorities have wide discretion in granting such approvals, we could fail to obtain such approval. In addition, our VIE contracts might not be enforceable in China if PRC governmental authorities, courts or arbitral tribunals took the view that such contracts contravened PRC law or were otherwise not enforceable for public policy reasons. In the event we were unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we would not be able to exert effective control over our VIEs, and our ability to conduct our business, and our financial condition and results of operations, would be severely adversely affected.\nYou may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nMost of our assets are located outside of the United States and most of our current operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition, some of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, that are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. Courts in China may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security, or the public interest. So it is uncertain whether a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered against us by a court in the United States.\nThe PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.\nThe PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.\nAccordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.\nActivities of Internet content providers are or will be subject to additional PRC regulations, which have not yet been put into effect, could substantially affect our business activities and financial performance.\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (\u201cMIIT\u201d) has stated that the activities of Internet content providers are subject to regulation by various PRC government authorities, depending on the specific activities conducted by the Internet content provider. Various government authorities have stated publicly that they are in the process of preparing new laws and regulations that will govern these activities. The areas of regulation currently include online advertising, online news reporting, online publishing, provision of online or mobile music, online securities trading, the provision of industry-specific (e.g., drug-related) information over the Internet and foreign investment in value-added telecommunication services. Other aspects of media transferred through Internet mediums may be subject to additional regulations in the future. We cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities will not issue new laws or regulations that will adversely impact our business activities and financial performance.\nThe enforcement of the PRC labor contract law may materially increase our costs and decrease our net income.\nChina adopted a new Labor Contract Law, effective on January 1, 2008, issued its implementation rules and regulations, effective on September 18, 2008, and amended the Labor Contract Law, effective on July 1, 2013. The Labor Contract Law and related rules and regulations impose more stringent requirements on employers with regard to, among other things, minimum wages, severance payment and non-fixed-term employment contracts, time limits for probation periods, as well as the duration and the times that an employee can be placed on a fixed-term employment contract. Due to the limited period of effectiveness of the Labor Contract Law, its implementation rules and regulations and its amendment, and the lack of clarity with respect to its implementation and the potential penalties and fines, it is uncertain how it will impact our current employment policies and practices. In particular, compliance with the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules and regulations may increase our operating expenses. In the event that we decide to terminate some of our employees or otherwise change our employment or labor practices, the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules and regulations may also limit our ability to effect those changes in a manner that we believe to be cost-effective or desirable, and could result in a material decrease in our profitability.\nFuture inflation in China may inhibit our ability to conduct business in China.\nIn recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion, significant stock market volatility and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. In 2010 and 2011, for example, the Chinese economy experienced high inflation and to curb the accelerating inflation, the People\u2019s Bank of China (\u201cPBOC\u201d), China central bank, raised benchmark interest rates three times in 2011. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our products and services and our company.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales effectively.\nAt present, all of our sales will be settled in RMB, and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that FIEs may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks in China authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, SAFE and other relevant PRC governmental authorities and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. This could affect our ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing for our subsidiaries and the variable interest entities. Recent volatility in the RMB foreign exchange rate as well as capital flight out of China may lead to further foreign exchange restrictions and policies or practices which adversely affect our operations and ability to convert RMB. We cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nThe value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars, as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future.\nSince July 2005, the RMB has no longer been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People\u2019s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies.\nRestrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, pay dividends to you, and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nAt present, all of our sales are earned by our PRC operating entities. However, PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent companies. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC subsidiaries only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC subsidiaries are also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of their annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC GAAP to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches 50% of their registered capital. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nFailure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident shareholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us.\nSAFE has promulgated several regulations, including the Notice Concerning Foreign Exchange Controls on Domestic Residents\u2019 Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles (\u201cCircular 75\u201d), effective on November 1, 2005, and the Circular on Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration Over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents Via Special Purpose Vehicles (\u201cCircular 37\u201d), effective on July 4, 2015, which replaced Circular 75. Under Circular 37, PRC residents must register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity for the purpose of holding domestic or offshore assets or interests, referred to as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d in Circular 37. In addition, amendments to the registration must be made in the event of any material change, such as an increase or decrease in share capital contributed by the individual PRC resident shareholder, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Failure to comply with the specified registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on capital inflows from the offshore entity to the PRC entity. Further, failure to comply with the SAFE registration requirements may result in penalties under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange regulations.\nWe have asked our shareholders who are PRC residents as defined in Circular 37 and related rules to register with the relevant branch of SAFE, as currently required, in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions of equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries. However, we cannot provide any assurances that they can obtain the above SAFE registrations required by Circular 37 and related rules. Moreover, because Circular 37 is newly issued, there is uncertainty over how Circular 37 and related rules will be interpreted and implemented and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us, and we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, our present and prospective PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Circular 37 and related rules by our PRC resident beneficial holders. In addition, such PRC residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by Circular 37 and related rules. We have little control over either our present or prospective direct or indirect shareholders or the outcome of such registration procedures.\nWe may be unable to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations which became effective on September 8, 2006.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, promulgated the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, which became effective on September 8, 2006 and was amended in June 2009. This regulation, among other things, governs the approval process by which a PRC company may participate in an acquisition of assets or equity interests. Depending on the structure of the transaction, the regulation will require the PRC parties to make a series of applications and supplemental applications to the government agencies. In some instances, the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction, including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction. Government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies. Compliance with the regulation is likely to be more time consuming and expensive than in the past and the government can now exert more control over the combination of two businesses. Accordingly, due to the regulation, our ability to engage in business combination transactions has become significantly more complicated, time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to our shareholders or sufficiently protect their interests in a transaction.\nThe regulation allows PRC government agencies to assess the economic terms of a business combination transaction. Parties to a business combination transaction may have to submit to MOFCOM and other relevant government agencies an appraisal report, an evaluation report and the acquisition agreement, all of which form part of the application for approval, depending on the structure of the transaction. The regulation also prohibits a transaction at an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the PRC business or assets, and in certain transaction structures, may require that consideration be paid within defined periods, generally not in excess of a year. The regulation also limits our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition, including aspects of the initial consideration, contingent consideration, holdback provisions, indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and allocation of assets and liabilities. Transaction structures involving trusts, nominees and similar entities are prohibited. Therefore, such regulation may impede our ability to negotiate and complete a business combination transaction on financial terms that satisfy our investors and protect our shareholders\u2019 economic interests.\nOur existing contractual arrangements with Sinotop Beijing, SSF and their respective shareholders may be subject to national security review by MOFCOM, and the failure to receive the national security review could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn August 2011, MOFCOM promulgated the Rules of Ministry of Commerce on Implementation of Security Review System of Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the \u201cSecurity Review Rules\u201d) to implement the Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Establishing the Security Review System for Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated on February 3, 2011 (\u201cCircular 6\u201d). The Security Review Rules became effective on September 1, 2011. Under the Security Review Rules, a national security review is required for certain mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors raising concerns regarding national defense and security. Foreign investors are prohibited from circumventing the national security review requirements by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions. The application and interpretation of the Security Review Rules remain unclear. Based on our understanding of the Security Review Rules, we do not need to submit our existing contractual arrangements with Sinotop Beijing, SSF and their respective shareholders to the MOFCOM for national security review because, among other reasons, (i) we gained de facto control over Sinotop Beijing in 2010 prior to the effectiveness of Circular 6 and the Security Review Rules; and (ii) there are currently no explicit provisions or official interpretations indicating that our current businesses fall within the scope of national security review. Although we have no plan to submit our existing contractual arrangements with Sinotop Beijing and its shareholders to MOFCOM for national security review, the relevant PRC government agencies, such as MOFCOM, may reach a different conclusion. If MOFCOM or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that we need to submit our existing contractual arrangements with Sinotop Beijing, SSF and their respective shareholders for national security review by interpretation, clarification or amendment of the Security Review Rules or by any new rules, regulations or directives promulgated, we may face sanctions by MOFCOM or another PRC regulatory agency. These sanctions may include revoking the business or operating licenses of our PRC entities, discontinuing or restricting our operations in China, confiscating our income or the income of Sinotop Beijing and SSF, and taking other regulatory or enforcement actions, such as levying fines, that could be harmful to our business. Any of these sanctions could cause significant disruption to our business operations.\nThe Security Review Rules may make it more difficult for us to make future acquisitions or dispositions of our business operations or assets in China.\nThe Security Review Rules, effective as of September 1, 2011, provide that when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition of a domestic enterprise by foreign investors is subject to the national security review by MOFCOM, the principle of substance-over-form should be applied. Foreign investors are prohibited from circumventing the national security review requirement by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions. If the business of any target company that we plan to acquire falls within the scope of national security review, we may not be able to successfully acquire such company by equity or asset acquisition, capital increase or even through any contractual arrangement.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China. Such classification will likely result in that dividends payable to our foreign investor and gains on sale of our common stock by our foreign investors may become subject to PRC taxation.\nOn March 16, 2007, the National People\u2019s Congress of China passed a new Enterprise Income Tax Law (the \u201cEIT Law\u201d), and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed its implementing rules, which took effect on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within China is considered a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as \u201csubstantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties\u201d of the enterprise.\nOn April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies (the \u201cNotice\u201d), further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation non-Chinese enterprise or group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a \u201cnon-domestically incorporated resident enterprise\u201d if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often reside in China. A resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying dividends to its non-PRC shareholders that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC or which have such establishment or place of business but the dividends are not effectively connected with such establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. Similarly, any gains realized on the transfer of our shares by such investors is also subject to PRC tax at a current rate of 10%, subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in relevant tax treaties, if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC. However, it remains unclear as to whether the Notice is applicable to an offshore enterprise incorporated by a Chinese natural person. Detailed measures on the imposition of tax from non-domestically incorporated resident enterprises are not readily available. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case.\nWe may be deemed to be a resident enterprise by Chinese tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as interest on financing proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would qualify as \u201ctax-exempt income,\u201d we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new \u201cresident enterprise\u201d classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC shareholders from transferring our shares.\nIf we were treated as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the United States and China, and our PRC tax may not be creditable against our U.S. tax.\nHeightened scrutiny of acquisition transactions by PRC tax authorities may have a negative impact on our business operations or the value of your investment in us.\nPursuant to the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises (\u201cSAT Circular 698\u201d), effective on January 1, 2008, and the Announcement on Several Issues Related to Enterprise Income Tax for Indirect Asset Transfer by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises (\u201cSAT Announcement 7\u201d), effective on February 3, 2015, issued by the SAT, if a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of or similar rights or interests in overseas companies which directly or indirectly own PRC taxable assets through an arrangement without a reasonable commercial purpose resulting in the avoidance of PRC corporate income taxes, such a transaction may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets subject to PRC corporate income tax. SAT Announcement 7 specifies certain factors that should be considered in determining whether an indirect transfer has a reasonable commercial purpose. However, as SAT Announcement 7 is newly issued, there is uncertainty as to its application and the interpretation of the term \u201creasonable commercial purpose.\u201d In addition, under SAT Announcement 7, the entity which has the obligation to pay the consideration for the transfer to the transferring shareholders has the obligation to withhold any PRC corporate income tax that is due. If the transferring shareholders do not pay corporate income tax that is due for a transfer and the entity which has the obligation to pay the consideration does not withhold the tax due, the PRC tax authorities may impose a penalty on the entity that so fails to withhold, which may be relieved or exempted from the withholding obligation and any resulting penalty under certain circumstances if it reports such transfer to the PRC tax authorities.\nAs SAT Circular 698 and SAT Announcement 7 are relatively new and there is uncertainty over their application, we and our non-PRC resident investors may be subject to being taxed under Circular 698 and SAT Announcement 7 and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 698 and SAT Announcement 7 or to establish that we or our non-PRC resident investors should not be taxed under Circular 698 and SAT Announcement 7, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations relating to the online transmission of foreign films may adversely affect our business.\nOn September 2, 2014, the SAPPRFT issued a Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of Online Foreign Audiovisual Content (the \u201cSeptember 2014 SAPPRFT Notice\u201d), which requires that operators of audiovisual websites obtain from the SAPPRFT a Film Public Screening Permit for all foreign films before they are transmitted via the Internet in China. The September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice further stipulates that before any foreign films for transmission exclusively via the Internet are purchased after the promulgation of the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice, operators of audiovisual websites must declare their annual purchasing plans with the SAPPRFT before the end of the year preceding the year of the intended broadcast and obtain the SAPPRFT\u2019s approval. The September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice also states that the number of foreign-sourced content to be purchased by an operator and transmitted via its website in a single year may not exceed 30% of the total amount of the domestic content purchased and transmitted by the same website in the previous year.\nWe rely heavily on foreign films to attract users and while the application and interpretation of the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice is uncertain, the promulgation of the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice could have an adverse impact on our business. Any requirement of a minimum ratio of domestic content to foreign-sourced content in the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice may require us to purchase more domestic content. In addition, as competing operators in China will also be required to maintain such a minimum ratio, the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice may have the effect of driving up the price for Chinese films, which could cause our content costs to increase.\nWe may be subject to fines and legal sanctions if we or our employees who are PRC citizens fail to comply with PRC regulations relating to employee share options.\nUnder the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC and the related Implementation Rules issued by the SAFE, all foreign exchange transactions involving an employee share incentive plan, share option plan or similar plan participated in by PRC citizens may be conducted only with the approval of the SAFE. Under the Notice of Issues Related to the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Listed Company (\u201cOffshore Share Incentives Rule\u201d), issued by the SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC citizens who are granted share options, restricted share units or restricted shares by an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with the SAFE or its authorized branch and comply with a series of other requirements. The Offshore Share Incentives Rule also provides procedures for registration of incentive plans, the opening and use of special accounts for the purpose of participation in incentive plans, and the remittance of funds for exercising options and gains realized from such exercises and sales of such options or the underlying shares, both outside and inside the PRC. We, and any of our PRC employees or members of our board of directors who have been granted share options, restricted share units or restricted shares, are subject to the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control, the related Implementation Rules, and the Offshore Share Incentives Rule. If we, or any of our PRC employees or members of our board of directors who receive or hold options, restricted share units or restricted shares in us or any of our subsidiaries, fail to comply with these registration and other procedural requirements, we may be subject to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations and agreements with third parties, and make most of our sales in China. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our Company, which may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nIf we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nOver the past several years, U.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China, particularly companies like ours which have completed so-called reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on our company, our business and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or not, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our company.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public announcements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that is located in China, where substantially all of our operations and business are located, has conducted any due diligence on our operations or reviewed or cleared any of our disclosure.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Unlike public reporting companies whose operations are located primarily in the United States, however, substantially all of our operations are located in China. Since substantially all of our operations and business takes place in China, it may be more difficult for the staff of the SEC to overcome the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present when reviewing our disclosure. These same obstacles are not present for similar companies whose operations or business take place entirely or primarily in the United States. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other disclosure and public announcements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d), a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public announcements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on our company and with the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public announcements has been reviewed or otherwise been scrutinized by any local regulator.\nIf additional remedial measures are imposed on the Big Four PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, in administrative proceedings brought by the SEC alleging the firms\u2019 failure to meet specific criteria set by the SEC, we could be unable to timely file future financial statements in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nOn January 22, 2014, Judge Cameron Elliot, an SEC administrative law judge, issued an initial decision suspending the PRC member firms of the \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, from, among other things, practicing before the SEC for six months. In February 2014, the initial decision was appealed. While under appeal and in February 2014, the PRC member firms of \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms reached a settlement with the SEC. As part of the settlement, each of the PRC member firms of \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms agreed to settlement terms that include a censure; undertakings to make a payment to the SEC; procedures and undertakings as to future requests for documents by the US SEC; and possible additional proceedings and remedies should those undertakings not be adhered to.\nIf the settlement terms are not adhered to, Chinese member firms of the \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, may be suspended from practicing before the SEC which could in turn delay the timely filing of our financial statements with the SEC. In addition, it could be difficult for us to timely identify and engage another qualified independent auditor to replace our independent registered public accounting firm.\nA determination that we have not timely filed financial statements in compliance with SEC requirements could ultimately lead to the delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq or the termination of the registration of our common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our common stock in the United States.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MARKET FOR OUR STOCK\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when you may want to sell your holdings.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, and this volatility may continue. Numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. In addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for our common stock may be highly volatile for specific business reasons. Factors such as variations in our revenues, earnings and cash flow, announcements of new investments, cooperation arrangements or acquisitions, and fluctuations in market prices for our products could cause the market price for our shares to change substantially.\nSecurities class action litigation is often instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nMoreover, the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, the market price for our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause the market price for our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nFurthermore, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other interests in our company at a time when you want to sell your interest in us.\nAlthough publicly traded, the trading market in our common stock has been substantially less liquid than the average trading market for a stock quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market and this low trading volume may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The trading volume of our common stock has been comparatively low compared to other companies listed on Nasdaq. Limited trading volume will subject our shares of common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock at a price that is attractive to you.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws or Nevada law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of the common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the Board of Directors without further action by the shareholders. These terms may include preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of such common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to acquire or effect a change-in-control, which in turn could prevent our shareholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain of our shareholders hold a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities.\nAs of March 28, 2017, Wecast Media Group Limited and affiliates (controlled by our Chairman Mr. Wu) are the beneficial owners of approximately 47.5% of our outstanding voting securities, our director Mr. Xuesong Song and C Media Limited (of which Mr. Song is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) are the beneficial owners of approximately 8.9% of our outstanding voting securities, Mr. Shane McMahon, our Vice Chairman, is the beneficial owner of approximately 8.8% of our outstanding voting securities, and Mr. Weicheng Liu, our former Chief Executive Officer, is the beneficial owner of approximately 4.2% of our outstanding voting securities (as calculated in accordance with Rule 13d-3(d)(1) of the Exchange Act). As a result, each possesses significant influence over the election of our directors and the authorization of any proposed significant corporate transactions. Their respective ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 13412, "SIC": 6200, "TIC": "IDEX"}
