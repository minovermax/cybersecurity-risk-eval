{"cik": "1382821", "company": "Redfin Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information in this Annual Report, before investing in any of our securities. The occurrence of any single risk or any combination of risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, liquidity, or competitive position, and consequently, the value of our securities. The material adverse effects include, but are not limited to, not growing our revenue or market share at the pace that they have grown historically or at all, our revenue and market share fluctuating on a quarterly and annual basis, an extension of our history of losses and a failure to become profitable, not achieving the revenue and net income (loss) guidance that we provide, and harm to our reputation and brand.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe health of the U.S. residential real estate industry and macroeconomic factors may significantly impact our business.\nOur success depends largely on the health of the U.S. residential real estate industry. This industry, in turn, is affected by changes in general economic conditions, which are beyond our control. Any of the following factors could adversely affect the industry and harm our business:\n\u2022\nseasonal or cyclical downturns in the U.S. residential real estate industry, which may be due to any single factor, or a combination of factors, listed below, or factors which are currently not known to us or that have not historically affected the industry;\n\u2022\nslow economic growth or recessionary conditions;\n\u2022\nincreased unemployment rates or stagnant or declining wages;\n\u2022\ninflationary conditions;\n\u2022\nlow consumer confidence in the economy or the U.S. residential real estate industry;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in local or regional economic conditions in the markets that we serve, particularly our top-10 markets and markets into which we are attempting to expand;\n\u2022\nincreased mortgage rates; reduced availability of mortgage financing; or increased down payment requirements;\n\u2022\nlow home inventory levels, which may result from zoning regulations and higher construction costs, among other factors;\n\u2022\nlack of affordably priced homes, which may result from home prices growing faster than wages;\n\u2022\nvolatility and general declines in the stock market or lower yields on individuals' investment portfolios;\n\u2022\nrising insurance costs that increase the expenses associated with home ownership;\n\u2022\nnewly enacted and potential federal, state, and local legislative actions that would affect the residential real estate industry generally or in our top-10 markets, including (i) actions that would increase the tax liability arising from buying, selling, or owning real estate, (ii) actions that would change the way real estate brokerage commissions are negotiated, calculated, or paid, and (iii) potential reform relating to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government sponsored entities that provide liquidity to the mortgage market;\n\u2022\nchanges that cause U.S. real estate to be more expensive for foreign purchases, such as (i) increases in the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies and (ii) foreign\nregulatory changes or capital controls that make it more difficult for foreign purchasers to withdraw capital from their home countries or purchase and hold U.S. real estate;\n\u2022\nchanged generational views on homeownership and generally decreased financial resources available for purchasing homes; and\n\u2022\nwar, terrorism, political uncertainty, natural disasters, inclement weather, and acts of God.\nOur business is concentrated in certain geographic markets. Disruptions in these markets or events that disproportionately affect these markets could harm our business. Furthermore, our failure to adapt to any substantial shift in the relative percentage of residential housing transactions from these markets to other markets in the United States could adversely affect our financial performance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our top-10 markets by real estate services revenue consisted of the metropolitan areas of Boston, Chicago, Denver (including Boulder and Colorado Springs), Los Angeles (including Santa Barbara), Maryland, Northern Virginia, Portland (including Bend), San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle.\nLocal and regional economic conditions in these markets may differ significantly from prevailing conditions in the United States or other parts of the country. Accordingly, events may adversely and disproportionately affect demand for and sales prices of homes in these markets. Any overall or disproportionate downturn in demand or home prices in any of our largest markets, particularly if we are unable to increase revenue from our other markets, could result in a decline in our revenue and harm our business.\nOur top markets are primarily major metropolitan areas, where home prices and transaction volumes are generally higher than other markets. As a result, our real estate services revenue and gross margin are generally higher in these markets than in our smaller markets. To the extent people migrate to cities outside of these markets due to lower home prices or other factors, and this migration continues to take place over the long-term, then the relative percentage of residential housing transactions may shift away from our historical top markets where we have historically generated most of our revenue. If we are unable to effectively adapt to any shift, including failing to increase revenue from other markets, then our financial performance may be harmed.\nCompetition in each of our lines of business is intense, and if we cannot compete effectively, our business will be harmed.\nWe face intense competition nationally and in each of the markets we serve for each of our businesses - residential brokerage, mortgage, title and escrow, and buying and selling homes directly. See \"Competition\" under Item 1 for a general discussion of the competitive conditions in each of our businesses.\nMany of our competitors across each of our businesses have substantial competitive advantages, such as longer operating histories, stronger brand recognition, greater financial resources, more management, sales, marketing and other resources, superior local referral networks, perceived local knowledge and expertise, and extensive relationships with participants in the residential real estate industry, including third-party data providers such as multiple listing services (\"MLSs\"). Consequently, these competitors may have an advantage in recruiting and retaining agents, attracting consumers, and growing their businesses. They may also be able to provide consumers with offerings that are different from or superior to those we provide. The success of our competitors could result in our loss of market share and harm our business.\nEach of our businesses also faces competition from potential new entrants, particularly those driven by technology. These potential competitors may have substantial financial support that allows them to offer services superior to ours. The introduction of additional competitors may also adversely impact our market share and harm our business.\nWe may be unable to maintain or improve our current technology offerings at a competitive level or develop new technology offerings that meet customer or agent expectations. Our technology offerings may also contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities.\nOur technology offerings, including tools, features, and products, are key to our competitive plan for attracting potential customers and hiring and retaining lead agents. Maintaining or improving our current technology to meet evolving industry standards and customer and agent expectations, as well as developing commercially successful and innovative new technology, is challenging and expensive. For example, the nature of development cycles may result in delays between the time we incur expenses and the time we introduce new technology and generate revenue, if any, from those investments. Anticipated customer demand for a technology offering could also decrease after the development cycle has commenced, and we would not be able to recoup costs, which may be substantial, we incurred.\nAs standards and expectations evolve and new technology becomes available, we may be unable to identify, design, develop, and implement, in a timely and cost-effective manner, new technology offerings to meet those standards and expectations. As a result, we may be unable to compete effectively, and to the extent our competitors develop new technology offerings faster than us, they may render our offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Additionally, even if we implemented new technology offerings in a timely manner, our customers and agents may not accept or be satisfied by the offerings.\nFurthermore, our development and testing processes may not detect errors and vulnerabilities in our technology offerings prior to their implementation. Any inefficiencies, errors, technical problems, or vulnerabilities arising in our technology offerings after their release could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers' and agents' access to and use of our technology and offerings.\nWe may be unable to obtain and provide comprehensive and accurate real estate listings quickly, or at all.\nWe believe that users of our website and mobile application come to us primarily because of the real estate listing data that we provide. Accordingly, if we were unable to obtain and provide comprehensive and accurate real estate listings data, our primary channels for meeting customers will be diminished. We get listings data primarily from MLSs in the markets we serve. We also source listings data from public records, other third-party listing providers, and individual homeowners and brokers. Many of our competitors and other real estate websites also have access to MLSs and other listings data, including proprietary data, and may be able to source listings data or other real estate information faster or more efficiently than we can. Since MLS participation is voluntary, brokers and homeowners may decline to post their listings data to their local MLS or may seek to change or limit the way that data is distributed. A competitor or another industry participant could also create an alternative listings data service, which may reduce the relevancy and comprehensive nature of the MLSs. If MLSs cease to be the predominant source of listings data in the markets that we serve, we may be unable to get access to comprehensive listings data on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may result in fewer people using our website and mobile application.\nWe rely on business data to make decisions and drive our machine-learning technology, and errors or inaccuracies in such data may adversely affect our business decisions and the customer experience.\nWe regularly analyze business data to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, establish budgets, and make strategic decisions. Much of this data is internally generated and has not been independently verified. While our business decisions are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring and interpreting the data, and we cannot be certain that the data are accurate. Errors or inaccuracies in the data could result in poor business decisions, resource allocation, or strategic initiatives. For example, if we overestimate traffic to our website and mobile application, we may not invest an adequate amount of resources in attracting new customers or we may hire more lead agents in a given market than necessary to meet customer demand.\nWe also use our business data and proprietary algorithms to inform our machine learning, such as in the calculation of our Redfin Estimate, which provides an estimate on the market value of individual homes. If customers disagree with us or if our Redfin Estimate fails to accurately reflect market pricing such that we are unable to attract homebuyers or help our customers sell their homes at satisfactory prices, or at all, customers may lose confidence in us.\nWe may be unable to attract homebuyers and home sellers to our website and mobile application in a cost-effective manner.\nOur website and mobile application are our primary channels for meeting customers. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to attract homebuyers and home sellers to our website and mobile application in a cost-effective manner. To meet customers, we rely heavily on traffic generated from search engines and downloads of our mobile application from mobile application stores. We also rely on marketing methods such as targeted email campaigns, paid search advertising, social media marketing, and traditional media, including TV, radio, and billboards.\nThe number of visitors to our website and downloads of our mobile application depend in large part on how and where our website and mobile application rank in Internet search results and mobile application stores, respectively. While we use search engine optimization to help our website rank highly in search results, maintaining or improving our search result rankings is not within our control. Internet search engines frequently update and change their ranking algorithms, referral methodologies, or design layouts, which determine the placement and display of a user\u2019s search results. In some instances, Internet search engines may change these rankings in order to promote their own competing services or the services of one or more of our competitors. Similarly, mobile application stores can change how they display searches and how mobile applications are featured. For instance, editors at the Apple iTunes Store can feature prominently editor-curated mobile applications and cause the mobile application to appear larger than other applications or more visibly on a featured list.\nAdditionally, our marketing efforts may fail to attract the desired number of customers for a variety of reasons, including the creative treatment for our advertisements may be ineffective or new third-party email delivery policies that make it more difficult for us to execute targeted email campaigns.\nIf we are unable to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices, whether through our mobile website or mobile application, we may be unable to attract and retain customers.\nDeveloping and supporting a mobile website and mobile application across multiple operating systems and devices requires substantial time and resources. We may not be able to consistently provide a rewarding customer experience on mobile devices and, as a result, customers we meet through our mobile website or mobile application may not choose to use our services at the same rate as customers we meet through our website.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile operating systems are released, we may encounter problems in developing or supporting our mobile website or mobile application for them. Developing or supporting our mobile website or mobile application for new devices and their operating systems may require substantial time and resources. The success of our mobile website and mobile application could also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as:\n\u2022\nincreased costs to develop, distribute, or maintain our mobile website or mobile application;\n\u2022\nchanges to the terms of service or requirements of a mobile application store that requires us to change our mobile application development or features in an adverse manner; and\n\u2022\nchanges in mobile operating systems, such as Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android, that disproportionately affect us, degrade the functionality of our mobile website or mobile application, require that we make costly upgrades to our technology offerings, or give preferential treatment to competitors' websites or mobile applications.\nOur business model of employing lead agents subjects us to challenges not faced by our competitors.\nAs a result of our business model of employing our lead agents, our lead agents generally earn less on a per transaction basis than traditional agents who work as independent contractors at traditional brokerages. Because our model is uncommon in our industry, agents considering working for us may not understand our compensation model or may not perceive it to be more attractive than the independent contractor, commission-driven compensation model used by most traditional brokerages. If we are unable to attract, retain, effectively train, motivate, and utilize lead agents, we will be unable to grow our business and we may be required to change our compensation model, which could significantly increase our lead agent compensation or other costs.\nAlso as a result of employing our lead agents, we incur costs that our brokerage competitors do not, such as base pay, employee benefits, expense reimbursement, training, and employee transactional support staff. As a result, we have significant costs that, in the event of downturns in demand in the markets we serve, we will not be able to adjust as rapidly as some of our competitors. In turn, such downturns may impact us more than our competitors. Additionally, due to these costs, our lead agent turnover may be more costly to us than to traditional brokerages. Our business may be harmed if we are unable to achieve the necessary level of lead agent productivity and retention to offset their related costs.\nReferring customers to our partner agents and our third-party partnerships may harm our business.\nWe refer customers to third-party partner agents when we do not have a lead agent available due to high demand or geographic limitations. Our dependence on partner agents can be particularly heavy in certain new markets as we build our operations to scale in those markets. Our partner agents are independent licensed agents affiliated with other brokerages, and we do not have any control over their actions. If our partner agents were to provide poor customer service, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the laws and rules to which we are subject, we may be subject to legal claims and our reputation and business may be harmed.\nIn certain markets where RedfinNow does not currently operate, we have a partnership with Opendoor whereby home sellers can request, through Redfin's website and mobile applications, an instant offer from Opendoor to purchase their home. Home sellers will have this ability to request an Opendoor offer in addition, and as an alternative, to retaining a Redfin agent to represent them during the home selling process.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into additional arrangements to refer consumers to, or partner with, third parties when we are unable or unwilling to serve those consumers directly.\nOur arrangements with third parties may limit our market share, revenue, growth, and brand awareness. For example, referring customers to third parties potentially redirects repeat and referral opportunities to those third parties. Furthermore, to the extent we enter into a new, or seek to expand operations in an existing, market where we have an arrangement with a third party, consumers may choose to continue to work with those third parties, which limits our growth. Additionally, any third-party arrangements may also dilute the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and may lead to consumer confusion or dissatisfaction when they are offered the opportunity to work with the third party rather than us.\nIf we do not comply with the rules, terms of service, and policies of MLSs, our access to and use of listings data may be restricted or terminated.\nWe must comply with an MLS\u2019s rules, terms of service, and policies to access and use its listings data. We belong to numerous MLSs, and each has adopted its own rules, terms of service, and policies governing, among other things, how MLS data may be used and how listings data must be displayed on our website and mobile application. These rules typically do not contemplate multi-jurisdictional online brokerages like ours and vary widely among markets. They also are in some cases inconsistent with the rules of other MLSs such that we are required to customize our website, mobile application, or service to accommodate differences between MLS rules. Complying with the rules of each MLS requires significant\ninvestment, including personnel, technology and development resources, and the exercise of considerable judgment. If we are deemed to be noncompliant with an MLS\u2019s rules, we may face disciplinary sanctions in that MLS, which could include monetary fines, restricting or terminating our access to that MLS\u2019s data, or other disciplinary measures. The loss or degradation of this listings data could materially and adversely affect traffic to our website and mobile application, making us less relevant to consumers and restricting our ability to attract customers. It also could reduce agent and customer confidence in our services and harm our business.\nIf we fail to comply with the requirements governing the licensing of our brokerage, mortgage, and title businesses in the jurisdictions in which we operate, then our ability to operate those businesses in those jurisdictions may be revoked.\nRedfin, as a brokerage, and our agents must comply with the requirements governing the licensing and conduct of real estate brokerage and brokerage-related businesses in the markets where we operate. Furthermore, we are also required to comply with the requirements governing the licensing and conduct of mortgage and title and settlement businesses in the markets where we operate. Due to the geographic scope of our operations, we and our agents may not be in compliance with all of the required licenses at all times. Additionally, if we enter into new markets, we may become subject to additional licensing requirements. If we or our agents fail to obtain or maintain the required licenses for conducting our brokerage, mortgage, and title businesses or fail to strictly adhere to associated regulations, the relevant government authorities may order us to suspend relevant operations or impose fines or other penalties.\nOur recently implemented pricing change may result in loss of customers and unintended financial consequences.\nPrior to December 2019, we charged home sellers in most of our markets a 1% listing fee when using our brokerage services to sell their home. For our other markets, we charged home sellers a 1.5% listing fee. The listing fee paid by a home seller was not dependent on whether the home seller also purchased a home using our brokerage services. Starting in December 2019, we changed our listing fee across all of our markets such that home sellers pay a 1% listing fee only if they both buy and sell a home with us within a year. Otherwise, a home seller will pay a 1.5% listing fee.\nThis pricing change may result in fewer home sellers using our brokerage services to list their home. As a result, our market share may decrease or grow at a slower rate or our real estate services revenue may grow at a slower rate.\nRedfinNow may overestimate the amount it should pay to purchase a home, and homes owned by it may significantly decline in value prior to being sold.\nRedfinNow uses automated valuations and forecasts in concert with our real estate knowledge to assess what a home is worth and how much to pay for its purchase. This assessment includes estimates on time of possession, market conditions and proceeds on resale, renovation costs, and holding costs. The assessment may not be accurate, and RedfinNow may pay too much for the home to realize our desired investment return. Additionally, following its acquisition of a home, RedfinNow may need to decrease its anticipated resale price for the home if it discovers a defect in the home that was unknown at the time of acquisition. This adjustment to the price may also affect our investment return on the home.\nHomes that RedfinNow owns may also rapidly lose in value due to changing market conditions, natural disasters, or other forces outside of our control. RedfinNow's geographic concentration in four states - California, Colorado, Nevada, and Texas - particularly exposes it to the factors affecting home value in those states that may not apply to the United States generally. As a result, we may be required to write down the inventory value of homes and may not be able to resell homes for more than our costs of acquiring and renovating the homes, or at all.\nRedfinNow relies, in part, on third parties to renovate and repair homes before it resells the homes, and the cost or availability of third-party labor could adversely affect our holding period and investment return for homes.\nUpon purchasing a home, RedfinNow frequently needs to renovate or repair parts of the home prior to listing it for resale. RedfinNow relies, in part, on third-party contractors and sub-contractors to make these renovations and repairs. These third-party providers may not be able to complete the required renovations or repairs within RedfinNow's expected timeline or proposed budget. Furthermore, if the quality of a third-party provider's work does not meet RedfinNow's expectations, then RedfinNow may need to engage another third-party contractor or subcontractor, which may also adversely affect its timeline or budget for completing renovations or repairs.\nA longer than expected period for completing renovations or repairs could negatively impact RedfinNow's ability to sell a home within its anticipated timeline. This prolonged timing exposes us to factors that adversely affect the home's resale value and may result in RedfinNow selling the home for a lower price than anticipated or not being able to sell the home at all. Meanwhile, incurring more than budgeted costs would adversely affect our investment return on purchased homes.\nIf Redfin Mortgage were unable to sell the mortgage loans that it originates, then it will need to service the loans itself or hire a third-party servicer, and either option could impose significant costs, time, and resources on Redfin Mortgage. Additionally, we may become more exposed to adverse market conditions affecting mortgage loans.\nRedfin Mortgage intends to sell the mortgage loans that it originates to investors in the secondary mortgage market. Redfin Mortgage's ability to sell its originated loans in the secondary market depends largely on there being sufficient liquidity in the secondary market and its compliance with contracts with investors who have agreed to purchase the loans. If Redfin Mortgage were unable to sell its originated loans, then it may need to establish a servicing platform or hire a third party to service the loans. Redfin Mortgage does not currently have a servicing platform, and establishing such a platform may result in significant costs and require substantial time and resources from its management. Additionally, Redfin Mortgage may be unable to retain a third-party servicer on economically feasible terms. As a result, Redfin Mortgage's inability to sell its originated loans may materially and adversely affect its operations and financial condition.\nRedfin Mortgage's inability to sell loans in the secondary market also exposes us to adverse market conditions affecting mortgage loans. For example, we may be required to write down the value of the loan, which reduces the amount of our current assets. Additionally, if a homeowner were unable to make his or her mortgage payments, then we may be required to foreclose on the home securing the loan. In these situations, the proceeds from selling the home may be significantly less than the remaining amount of the loan due to Redfin Mortgage. Finally, if Redfin Mortgage borrowed under one of its warehouse credit facilities for the loan, then it may be required to immediately repay the borrowed amount, which reduces our cash on hand that is available for other corporate uses.\nOur decision to expand our service offerings into new markets may consume significant financial and other resources and may not achieve the desired results.\nWe regularly evaluate expanding our brokerage and non-brokerage services into new markets. Any expansion may require significant expenses and the time of our key personnel, particularly at the outset of the expansion process. Expansion may also subject us to new regulatory environments, which could increase our costs as we evaluate compliance with the new regulatory regime. Notwithstanding the expenses and time devoted to expansion into a new market, we may fail to achieve the financial and market share goals associated with the expansion.\nWe experience variability in our financial results and operating metrics on a quarterly and annual basis and, as a result, our historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.\nWe historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability, on both a quarterly and annual basis, in our financial results and operating metrics. As a result of such variability, our historical performance, including from recent quarters or years, may not be a meaningful indicator of future\nperformance and period-to-period comparisons also may not be meaningful. The variability may be due to the other risks described in this Item 1A, certain risks that are not currently material but may become material in the future, or risks currently unknown to us.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business or result in the loss of critical and confidential information.\nCybersecurity incidents directed at us or our third-party service providers can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. Cybersecurity incidents are also constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party service providers collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our customers and employees, including personally identifiable information. Additionally, we rely on third-parties and their security procedures for the secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of information are critical to our operations. Despite measures designed to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate cybersecurity incidents, such incidents may occur to us or our third-party providers and, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption, or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties, including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees) and the disruption of business operations. Any such compromises to our security, or that of our third-party providers, could cause customers to lose trust and confidence in us and stop using our website and mobile applications. In addition, we may incur significant costs for remediation that may include liability for stolen assets or information, repair of system damage, and compensation to customers, employees, and business partners. We may also be subject to government enforcement proceedings and legal claims by private parties.\nWe process, transmit, and store personal information, and unauthorized access to, or the unintended release of, this information could result in a claim for damages, regulatory action, loss of business, or unfavorable publicity.\nWe process, transmit, and store personal information to provide services to our customers and as an employer. As a result, we are subject to certain contractual terms, as well as federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect personal information. While we take measures to protect the security and privacy of this information, it is possible that our security controls over personal data and other practices we follow may not prevent the unauthorized access to, or the unintended release of, personal information. If such unauthorized access or unintended release occurred, we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation, customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our services, and we could incur significant costs to address and fix these security incidents. These incidents could also lead to lawsuits and regulatory investigations and enforcement actions.\nWe rely on third-party licensed technology, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels.\nWe employ certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies in our technology. Our reliance on this third-party software may become costly if the licensor increases the price for the license or changes the terms of use and we cannot find commercially reasonable alternatives. Even if we were to find an alternative, integration of our technology with new third-party software may require substantial investment of our time and resources.\nAny undetected errors or defects in the third-party software we license could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our technology, delay new service offerings, or result in a failure of our website or mobile application.\nWe use open source software in some aspects of our technology and may fail to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses.\nOur technology incorporates software covered by open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and if they were interpreted, such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated restrictions on our technology. If portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in our use of such software, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies.\nMoreover, our processes for controlling our use of open source software may not be effective. If we do not comply with the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our services on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our technology to remove or replace the open source software, to discontinue the use of certain technology if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, to pay monetary damages, to make generally available the source code for our proprietary technology, or to waive certain intellectual property rights.\nWe may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our technology and methodologies, enforce our intellectual property rights, or protect our other proprietary business information.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our intellectual property and our other proprietary business information. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and contractual provisions and restrictions. However, we may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our technology and methodologies or the steps we take to enforce our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Furthermore, we may also be unable to protect our proprietary business information from misappropriation.\nIf we are unable to secure intellectual property rights, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market offerings similar to ours and we would have no recourse to enjoin or stop their actions. Additionally, any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others and invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. Moreover, even if we secured our intellectual property rights, others may infringe on our intellectual property and we may be unable to successfully enforce our rights against the infringers because we may be unaware of the infringement or our legal actions may not be successful. Finally, others may misappropriate our proprietary business information, and we may be unaware of the misappropriation or unable to enforce our legal rights in a cost-effective manner. If any of these events were to occur, our ability to compete effectively would be impaired.\nThe third-party networks and mobile infrastructure that we depend on may fail, and we may be unable to maintain and scale the technology underlying our offerings.\nWe depend on the reliable performance of third-party networks and mobile infrastructure to provide our technology offerings to our customers and agents. The proper operation of these networks and infrastructure is beyond our control, and if they fail, we may be unable to deliver our services to our customers or provide the necessary support for our agents.\nAs the number of homebuyers and home sellers, agents, and listings shared on our website and mobile application and the extent and types of data grow, our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow. Operating our underlying technology systems is expensive and complex, and we could experience operational failures. If we experience interruptions or failures in these systems for any reason, the security and availability of our services and technologies could be affected.\nOur website is hosted at a single facility, the failure of which could interrupt our website and mobile application.\nOur website and mobile application are hosted at a single facility in Seattle, Washington. If this facility experiences outages or downtimes for any reason, including human error, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, physical or electronic break-ins, terrorist attack, or act of war, we could\nsuffer a significant interruption of our website and mobile application while we implement the disaster recovery procedures we have developed to restore the function of our website and mobile application on a cloud-based hosting service. This service interruption may be extended if we discover previously unknown errors in our disaster recovery procedures.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, and our compliance with these laws, or the enforcement of our rights under these laws, may increase our expenses, require management's resources, or force us to change our business practices.\nWe are currently subject to a variety of, and may in the future become subject to additional, federal, state, and local laws. The laws include, but are not limited to, those relating to real estate, brokerage, title, mortgage, advertising, privacy and consumer protection, labor and employment, and intellectual property. These laws and their related regulations may evolve frequently and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Additionally, certain of these laws and regulations were created for traditional real estate brokerages, and it is unclear how they may affect us given our business model that is unlike traditional brokerages or certain of our services, such as Redfin Direct, that historically have not been offered by traditional brokerages.\nThese laws can be costly for us to comply with or enforce. Additionally, if we are unable to comply with and become liable for violations of these laws, or if courts or regulatory bodies provide unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations, our operations in affected markets may become prohibitively expensive, consume significant amounts of management's time, or need to be discontinued.\nData protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the United States at both the federal and state level. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\"), took effect on January 1, 2020 and has the potential to impose additional onerous privacy requirements on companies serving California consumers, including us. We will need to carefully consider the compliance mandates of the California law as well as similar state or federal laws or interpretations currently being proposed. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The burdens imposed by the CCPA and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditure to comply.\nWe are subject to costs associated with defending and resolving proceedings brought by government entities and claims brought by private parties.\nWe are from time to time involved in, and may in the future be subject to, government investigations or enforcement actions and private third-party claims arising from the laws to which we are subject or the contracts to which we are a party. Such investigations, actions, and claims include, but are not limited to, matters relating to employment law (including misclassification), intellectual property, privacy and consumer protection, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 or other fair housing statutes, cybersecurity incidents, data breaches, and commercial or contractual disputes. They may also relate to ordinary-course brokerage disputes, including, but not limited to, failure to disclose property defects, failure to meet client legal obligations, commission disputes, personal injury or property damage claims, and vicarious liability based upon conduct of individuals or entities outside of our control, including partner agents and third-party contractor agents.\nAny such investigations, actions, or claims can be costly to defend or resolve, require significant time from management, or result in negative publicity. Furthermore, to the extent we are unsuccessful in defending an action or claim, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including significant fines or damages, the loss of ability to operate in a jurisdiction, or the need to change certain business practices (including redesigning, or obtaining a license for, our technology or modifying or ceasing to offer certain services).\nAs described in Item 3, we are currently the subject of a claim alleging that we had misclassified our associate agents as independent contractors instead of employees. While we have previously settled\nsimilar complaints, there is no assurance that we will be able to settle this claim on similar terms or at all. Accordingly, this complaint may be costly to resolve, require significant time from management, result in negative publicity, or require us to change certain business practices related to our associate agents. Furthermore, we may be subject to additional lawsuits or administrative proceedings for similar claims, which may have similar negative effects on us.\nWe have also, in the past, been the subject of complaints alleging that we had improperly classified certain of our employees as exempt from minimum wage and overtime laws. The legal tests for determining overtime exemptions consider many factors that vary from state to state and have evolved based on case law, regulations, and legislative changes, as well as complicated factual analysis. We may be subject to additional complaints or administrative proceedings regarding our employee classification.\nWe may fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting as we grow our business.\nWe have established, and intend to maintain, effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. However, as our current lines of business grow or if we enter into new lines business, we may need to develop new, or revise existing, controls. Any failure to develop new, or revise existing, controls could result in our failure to maintain effective disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting. Any such failure could cause us to not meet our financial reporting obligations, require us to restate previously issued financial statements, or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial statements, even after we remedy the failure.\nSome of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage.\nWe maintain insurance to cover costs and losses from certain risk exposures in the ordinary course of our operations, but our insurance may not cover one hundred percent of the costs and losses from all events. We are responsible for certain retentions and deductibles that vary by policy, and we may suffer losses that exceed our insurance coverage limits by a material amount. We may also incur costs or suffer losses arising from events against which we have no insurance coverage. In addition, large-scale market trends or the occurrence of adverse events in our business may raise our cost of procuring insurance or limit the amount or type of insurance we are able to secure. We may not be able to maintain our current coverage, or obtain new coverage, in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Incurring uninsured or underinsured costs or losses could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow to make the payments required by our convertible senior notes, and a failure to make payments when due may result in the entire principal amount of the notes becoming due prior to the notes' maturity, which may result in our bankruptcy.\nWe are required to pay interest on our convertible senior notes on a semi-annual basis. In addition, holders of our convertible senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Furthermore, if the conditional conversion feature of our convertible senior notes is triggered, holders of our notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Upon conversion, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share).\nOur ability to make these payments depends on having sufficient cash on hand when the payments are due. Our cash availability, in turn, depends on our future performance, which is subject to the other risks described in this Item 1A. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to make the payments when due, then we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, refinancing the notes, or raising additional capital. However, we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms.\nOur failure to make payments when due may result in an event of default under the indenture governing our convertible senior notes and cause the entire $143,750,000 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to become due immediately and prior to the maturity date. Any such acceleration of the principal amount could result in our bankruptcy. In a bankruptcy, the holders of our convertible senior notes would have a claim to our assets that is senior to the claims of holders of our common stock.\nOur net working capital may be materially reduced if the conditional conversion feature of our convertible senior notes is triggered. Additionally, any conversion of our notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and depress the price of our common stock.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day preceding April 15, 2023, our convertible senior notes have a convertible conversion feature that allows holders of the notes to convert all or a portion of their notes during the times and upon any of the conditions described below:\n\u2022\nduring any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2018 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the notes on each applicable trading day;\n\u2022\nduring the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of our notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate of our notes on each such trading day;\n\u2022\nif we call any or all of our notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day prior to the redemption date; or\n\u2022\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nBetween April 15, 2023 and the close of business on the second scheduled trading day preceding July 15, 2023, holders may convert all or a portion of their notes without such conditions.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of our convertible senior notes is triggered, then we could be required under accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current, rather than long-term, liability, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes. Any such reclassification would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nUpon any conversion of our convertible senior notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, then the conversion of some or all of our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions.\nRedfinNow relies on a secured revolving credit facility to finance its purchase of certain homes. RedfinNow intends to rely on proceeds from the sale of financed homes to repay amounts owed under such facility, but in certain instances, such proceeds may be insufficient or unavailable to repay the amounts owed.\nPursuant to a secured revolving credit facility with Goldman Sachs Bank USA (\"Goldman Sachs\"), RedfinNow Borrower, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Redfin Corporation, may borrow money to partially fund purchases of homes for our properties business. RedfinNow Borrower has the option of repaying amounts owed with respect to a particular financed home upon the sale of such home and using\nthe proceeds from such sale. However, there is no assurance the sale proceeds will equal or exceed the amounts owed.\nAdditionally, in certain instances, RedfinNow Borrower may be required to repay amounts owed with respect to a financed home prior to the sale of that home. For example, the amount that RedfinNow Borrower is eligible to borrow for a home, which we refer to as the advance rate, depends, in part, on how long it has owned that home. As RedfinNow Borrower owns a home past certain time periods, the advance rate decreases and it becomes obligated to repay all or a portion of the borrowed funds. Additionally, a home must satisfy certain criteria to be eligible for financing under the facility. If a financed home ceases to satisfy the criteria, then RedfinNow Borrower must immediately repay all amounts owed with respect to the home. If either of these scenarios occur, then RedfinNow Borrower will be unable to rely on the proceeds from the sale of the home for repayment.\nIn the situations described above, RedfinNow Borrower must use its cash on hand to repay the amounts owed. To the extent it does not have sufficient cash and is unable to make the required repayments, then RedfinNow Borrower may default under the facility.\nOur inability to comply with the terms of RedfinNow's secured revolving credit facility may adversely affect our properties business and, in some instances, give the lenders recourse to Redfin Corporation when the value of the assets securing the facility are insufficient to cover the amounts owed to the lenders.\nBorrowings under our secured revolving credit facility are secured by RedfinNow Borrower's assets, including the financed homes, as well as the equity interests in RedfinNow Borrower. To the extent RedfinNow Borrower is unable to make payments when due under the facility, or it or certain other Redfin entities are unable to comply with the facility's ongoing representations and warranties or covenants (including financial covenants of Redfin Corporation), then an event of default may occur. An event of default would require RedfinNow Borrower to immediately repay all amounts owned under the facility and cause RedfinNow Borrower to be unable to borrow from the facility. As a result, our properties business will need to rely solely on our available cash to fund home purchases, and to the extent cash is unavailable, our properties business would be unable to purchase the homes required for its growth. Furthermore, an event of default may result in Goldman Sachs owning RedfinNow Borrower's equity interests or its assets, including any financed homes and cash held by RedfinNow Borrower, and result in our properties business losing a portion of its assets.\nWhile the lenders' recourse in most situations following an event of default is only to RedfinNow Borrower or its assets, Redfin Corporation has guaranteed amounts owed under the facility and certain expenses in situations involving \"bad acts\" by a Redfin entity. To the extent a Redfin entity commits a \"bad act,\" then Redfin Corporation may become obligated to pay such amounts owed or certain expenses.\nIf Redfin Mortgage is unable to obtain sufficient financing through warehouse credit facilities to fund its origination of mortgage loans, then we may be unable to grow our mortgage origination business.\nRedfin Mortgage relies on borrowings from its warehouse credit facilities to fund substantially all of the mortgage loans that it originates. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for the current terms of Redfin Mortgage's warehouse credit facilities. To grow its business, Redfin Mortgage depends, in part, on having sufficient borrowing capacity under its current facilities or obtaining additional borrowing capacity under new facilities. If it were unable to receive the necessary capacity, or receive such capacity on acceptable terms, and did not have cash on hand available, then Redfin Mortgage may be unable to maintain or increase the amount of mortgage loans that it originates, which will adversely affect its growth.\nRedfin Mortgage has historically been unable to meet certain financial covenants contained in its warehouse credit facilities. While each lender has historically waived these breaches of the financial covenants, there is no assurance that every lender will continue to do so in the event of future covenant breaches. If a lender were to enforce its remedies for a future breach, which may include the right to seize pledged mortgage loans and obtain rights and income related to the loans, then Redfin Mortgage may lose\na portion of its assets and will be unable to rely on the facility to fund its mortgage originations, which may adversely affect Redfin Mortgage's business.\nThe cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions in the agreements governing our indebtedness may result in an immediate obligation to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe indenture governing our convertible senior notes and one of our warehouse credit facilities contain cross-acceleration provisions while our secured revolving credit facility and two of our warehouse credit facilities contain cross-default provisions. These provisions could have the effect of creating an event of default under an agreement for our indebtedness, despite our compliance with that agreement, due solely to an event of default or failure to pay amounts owed under another agreement for our indebtedness. Accordingly, all or a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness could become immediately payable due solely to our failure to comply with the terms of a single agreement governing our indebtedness.\nCertain provisions in the agreements governing our indebtedness may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions in the agreements governing our indebtedness may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nFor example, the indenture for our convertible senior notes will require us to repurchase our convertible senior notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture) of us and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase our convertible senior notes and/or increase the conversion rate, which could make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in such takeover.\nFurthermore, under the loan agreement for our secured revolving credit facility, an event of default occurs upon a change in control (as defined in the loan agreement), unless Goldman Sachs, as the administrative agent, consents to the change in control. Accordingly, a takeover may require us and the third-party acquiror to obtain Goldman Sachs's consent.\nIf the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") is discontinued, interest payments under our secured revolving credit facility and certain warehouse credit facilities may be calculated using another reference rate.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. In response, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has proposed replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), which is a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements and backed by U.S. Treasury securities. The market transition away from LIBOR towards SOFR is expected to be complicated, and there is no guarantee that SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR. LIBOR is used as a benchmark rate throughout our secured revolving credit facility and certain of our warehouse credit facilities and some of these agreements do not provide fallback language for circumstances in which LIBOR ceases to be published. The transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility and illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR and may result in increased borrowing costs, the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, uncertainty under our secured revolving credit facility and certain of our warehouse credit facilities, or difficult and costly processes to amend such documentation. There remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate, and we are uncertain what impact a transition away from LIBOR may have on our business, financial results, and operations.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nProvisions of Delaware or Washington law and our governing documents could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders.\nWe are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), which prohibits a person who owns at least 15% of our common stock from engaging in a \"business combination\" (as defined in the DGCL) with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person reached such ownership threshold, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner and subject to certain exceptions. Furthermore, Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act (the \"WBCA\") may apply to us if we qualify as a \"target corporation\" under the WBCA. To the extent it applies, Chapter 23B.19 would prohibit us from engaging in a \"significant business transaction\" (as defined in the WBCA) with a person who owns at least 10% of our common stock for a period of five years following the date of the transaction in which the person reached such ownership threshold, unless the significant business transaction is approved in a prescribed manner and subject to certain exceptions. These provisions of Delaware or Washington law could, under certain circumstances, also depress the market price of our common stock.\nAs discussed in the \"Anti-Takeover Provisions\" section of the Description of Common Stock filed as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report (which we incorporate into this Item 1A by reference), certain provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the U.S. federal district courts as the exclusive forums for certain types of actions that may be initiated by our stockholders. These provisions may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \"Court of Chancery\") will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to actions arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or, as described below, the Securities Act of 1933.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation further provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the U.S. federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933. However, the Court of Chancery has ruled that exclusive forum provisions for claims under the Securities Act of 1933 are not enforceable as a matter of Delaware law. This ruling is currently on appeal in the Delaware Supreme Court. Accordingly, this exclusive forum provision in our restated certificate of incorporation is subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such provision. Regardless of whether this provision is enforceable, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.", "PERMNO": 16829, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "RDFN"}
