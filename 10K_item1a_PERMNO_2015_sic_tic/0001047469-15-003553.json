{"cik": "1313024", "company": "Venoco, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and the cost of servicing, and risks related to refinancing, that debt could adversely affect our business and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness. Those risks could increase if we incur more debt.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, in part as a result of the financing required to complete the going private transaction. At December 31, 2014, we had total outstanding debt of $840.1 million, comprised of $65.0 million outstanding on Venoco's revolving credit facility, $500.0 million of Venoco's 8.875% senior notes and $275.1 million of DPC's 12.25% / 13.00% senior PIK toggle notes. Interest obligations on our indebtedness are significant. Our debt bears interest at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 9.95% as of December 31, 2014. In 2014, we had interest expense of $87.0 million. Following the completion of our April 2015 financing transactions described in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Recent Events,\" our total outstanding debt as of April 15 is $993 million. We are pursuing a variety of measures to reduce our indebtedness, but these efforts may not be successful. If we are unable to reduce our indebtedness, or obtain additional financing, we may not have enough cash and working capital to fund our operations beyond the near term.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and certain types of transactions to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition and other investment opportunities and other general business activities;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in commodity prices, our business or the oil and gas industry;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financing flexibility than we do;\n\u2022 limit our financial flexibility, including our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022 result in an event of default upon a failure to comply with financial covenants contained in our debt agreements which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe increase in our indebtedness resulting from the going private transaction has made it more difficult for us to comply with certain covenants in our debt agreements, and we have been forced to seek multiple amendments to and waivers of these covenants from our lenders. If our cash flow and other capital resources are insufficient to fund our obligations under our debt agreements on a current basis and at maturity or if we are otherwise unable to comply with the covenants in those agreements, we could attempt to refinance or restructure the debt or to repay the debt with the proceeds from an equity offering or from sales of assets. The proceeds of future borrowings, equity financings or asset sales may not be sufficient to refinance or repay the debt, and we may be unable to complete such transactions in a timely manner, on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, our debt agreements contain provisions that would limit our flexibility in responding to a shortfall in our expected liquidity by selling assets or taking certain other actions. For example, we could be required to use some or all of the proceeds of an asset sale to reduce amounts outstanding under our debt agreements in some\ncircumstances. Any refinancing that requires the use of cash could require us to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures. In addition, following the completion of the going private transaction, there is no longer a market for our common stock, and this would likely make any equity financing transaction more difficult. There can be no assurance that any such strategies could be implemented on satisfactory terms, if at all. Further, if a default occurs under one debt agreement, this could cause a cross-default under other debt agreements. Venoco's revolving credit facility was terminated as part of the April 2015 financing transactions, thus eliminating one potential source of financing flexibility.\nWe also face a refinancing risk. Significant amounts of our indebtedness do not require current payments of principal, but are payable in full on maturity. Cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay, and may be insufficient to support any new indebtedness necessary to refinance, the outstanding balance on our debt when it matures. Global capital markets have experienced a severe contraction in the availability of debt financing in the recent past. Recent significant declines in commodity prices may have a similarly adverse effect on the availability of financing. The ability to pay principal and interest on our debt, and to refinance our debt upon maturity, will depend not only upon our financial and operating performance, but on the state of the global economy, credit markets and commodity prices during the period through the time of refinancing, many of which are factors over which we have no control. There can be no assurances that we will be able to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and to refinance our indebtedness at maturity as needed. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements, our creditors could elect to declare some or all of our debt to be immediately due and payable, our secured lenders could elect to commence foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nCommodity prices are volatile and change for reasons that are beyond our control. Decreases in the price we receive for our production adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nDeclines in the prices we receive for our production adversely affect many aspects of our business, including our financial condition, revenues, profitability, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, rate of growth, quantity and present value of our reserves, and the carrying value of our properties, all of which depend primarily or in part upon those prices. For example, due in significant part to lower commodities prices, our revenues from oil and natural gas sales and cash flow from operations declined 46% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. Declines in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas also adversely affect our ability to finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, raise capital and satisfy our financial obligations. In addition, declines in prices reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and the estimated value of that production and, as a result, adversely affect our estimated proved reserves. Among other things, a reduction in our reserves can limit the capital available to us, as the availability of many sources of capital likely will be based to a significant degree on the estimated quantities and value of those reserves.\nCommodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand. Prices have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. During 2014, the daily Brent oil spot price ranged from a high of $115.06 per Bbl to a low of $57.33 per Bbl and the NYMEX natural gas Henry Hub spot price ranged from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu to a low of $2.89 per MMBtu. In particular, the price of oil declined significantly in the last seven months of 2014, from a high of $115.06 per Bbl in June to a low of $57.33 per Bbl in December, in each case based upon the daily Brent oil spot price. The prices of oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, geopolitical factors affecting other oil producing countries, the actions of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, the level of global oil and natural gas exploration activity and inventories, the price, availability and\nconsumer acceptance of alternative fuel sources, the availability of refining capacity, technological advances affecting energy consumption, weather conditions, speculative activity, financial and commercial market uncertainty and worldwide economic conditions.\nIn addition to factors affecting the price of oil and natural gas generally, the prices we receive for our production is affected by factors specific to us and to the local markets where the production occurs. Pricing can be influenced by, among other things, local or regional supply and demand factors (such as refinery or pipeline capacity issues, trade restrictions and governmental regulations) and the terms of our sales contracts.\nThe prices we receive for our production are also affected by the specific characteristics of the production relative to production sold at benchmark prices. For example, our California oil typically has a lower gravity, and a portion has higher sulfur content, than oil sold at certain benchmark prices. Therefore, because our oil requires more complex refining equipment to convert it into high value products, it may sell at a discount to those prices. This discount, or differential, varies over time and can be affected by factors that do not have the same impact on the price of premium grade light oil. We cannot predict how the differential applicable to our production will change in the future, and it is possible that it will increase. The difficulty involved in predicting the differential also makes it more difficult for us to effectively hedge our production. Many of our hedging arrangements are based on benchmark prices and therefore do not protect us from adverse changes in the differential applicable to our production.\nOur planned operations will require additional capital that may not be available.\nOur business is capital intensive, and requires substantial expenditures to maintain currently producing wells, to make the acquisitions and/or conduct the exploration, exploitation and development activities necessary to replace our reserves, to pay expenses and to satisfy our other obligations. In recent years, we have chosen to pursue projects that required capital expenditures in excess of cash flow from operations. That fact has made us dependent on external financing to a greater degree than many of our competitors. Our substantial existing indebtedness increases the risk that external financing will not be available to us when needed. Our ability to incur additional indebtedness is limited under the terms of our debt agreements. In addition, DPC has caused and may continue to cause Venoco to pay dividends to it in order to allow it to pay cash interest on its senior notes. If we reduce our capital spending in an effort to conserve cash or to facilitate the payment of dividends from Venoco to DPC, this would likely result in production being lower than anticipated, and could result in reduced revenues, cash flow from operations and income, any of which could result in a breach of our obligations under our debt agreements. We have reduced our planned capital expenditures for 2015 relative to 2014, and expect this to result in a decline in production for the year.\nDPC is a holding company and is dependent on distributions from Venoco to pay its obligations on its senior notes.\nDPC is a holding company with no business operations and no material assets other than the capital stock of Venoco. All of our operations are conducted through Venoco and its subsidiaries. Consequently, DPC is dependent on dividends, distributions, loans or other payments from Venoco and, indirectly, its subsidiaries, to make payments of principal and interest in cash on the DPC 12.25% / 13.00% senior PIK toggle notes. All of DPC's direct and indirect subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, and they have not guaranteed DPC's obligations under its notes.\nThe ability of Venoco to pay dividends and make other payments to DPC will depend on the cash flows and earnings of Venoco and its subsidiaries, which, in turn, are subject to all of the risks associated with operating in the oil and natural gas industry and as discussed in this section. The ability of DPC's direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions may be restricted by,\namong other things, applicable laws and regulations and by the terms of the agreements into which they enter. If DPC is unable to obtain funds from its direct and indirect subsidiaries as a result of restrictions under their debt or other agreements, applicable laws and regulations or otherwise, DPC may not be able to pay cash interest or principal on its notes when due. The terms of Venoco's debt agreements significantly restrict it from paying dividends or otherwise transferring assets to DPC. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital Resources and Requirements\" for a discussion of certain relevant terms of Venoco's debt agreements. We cannot assure you that the debt agreements and other agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of DPC's direct and indirect subsidiaries will permit sufficient dividends, distributions, loans or other payments necessary to provide DPC with sufficient funds to pay cash interest or principal on DPC's senior notes when due. In addition, under certain circumstances, legal restrictions may limit DPC's ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), DPC's Delaware-incorporated subsidiaries may only make dividends (i) out of their \"surplus\" as defined in the DGCL or (ii) if there is no such surplus, out of their net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Under fraudulent transfer laws, DPC's subsidiaries may not pay dividends if the relevant entity is insolvent or is rendered insolvent as a result of the dividend. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. There can be no assurance that Venoco will not become insolvent and that it will be permitted to make distributions in the future in compliance with these restrictions in amounts needed to service DPC's indebtedness. Venoco has no plans to pay cash dividends to DPC for the foreseeable future.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or the relevant underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantity and present value of our reserves.\nThe reserve data included in this report represent estimates only. Estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various estimates, including estimates based upon assumptions relating to economic factors, such as future commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes and availability of capital, estimates of required capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental regulation. The assumptions underlying our estimates of our proved reserves could prove to be inaccurate, and any significant inaccuracy could materially affect, among other things, future estimates of our reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to our properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of our future net cash flows.\nAdditionally, SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be recorded if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This rule has limited and may continue to limit our ability to record additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year timeframe.\nAt December 31, 2014, 31% of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and 3% were proved developed non-producing. Estimation of proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves is almost always based on analogy to existing wells as contrasted with the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Revenues from estimated proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves will not be realized until sometime in the future, if at all.\nYou should not assume that the present values referred to in this report represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The actual prices we receive for our production, the timing and success of the production and the expenses related to the development of oil and natural gas properties, each of which is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, will affect the timing and amount of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. In addition, our PV-10 estimates are based on assumed future prices and costs. Because market prices for oil at the end of 2014 were significantly lower than the assumed future prices for the year determined under SEC rules, the estimated quantity and present values of our reserves presented in this report are higher than they would be if we had used year-end oil prices instead. Moreover, the lower year-end prices may be more reflective of future economic conditions. Further, the effect of derivative instruments is not reflected in these assumed prices. Also, the use of a 10% discount factor to calculate PV-10 may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject.\nOil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities may not be successful and could result in a complete loss of a significant investment.\nExploration, exploitation and development activities are subject to many risks. For example, new wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. Similarly, previously producing wells that are returned to production after a period of being shut in may not produce at levels that justify the expenditures made to bring the wells back on line. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry holes but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. Moreover, even commercial wells may be less productive or more expensive than we expect and production from those wells may decline faster than we project. Even when properly used, the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically. In addition, the cost of exploration, exploitation and development activities is subject to numerous uncertainties, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our exploration, exploitation and development activities may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022 title problems;\n\u2022 problems in delivery of our oil and natural gas to market;\n\u2022 pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022 equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022 reductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022 compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements, including with respect to permitting issues; and\n\u2022 costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment, qualified personnel and services.\nDry holes and other unsuccessful or uneconomic exploration, exploitation and development activities adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition, and can adversely affect our reserves.\nDrilling results in emerging plays, such as the onshore Monterey shale, are subject to heightened risks.\nOur drilling results in emerging areas are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and producing. Because emerging plays have limited or no production history, our ability to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results is limited. In addition, part of our drilling strategy to maximize recoveries from the onshore Monterey shale formation may involve drilling and/or completion techniques that have proven to be successful in other shale formations. These drilling and completion strategies and techniques may require greater amounts of capital investment than those used in more established plays. The ultimate success of these drilling and completion strategies and techniques will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established. To date, we have established commercial production from the onshore Monterey shale formation only on a very limited basis, in part due to differences in the geology of the onshore Monterey relative to some other shale formations. If drilling success rates or production are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations or other operational problems, the value of our position in the affected area will decline, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will be adversely impacted and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon gathering systems, transportation facilities and processing facilities that we do not control. When these facilities or systems are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, processing facilities and related infrastructure and services owned by third parties. In general, we do not control these assets or services and our access to them may be limited or denied due to circumstances beyond our control. A significant disruption in the availability of these assets or services could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market the oil and natural gas we produce and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. In some cases, our ability to deliver to market our oil and natural gas is dependent upon coordination among third parties who own or provide facilities or services we use, and any inability or unwillingness of those parties to coordinate efficiently could also interrupt our operations. These are risks for which we generally do not maintain insurance.\nOur hedging arrangements involve credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases, result in financial losses or reduce our income.\nTo reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations, we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a substantial portion of our production. See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a summary of our hedging activity. Hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022 production is less than expected;\n\u2022 a counterparty to a hedging contract fails to perform under the contract; or\n\u2022 there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging contract and the actual prices received.\nA significant percentage of our cash flow in some prior periods resulted from payments made to us by our hedge counterparties. If hedge counterparties are unable to make payments to us under our hedging arrangements, our results of operation, financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected. In addition, the uncertainties associated with our hedging programs are greater than those of many of our competitors because the price of the heavy oil that we produce in California is subject to risks that are in addition to the price risk associated with premium grade light oil produced by many of\nour competitors. Also, our working capital could be impacted if we enter into derivative arrangements that require cash collateral and commodity prices subsequently change in a manner adverse to us. The obligation to post cash or other collateral could, if imposed, adversely affect our liquidity.\nMoreover, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial realized and unrealized losses relating to our hedging arrangements. Realized commodity derivative gains or losses represent the difference between the strike prices set forth in hedging contracts settled during the relevant period and the ultimate settlement prices. We incur a realized commodity derivative loss when a contract is settled at a price above the strike price. Losses of this type reflect the limit our hedging arrangements impose on the benefits we would otherwise have received from an increase in the price of oil or natural gas during the period. Unrealized commodity derivative gains and losses represent the change in the fair value of our open derivative contracts from period to period. We incur an unrealized commodity derivative loss when the futures price used to estimate the fair value of a contract at the end of the period rises. We may experience more volatility in our commodity derivative gains and losses than many of our competitors because we do not designate our derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and because we hedge a larger percentage of our production than some of our competitors.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner and feasibility of doing business and limit our growth.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to exploration for, and the exploitation, development, production and transportation of, oil and natural gas, as well as environmental, safety and other matters. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations applicable to us include those relating to:\n\u2022 land use restrictions, which are particularly strict along the coast of southern California where many of our operations are located;\n\u2022 drilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements;\n\u2022 spacing of wells;\n\u2022 emissions into the air;\n\u2022 unitization and pooling of properties;\n\u2022 habitat and endangered species protection;\n\u2022 the management and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials;\n\u2022 the use of underground storage tanks;\n\u2022 transportation and drilling permits;\n\u2022 the use of underground injection wells, which affects the disposal of water from our wells;\n\u2022 safety precautions;\n\u2022 hydraulic fracturing (including limitations on the use of this technology);\n\u2022 the prevention of oil spills;\n\u2022 the closure of production facilities;\n\u2022 operational reporting; and\n\u2022 taxation and royalties.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for:\n\u2022 personal injuries;\n\u2022 property and natural resource damages;\n\u2022 releases or discharges of hazardous materials;\n\u2022 well reclamation costs;\n\u2022 oil spill clean-up costs;\n\u2022 other remediation and clean-up costs;\n\u2022 plugging and abandonment costs, which may be particularly high in the case of offshore facilities;\n\u2022 governmental sanctions, such as fines and penalties; and\n\u2022 other environmental damages.\nAny noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative, civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities, including suspension or termination of operations. We were, until recently, a defendant in a series of lawsuits alleging, among other things, that air, soil and water contamination from the oil and natural gas facility at our Beverly Hills field caused the plaintiffs to develop cancer or other diseases or to sustain related injuries. Similar suits and/or related indemnity claims in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Moreover, compliance with applicable laws and regulations could require us to delay, curtail or terminate existing or planned operations.\nSome environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability. Strict liability means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for clean-up costs and other damages as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred and without negligence on our part or for the conduct of prior operators of properties we have acquired or other third parties, including, in some circumstances, operators of properties in which we have an interest and parties that provide transportation services for us. Similarly, some environmental laws and regulations impose joint and several liability, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of a particular reclamation or other obligation, and potentially the entire obligation, where other parties were involved in the activity giving rise to the liability. In addition, we may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example by installing and maintaining pollution control devices. Similarly, our plugging and abandonment obligations will be substantial and may be more than our estimates. Compliance costs are relatively high for us because many of our properties are located offshore California and in other environmentally sensitive areas and because California environmental laws and regulations generally are very strict. It is not possible for us to estimate reliably the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters, but they will be material. Environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.\nChanges in applicable laws and regulations could increase our costs, reduce demand for our production, impede our ability to conduct operations or have other adverse effects on our business. In particular, zoning changes related to the processing facility for the South Ellwood field could prohibit continued use of the facility.\nFuture changes in the laws and regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult or expensive to conduct our operations and may have other adverse effects on us. Examples of changes in laws and regulations that may affect us adversely include the following:\nZoning. Venoco's Ellwood Onshore Facility (\"EOF\") is located in the City of Goleta, Santa Barbara County, California. The EOF removes water and gas from crude oil produced from Venoco's platform Holly before it is transported by pipeline to market. The EOF is zoned as a legal non-conforming use because, in 1991, after the EOF was constructed, the County of Santa Barbara rezoned the property for recreational uses. In January 2015, the Goleta City Council passed an ordinance establishing procedures and guidelines for the termination of nonconforming uses. Under the ordinance, the Goleta City Council could hold a hearing and, after considering certain factors specified in the ordinance, order the termination of the nonconforming use within five years. We expect that the EOF would be the subject of such a hearing. If so, and if a termination order were entered, Venoco could then apply for a modification of the order to extend the date by which the nonconforming use for the EOF must cease up to an additional 15 years. However, there can be no assurance that such a modification would be granted, or that any legal challenge Venoco might bring regarding the ordinance or its implementation would be successful. If the EOF is terminated, Venoco would have to find an economical alternative to processing crude oil at the EOF or stop producing crude oil from platform Holly. Any alternative processing arrangement would likely entail increased costs, and these costs could be material. Venoco and the City of Goleta have entered into a tolling agreement to give the parties time to gather information and determine whether a negotiated settlement of the dispute is feasible. If Venoco is prevented from using the EOF, this could have a material adverse effect on our production, reserves, cash flows and liquidity.\nGreenhouse Gases. The EPA has issued a notice of finding and determination that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\"GHGs\") present an endangerment to human health and the environment, which allows EPA to begin regulating GHG emissions under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. EPA has begun to implement GHG-related reporting and permitting rules, with which we are complying. Similarly, the U.S. Congress has considered and may in the future consider \"cap and trade\" legislation that would establish an economy-wide cap on emissions of GHGs in the United States and would require most sources of GHG emissions to obtain GHG emission \"allowances\" corresponding to their annual emissions of GHGs. On September 27, 2006, California's governor signed into law Assembly Bill (AB) 32, known as the \"California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006,\" which established a statewide cap on GHGs designed to reduce the state's GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and establishes a cap and trade program. The California Air Resources Board adopted cap and trade regulations that went into effect on January 1, 2012. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs would likely require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our production.\nIn Spring 2014, EPA issued five \"Methane White Papers\" exploring methane emissions from, and possible controls for, various aspects of the oil and natural gas production process. Building on these white papers, in January 2015, EPA announced a comprehensive strategy to further reduce methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas industry, as part of the Obama Administration's overall GHG reduction strategy. Proposed rules governing methane emission reductions are expected in 2015, with final rules expected in 2016. The California Air Resources Board also is working on a rulemaking to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas production, processing, storage, and well stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing). While it is difficult to predict the substance of such rules, they likely\nwill include additional control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements focused on fugitive methane emissions for much of the oil and natural gas industry.\nHydraulic Fracturing. We have on occasion in the past engaged in activities involving the use of hydraulic fracturing, and could use hydraulic fracturing in the future. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that creates a fracture extending from the well bore in a rock formation to enable oil or natural gas to move more easily through the rock to a production well. Fractures typically are created through the injection of water and chemicals into the rock formation. Several federal entities, including the EPA, have recently asserted potential regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing, and the EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, with the results of the study anticipated to be available for review in 2015. Moreover, the EPA also is studying the potential impact of wastewater derived from hydraulic fracturing activities, and in early 2015 plans to propose standards that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant. Other federal agencies have examined and are continuing to examine hydraulic fracturing, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the White House Council for Environmental Quality.\nOn March 20, 2015 the BLM released a final rule that will regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators to: (i) submit detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, the depths of all usable water, estimated volume of fluid to be used, and estimated direction and length of fractures, to the BLM before hydraulically fracturing an existing well; (ii) design and implement a casing and cementing program that follows best practices and meets performance standards to protect and isolate \"usable\" water; (iii) monitor cementing operations during well construction; (iv) take remedial action if there are indications of inadequate cementing, and demonstrate to the BLM that the remedial action was successful; (v) perform a successful mechanical integrity test prior to the hydraulic fracturing operation; (vi) monitor annulus pressure during a hydraulic fracturing operation; (vii) manage recovered fluids in rigid enclosed, covered or netted and screened above-ground storage tanks, with very limited exceptions that must be approved on a case-by-case basis; (viii) disclose the chemicals used to the BLM and the public, with limited exceptions for material demonstrated to be trade secrets; and (ix) provide documentation of all of the above actions to the BLM. In addition, Congress has considered, and may in the future consider, legislation that would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to encompass hydraulic fracturing activities. Past proposed legislation would have required hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, including disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. If such legislation is adopted in the future, it would establish an additional level of regulation and impose additional costs on our operations.\nAlso, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, requirements that could restrict or impose additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. For example, in 2011, Texas enacted HB 3328, which requires the well-by-well public disclosure of all the constituent chemicals, compounds and water volume contained in fluids used for hydraulic fracturing.\nOn September 20, 2013, California enacted Senate Bill 4, which requires the California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (\"DOGGR\") to promulgate regulations regulating well stimulation operations, including hydraulic fracturing and certain acid stimulation treatments. On December 30, 2014, DOGGR released its final regulations, which go into effect on July 1, 2015. Until then, DOGGR's interim regulations, which closely track the final regulations, will be in effect. The final regulations require operators to obtain a permit prior to conducting well-stimulation operations, notify DOGGR prior to the start of well stimulation treatments, and disclose various types of operational data, including the chemical composition of well-stimulation fluids, which will be made available on a publicly accessible website. Operators also are required to\nnotify every neighboring tenant and landowner within a prescribed distance at least 30 days prior to commencing well-stimulation operations and to test well water and surface water suitable for drinking if requested by neighboring landowners. The regulations also require operators to evaluate and test the casing, tubing, certain equipment, and cement lining of the well borehole to ensure that the well's construction can withstand hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, operators must ensure that all potentially productive zones, zones capable of over-pressurizing the surface casing annulus, or corrosive zones are isolated and sealed to prevent vertical migration of gases or fluids behind the casing. The regulations also require operators to monitor and test the well during and after hydraulic fracturing operations to verify that no well failure has occurred. Operators also are required to monitor the California Integrated Seismic Network during and after hydraulic fracturing to determine if any earthquakes of magnitude 2.7 or greater occur within a specified area around the well. If such an earthquake occurs, further hydraulic fracturing in the area is suspended until authorized by DOGGR. Our current operations do not fall within the scope of Senate Bill 4 or the interim or final regulations. However, we will continue to monitor regulatory developments in this area.\nVarious counties and municipalities around the country have passed laws restricting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing. Our operations currently are not impacted by such laws. However, there is a risk that our operations could be adversely impacted by such laws in the future, especially since our operations are located in California, which historically has been at the forefront of environmental regulation. We will continue to monitor developments in this area.\nAs of June 4, 2013, an information gathering rule adopted by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (\"SCAQMD\"), Rule 1148.2, requires well operators of onshore wells in SCAQMD's jurisdiction to notify SCAQMD before undertaking certain activities at wells, including hydraulic fracturing, and then to report information regarding chemical usage and operational data regarding those well activities. SCAQMD anticipates reviewing the information gathered under Rule 1148.2 and developing regulations if necessary to protect air quality. If SCAQMD develops regulations regarding well activities, including hydraulic fracturing, our operating costs could increase.\nPermitting. We are obligated to obtain various governmental permits and approvals to pursue our projects, and the relevant permitting and approval processes may change in ways that make them more burdensome, time-consuming and/or unpredictable. For example, following the Deepwater Horizon well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior imposed a drilling moratorium in May 2010, which delayed a planned redrill of an inactive well from Platform Gail. That moratorium was subsequently lifted for fixed-leg platforms like Platform Gail. However, additional moratoria, or similar rules promulgated by other governmental authorities, could have significant impacts on our operations in the future. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior has experienced significant delays in processing permit applications for new drilling projects. Delays in the government's permitting process could have significant impacts on the industry as a whole and our future results of operations.\nDerivatives. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Reform Act, among other things, imposes restrictions on the use and trading of certain derivatives, including energy derivatives. The nature and scope of those restrictions is in the process of being determined in significant part through implementing regulations adopted by the SEC, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and other regulators. If, as a result of the Reform Act or its implementing regulations, capital or margin requirements or other limitations relating to our commodity derivative activities are imposed, this could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our hedging strategy. In particular, a requirement to post cash collateral in connection with our derivative positions would likely make it impracticable to implement our current hedging strategy. In addition, capital, margin and business conduct requirements and limitations imposed on our derivative counterparties could increase the costs of pursuing our hedging strategy, in part because there may be fewer counterparties participating in the market and increased counterparty costs that are passed on to us.\nWe are more vulnerable to the adverse consequences of changes in laws and regulations relating to derivatives than many of our competitors because we typically hedge a relatively large proportion of our expected production and because our hedging strategy is integral to our overall business strategy.\nTax. We could also be adversely affected by future changes to applicable tax laws and regulations. For example, proposals have been made to amend federal and/or California law to impose \"windfall profits,\" severance or other taxes on oil and natural gas companies. If any of these proposals become law, our costs would increase, possibly materially. Significant financial difficulties currently facing the State of California may increase the likelihood that one or more of these proposals will become law.\nPresident Obama has made proposals that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could defer or eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves significant operating risks that could adversely affect our production and could be expensive to remedy. We do not have insurance to cover all of the risks that we may face.\nOur operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including:\n\u2022 well blowouts;\n\u2022 cratering and explosions;\n\u2022 pipe failures and ruptures;\n\u2022 pipeline accidents and failures;\n\u2022 casing collapses;\n\u2022 fires;\n\u2022 mechanical and operational problems that affect production;\n\u2022 formations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022 uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids; and\n\u2022 releases of contaminants into the environment.\nOur offshore operations are further subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, including a dependence on a limited number of gas and water injection wells and electrical transmission lines. Moreover, because we operate in California, we are also susceptible to risks posed by natural disasters such as earthquakes, mudslides, fires and floods.\nIn addition to lost production and increased costs, these hazards could cause serious injuries, fatalities, contamination or property damage for which we could be held responsible. The potential consequences of these hazards are particularly severe for us because a significant portion of our operations are conducted offshore and in other environmentally sensitive areas, including areas with significant residential populations. We do not maintain insurance in amounts that cover all of the losses to which we may be subject, and the insurance we have may not continue to be available on acceptable terms. Moreover, some risks we face are not insurable. Also, we could in some circumstances have liability for actions taken by third parties over which we have no or limited control, including operators of properties in which we have an interest. The occurrence of an uninsured or underinsured loss could\nresult in significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, maintenance activities undertaken to reduce operational risks can be costly and can require exploration, exploitation and development operations to be curtailed while those activities are being completed.\nEnhanced recovery techniques may not be successful, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our properties may provide opportunities for a CO2 enhanced recovery project, and such a project is currently being pursued at the Hastings Complex by Denbury. Risks associated with enhanced recovery techniques include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 geologic unsuitability of the properties subject to the enhanced recovery project;\n\u2022 unavailability of an economic and reliable supply of CO2, or other shortages of equipment;\n\u2022 lower than expected production;\n\u2022 longer than expected response times;\n\u2022 higher operating and capital costs; and\n\u2022 lack of technical expertise.\nIf any of these risks occur, it could adversely affect the results of the affected project, our financial condition and our results of operations. We may pursue other enhanced recovery activities from time to time as well, and those activities may be subject to the same or similar risks. In addition, as discussed in \"Legal Proceedings,\" we have been involved in a dispute with Denbury regarding certain aspects of the agreement governing the Hastings Complex project. Any further disputes or disagreements could increase the risks associated with the project or reduce its benefits to us.\nA failure to complete successful acquisitions would limit our growth.\nBecause our oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets, our future reserves, production volumes and cash flows depend on our success in developing and exploiting our current reserves efficiently and finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves economically. Acquiring additional oil and natural gas properties, or businesses that own or operate such properties, when attractive opportunities arise is an important component of our strategy. Our focus on the California market reduces the pool of suitable acquisition opportunities. Also, our substantial level of indebtedness and the lack of any market for our common stock will limit our ability to make future acquisitions. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the seller, finance the acquisition or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. If we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions, it will be more difficult to replace our reserves, and an inability to replace our reserves would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including the risk that we will discover unanticipated liabilities or other problems associated with the acquired business or property.\nIn assessing potential acquisitions, we typically rely to a significant extent on information provided by the seller. We independently review only a portion of that information. In addition, our review of the business or property to be acquired will not be comprehensive enough to uncover all existing or potential problems that could affect us as a result of the acquisition. Accordingly, it is possible that we will discover problems with an acquired business or property that we did not anticipate at the time we completed the transaction. These problems may be material and could include, among other things,\nunexpected environmental problems, title defects or other liabilities. When we acquire properties on an \"as-is\" basis, we have limited or no remedies against the seller with respect to these types of problems.\nThe success of any acquisition we complete will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to accurately assess the reserves associated with the acquired properties, future oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors. These assessments are necessarily inexact. As a result, we may not recover the purchase price of a property from the sale of production from the property or recognize an acceptable return from such sales. In addition, we may face greater risks to the extent we acquire properties in areas outside of California, because we may be less familiar with operating, regulatory and other issues specific to those areas.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits we expect from an acquisition will also depend on our ability to efficiently integrate the acquired operations with ours. Our management may be required to dedicate significant time and effort to the integration process, which could divert its attention from other business concerns. The challenges involved in the integration process may include retaining key employees and maintaining key employee morale, addressing differences in business cultures, processes and systems and developing internal expertise regarding the acquired properties. Acquisitions also present risks associated with the additional indebtedness that may be required to finance the purchase price, and any related increase in interest expense or other related charges.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe operate in a competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas, integrating new technologies and employing skilled personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be willing and able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties than our financial resources permit, and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties. Our competitors may also enjoy technological advantages over us and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future with respect to acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing our production, attracting and retaining qualified personnel, implementing new technologies and raising additional capital.\nSignificant portions of our estimated proved reserves and production are attributable to a small number of wells, and adverse events with respect to one or more of these wells could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMore than 27% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2014 were concentrated in our five largest wells, and more than 10% of our estimated proved reserves were attributable to a single well in the South Ellwood field. As a result of this concentration of reserves, any significant adverse events with respect to one or more of these wells, including those discussed elsewhere in this section, could materially and adversely affect our reserves, production, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of contractual, regulatory and other constraints that can limit our production and increase our operating costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of contractual, regulatory and other operating constraints that limit the manner in which we conduct our business. These constraints affect, among other things, the permissible uses of our facilities, the availability of pipeline capacity to transport our production and the manner in which we produce oil and natural gas. These constraints can change to our detriment without our consent. These events, many of which are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and could reduce estimates of our proved reserves.\nThe loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe our continued success depends in part on the collective abilities and efforts of our key personnel, including our executive officers. We do not maintain key man life insurance policies. The loss of the services of key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable to find, hire and retain needed key personnel in the future, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nShortages of qualified operational personnel or field equipment and services could affect our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis, increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. From time to time, there have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other field equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment has increased with the number of wells being drilled. These factors can also result in significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. From time to time, we have experienced some difficulty in obtaining drilling rigs, experienced crews and related services and may continue to experience these difficulties in the future. In part, these difficulties arise from the fact that the California market is not as attractive for oil field workers and equipment operators as mid-continent and Gulf Coast areas where drilling activities are more widespread. If there is a shortage of qualified operational personnel or field equipment and services, our profit margin, cash flow and operating results could be adversely affected and our ability to conduct our operations in accordance with current plans and budgets could be restricted.\nBecause we cannot control activities on properties we do not operate, we cannot control the timing of those projects. If we are unable to fund required capital expenditures with respect to non-operated properties, our interests in those properties may be reduced or forfeited.\nOther companies operated properties representing 31% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2014. Our ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties and their associated costs is limited. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital with respect to exploration, exploitation, development or acquisition activities. The success and timing of exploration, exploitation and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that may be outside our control, including:\n\u2022 the timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022 the operator's expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022 approval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022 selection of technology.\nWhere we are not the majority owner or operator of a particular oil and natural gas project, we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the project. If we are not willing and able to fund required capital expenditures relating to a project when required by the majority owner or operator, our interests in the project may be reduced or forfeited. Also, we could be responsible for plugging and abandonment and other liabilities in excess of our proportionate interest in the property.\nChanges in the financial condition of any of our large oil and natural gas purchasers or other significant counterparties could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 97% of our oil and natural gas revenues were generated from sales to two purchasers: Phillips 66 and Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company. A material adverse change in the financial condition of either of our largest purchasers could adversely impact our future revenues and our ability to collect current accounts receivable from such purchasers. We face similar counterparty risks in connection with other contracts under which we may be entitled to receive cash payments, including insurance policies and commodity derivative agreements. Major counterparties may also seek price or other concessions from us if they perceive us to be dependent on them or to lack viable alternatives.\nWe have been required to write down the carrying value of our properties in the past and may be required to do so again in the future.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploitation, development and exploration activities. Under full cost accounting rules, we perform a \"ceiling test.\" This test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum, or \"ceiling,\" of the book value of our oil and natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after-tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved reserves, calculated using the twelve month arithmetic average of the first of the month prices. If the net book value of our properties (reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability) exceeds the ceiling, we write down the book value of the properties. At December 31, 2008, our net capitalized costs exceeded the ceiling by $641 million, net of income tax effects, and we recorded an impairment of our oil and gas properties in that amount. We could recognize additional impairments in the future. To the extent our acquisition and development costs increase, we will become more susceptible to ceiling test write downs in low price environments.\nAll of our producing properties are located in one state and adverse developments in that state would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur properties are located primarily in California. Any circumstance or event that negatively impacts the production or marketing of oil and natural gas in California generally, or in Southern California in particular, would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Many of our competitors have operations that are more geographically dispersed than ours, and therefore may be less subject than we are to risks affecting a particular geographic area.\nWe are controlled by Timothy Marquez, who is able to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a stockholder vote.\nTimothy Marquez, DPC's sole director and CEO and Venoco's Executive Chairman, beneficially owns over 90% of DPC's outstanding common stock, and DPC owns all of the outstanding common stock of Venoco. Through his beneficial ownership, Mr. Marquez is able to control the composition of the DPC and Venoco board of directors and direct both companies' management and policies. Accordingly, Mr. Marquez generally has the direct or indirect power to:\n\u2022 elect all directors of DPC and Venoco and thereby control our policies and operations;\n\u2022 amend the bylaws and certificate of incorporation of DPC and Venoco;\n\u2022 appoint management of DPC and Venoco;\n\u2022 approve future issuances of securities by DPC or Venoco;\n\u2022 approve the payments of dividends, if any, on common stock of DPC or Venoco;\n\u2022 approve the incurrence of debt by DPC or Venoco;\n\u2022 agree to or prevent mergers, consolidations, sales of all or substantially all assets or other extraordinary transactions involving DPC or Venoco.\nMr. Marquez's ownership interest could adversely affect investors' perceptions of our corporate governance. In addition, Mr. Marquez may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that involve risks to us. For example, Mr. Marquez could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or to sell revenue generating assets. Mr. Marquez may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Also, we have engaged, and may continue to engage, in related party transactions involving Mr. Marquez. For example, in July 2011 we entered into a non-exclusive aircraft sublease agreement with TimBer, LLC, a company owned by Mr. Marquez and his wife.", "PERMNO": 91598, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "VQ"}
