RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered. If any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe are a development-stage company and have a limited operating history on which to assess our business, have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a development-stage biotechnology company with a limited operating history. Our business does not generate the cash necessary to finance our operations. We incurred net losses of approximately $20.1 million in 2016 and $7.4 million in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $69.5 million.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources to identify, acquire, license and develop our technology and product candidates, including conducting early stage research and preclinical studies, paying interest payments of our term loan and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of debt and equity securities. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations or grants. Biopharmaceutical product development, which includes research and development, preclinical studies and human clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and highly speculative process that takes years to complete and involves a substantial degree of risk. Our product candidates are in the early stages of preclinical development. We have established a preclinical proof of concept for two of our product candidates, and it may be several years, if ever, before we have a product candidate approved for commercialization. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenue will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates may receive approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, pricing, reimbursement from third-party payors, and adequate market share for our product candidates in those markets.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We will require significant additional capital to:\n\u2022 continue our research and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u2022 expand the scope of our current preclinical studies for our product candidates;\n\u2022 advance our programs into more expensive clinical studies;\n\u2022 initiate additional preclinical, clinical or other studies for our product candidates;\n\u2022 obtain, change or add additional manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022 seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies;\n\u2022 establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022 seek to identify, assess, acquire, license, and/or develop other product candidates;\n\u2022 make milestone or other payments under any license agreements;\n\u2022 seek to maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 seek to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022 make interest and principal payments of our term loan;\n\u2022 create additional infrastructure to support our operations as a public company and our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022 address any delays or issues with any of the above, including but not limited to failed studies, complex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges that require longer follow-up of existing studies, additional major studies or additional supportive studies in order to pursue marketing approval.\nFurther, the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability, it would adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are dependent on technologies we have licensed and we may need to license in the future, and if we fail to obtain licenses we need, or fail to comply with our payment obligations in the agreements under which we in-license intellectual property and other rights from third parties, we could lose our ability to develop our product candidates.\nWe currently are dependent on licenses from third parties for certain of our key technologies relating to mRNA delivery, including the licenses from UW, and CSIRO. Under the license agreement with UW, we are required pay all ongoing patent expenses. In addition, we are required to pay UW an annual license maintenance fee, certain milestone payments, and, following regulatory approval from the FDA to market licensed therapeutic products, royalty payments. Under the license agreement with CSIRO, we are required to pay annual royalties and product based royalties. No assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient revenue or raise additional financing to meet our payment obligations in the license agreements with UW or CSIRO or other license agreements we enter into with third parties in the future. Any failure to make the payments required by the license agreements may permit the licensor to terminate the license. If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain these licenses, it would halt our ability to develop our product candidates, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nWe have experienced significant operating losses since inception. We have no products approved for commercialization and have never generated any revenue from product sales. We are currently developing products based on delivery of mRNAs to correct genetic metabolic defects in the liver. The process of developing such products requires significant research and development efforts, including basic research, preclinical and clinical development, and regulatory approval. These activities, together with our general and administrative expenses, have resulted in operating losses in the past, and there can be no assurance that we can achieve profitability in the future. Our ability to achieve profitability depends on our ability to develop product candidates, conduct preclinical development and clinical trials, obtain necessary regulatory approvals and manufacture, distribute, market and sell our therapeutics. We cannot assure you of the success of any of these activities or predict if or when we will ever become profitable.\nWe require substantial additional funding to bring our planned products through clinical trials, regulatory approval, manufacturing and marketing and to become profitable. This additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit, or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nWe are currently advancing our mRNA therapeutic candidates through preclinical development. Developing our product candidates is expensive, and we expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our product candidates through clinical studies.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $15.5 million. Based upon our current expectations, we believe that our currently available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that our plans will not change or that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate, and we expect that we will require substantial additional capital, whether through the sale of equity or debt securities, entry into strategic partnerships, establishment of other funding facilities, asset sales or other means, in order to continue the research and development and conduct significant preclinical and clinical activities for our lead mRNA product candidates and to support our other ongoing activities.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 the scope, rate of progress, results and cost of our clinical studies, preclinical testing, and other related activities;\n\u2022 the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies, and establishing commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop;\n\u2022 the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;\n\u2022 competing technological developments;\n\u2022 our proprietary patent position, if any, in our products;\n\u2022 the regulatory approval process for our products;\n\u2022 the cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities; and\n\u2022 the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, and other arrangements that we may establish, including any required milestone and royalty payments thereunder.\nAny additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell, or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay, or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any product candidates or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe are dependent on technologies we license, and if we lose the right to license such technologies or we fail to license new technologies in the future, our ability to develop new products would be harmed.\nWe currently are dependent on licenses from third parties for certain of our key technologies relating to mRNA delivery, including the licenses from UW and CSIRO. Our current licenses impose, and any future licenses we enter into are likely to impose, various development, funding, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance and other obligations on us. For example, the Hybrid mRNA Technology we anticipate utilizing in developing our product candidates is based upon a multi-component nanoparticle delivery system that includes our SMARTT Polymer Technology\u00ae, which uses novel synthetic polymers we developed pursuant to an exclusive license from UW. UW may terminate the license upon delivery of a written notice of termination if we breach or fail to perform one or more of our duties under the license agreement or if we become insolvent. If our license with respect to any of these technologies is terminated for any reason, the development of the products contemplated by the licenses would be delayed, or suspended altogether, while we seek to license similar technology or develop new non-infringing technology. We may need to obtain rights to additional intellectual property, and the costs of obtaining new licenses may be high, or licenses may be unavailable. If our existing licenses are terminated, the development of the products contemplated by the licenses, including the product candidates for urea cycle disorders we are currently developing, would be delayed or terminated and we may not be able to negotiate additional licenses on acceptable terms, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may become dependent on our collaborative arrangements with third parties for a substantial portion of our revenue, and our development and commercialization activities may be delayed or reduced if we fail to initiate, negotiate or maintain successful collaborative arrangements.\nWe plan to pursue and form partnerships to accelerate the development and maximize the market potential of our mRNA delivery technology. Such potential partners may provide the financial resources, preclinical and clinical development, regulatory compliance, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities required for the success of our business. If we fail to secure or maintain successful collaborative arrangements, our development and commercialization activities may be delayed, reduced or terminated, and our revenues could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOver the next several years, we may depend on these types of collaborations for a significant portion of our revenue. The potential future milestone and royalty payments and cost reimbursements from collaboration agreements could provide an important source of financing for our research and development programs, thereby facilitating the application of our technology to the development and commercialization of our products. These collaborative agreements might be terminated either by us or by our partners upon the satisfaction of certain notice requirements. Our partners may not be precluded from independently pursuing competing products and drug delivery approaches or technologies. Even if our partners continue their contributions to our collaborative arrangements, of which there can be no assurance, they may nevertheless determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of any resulting products. Our partners may fail to perform their obligations under the collaborative arrangements or may be slow in performing their obligations. In addition, our partners may experience financial difficulties at any time that could prevent them from having available funds to contribute to these collaborations. If our collaborators fail to conduct their commercialization, regulatory compliance, sales and marketing or distribution activities successfully and in a timely manner, or if they terminate or materially modify their agreements with us, the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue such development and commercialization on our own.\nAlthough we currently do not have any such partnership agreements, in the future we may receive milestone and/or royalty payments as a result of each of such agreements. If our partner with respect to any agreement terminates the applicable agreement or fails to perform its obligations thereunder, we may not receive any revenues from the technology that we have licensed pursuant to the agreement, including any milestone or royalty payments.\nThe mRNAs and formulation components for our product candidates are currently acquired from a single or a limited number of suppliers. The loss of these suppliers, or their failure to supply us with the mRNAs and the formulation components, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe currently produce the LNPs and the polymers we need for discovery research programs and preclinical studies of our therapeutic candidates internally. We rely on a few suppliers of our formulation components, and for mRNAs, only a single supplier, TriLink BioTechnologies, LLC. We have signed long-term contracts with some of our suppliers and are currently negotiating long-term contracts with other suppliers. There can be no assurance that sufficient quantities of product candidates could be manufactured if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to supply such materials. It is possible that we may be required to switch suppliers in the foreseeable future. In such case, the process of switching suppliers may be costly and/or time-consuming for us, and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a preclinical or clinical study or commercial sales of our candidate products.\nThe mRNAs we use are highly specialized, and we do not currently have a contractual relationship with suppliers for the mRNAs other than TriLink BioTechnologies, LLC. Although we believe that there are alternate sources of supplies that could satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements with respect to the mRNAs, we cannot guarantee that identifying alternate sources and establishing relationships with such sources would not result in significant delay in the development of our product candidates. Additionally, we may not be able to enter into supply arrangements with alternative suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A delay in the development of our product candidates or having to enter into a new agreement with a different third party on less favorable terms than we have with our current suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe anticipate that we will rely completely on third parties to manufacture certain preclinical and all clinical drug supplies. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of drug product, or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our preclinical and clinical drug supplies for use in the conduct of our clinical studies, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. Our internal manufacturing capabilities are limited to small-scale production of non-cGMP material in quantities necessary to conduct preclinical studies of our product candidates. Our product candidates utilize specialized formulations with polymer and LNP components whose scale-up and manufacturing could be challenging and require specific technical expertise that we may not be able to access on acceptable terms, if at all. We also have very limited experience in such scale-up and manufacturing, requiring us to depend on a limited number of third parties, who might not be able to deliver in a timely manner, or at all. In order to develop products, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize our products, we will need to develop, contract for, or otherwise arrange for access to the necessary manufacturing capabilities. We anticipate that we will rely on CMOs, and other third party contractors, some of whom may have limited cGMP experience, to manufacture formulations and produce larger scale amounts of drug substance and the drug product required for any clinical trials that we initiate.\nThe manufacturing process for any products based on our technologies that we or our partners may develop is subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval process, and we or our partners will need to contract with manufacturers who can meet all applicable FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis. In addition, if we receive the necessary regulatory approval for any product candidate, we also expect to rely on third parties, including our commercial collaborators, to produce materials required for commercial supply. We may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate manufacturing capacity for our needs. If we are unable to obtain or maintain contract manufacturing for these product candidates, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our products.\nTo the extent that we enter into manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we will depend on these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner and consistent with regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and quality assurance. The failure of a third-party manufacturer to perform its obligations as expected could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022 we may not be able to initiate or continue preclinical and clinical trials of products that are under development;\n\u2022 we may need to repeat pivotal clinical trials;\n\u2022 we may be delayed in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for our product candidates;\n\u2022 we may lose the cooperation of our collaborators;\n\u2022 our products could be the subject of inspections by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 we may be required to cease distribution or recall some or all batches of our products; and\n\u2022 ultimately, we may not be able to meet commercial demands for our products.\nIf a third-party manufacturer with whom we contract fails to perform its obligations, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we may not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with a different third-party manufacturer, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our product may be unique to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty transferring such skills to a back-up or alternate manufacturer, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. We will also be required to demonstrate that the newly manufactured material is similar to the previously manufactured material, or we may need to repeat clinical trials with the newly manufactured material. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget. Furthermore, a manufacturer may possess technology related to the manufacture of our product candidate that such manufacturer owns independently, which would increase our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to have another third party manufacture our products.\nWe intend to rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and perform other tasks for us. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, or comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed.\nWe plan to rely upon third-party CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to monitor and manage data for our licensed ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. We have relied and expect to continue to rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we maintain responsibility for ensuring that each of our clinical trials and preclinical studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with cGMP, current good clinical practices or cGCP, and current GLP, or cGLP, which are a collection of laws and regulations enforced by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these regulations through periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities, preclinical study and clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators, preclinical study and clinical trial sites, and other contractors. If we or any of our CROs or vendors fails to comply with applicable regulations, the data generated in our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign authorities may require us to perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced consistent with cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the development and regulatory approval processes.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators or contract laboratories terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. CROs may also generate higher costs than anticipated. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates could be materially and adversely affected, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators or contract laboratories involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work replacing a previous CRO. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for marketing and commercialization and we are unable to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities on our own or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions on acceptable terms, we will be unable to commercialize successfully any such future products.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities or experience. If any of our product candidates is approved, we will need to develop internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to commercialize such products, which would be expensive and time-consuming, or enter into collaborations with third parties to perform these services. If we decide to market our products directly, we will need to commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities. If we rely on third parties with such capabilities to market our products or decide to co-promote products with collaborators, we will need to establish and maintain marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. In entering into third-party marketing or distribution arrangements, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of the third parties and there can be no assurance that such third parties will establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gaining market acceptance of any approved product. If we are not successful in commercializing any product approved in the future, either on our own or through third parties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nThe Hybrid mRNA Technology and mRNA-based drug development is unproven and may never lead to marketable products.\nOur future success depends on the successful development, by us or together with our future partners, of mRNA-based products and technologies as therapeutic agents. The scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop the Hybrid mRNA Technology and mRNA-based therapeutics are relatively new. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing drugs based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited.\nRelatively few mRNA-based therapeutic product candidates have ever been tested in animals or humans, and we are not aware of any mRNA-based therapeutic product having received marketing approval. We currently have only limited preclinical data suggesting that we can deliver mRNA molecules to hepatocytes in the liver using our Hybrid mRNA Technology, as our business plan contemplates, resulting in the intended expression of proteins to treat orphan liver diseases. In addition, mRNA-based compounds delivered using our Hybrid mRNA Technology may not demonstrate in patients the chemical and pharmacological properties ascribed to them in laboratory studies, and they may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. We may make significant expenditures developing mRNA-based therapeutics without success. In addition, our Hybrid mRNA Technology polymer-LNP-based delivery system has never been tested in humans and may not be effective. Our mRNA technology may result in unanticipated side effects that may prevent the further development of our products. As a result, we may never develop a marketable product utilizing our technologies. If we, independently or together with potential future partners, do not develop and commercialize drugs based upon our technologies, our operations will not become profitable, and we may cease operations.\nAs all of our programs are in preclinical studies or early stage research, we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be commercialized. If we are unable to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur key strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize a portfolio of novel proprietary mRNA therapeutics for the treatment of inherited orphan liver diseases through internal efforts and through those of our future strategic partnerships. Our future results of operations depend, to a significant degree, upon our and our collaborators\u2019 ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates. To date, no pivotal clinical trials of mRNA therapeutics designed to provide clinically and statistically significant proof of efficacy, or to provide sufficient evidence of safety to justify approval, have been completed. All of our product candidates are in the early stages of development and will require additional preclinical and clinical development and studies to evaluate their toxicology, carcinogenicity and optimize their formulation, management of nonclinical, clinical, and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval, obtaining adequate manufacturing supply, building of a commercial organization, and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenue from product sales. The development and commercialization process, particularly with respect to innovative products, is both time-consuming and costly and involves a high degree of business risk. Successful product development in the pharmaceutical industry is highly uncertain, and very few research and development projects result in a commercial product. Positive results obtained during early development do not necessarily mean later development will succeed or that regulatory clearances will be obtained. Our development efforts may not lead to commercialization, or even if we ultimately receive regulatory approval for any of these product candidates, we or our potential future partners, if any, may be unable to commercialize them successfully for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022 a product candidate may, after additional studies, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective;\n\u2022 a product candidate may not receive necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner, if at all;\n\u2022 competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates (or those of our future partners) obsolete;\n\u2022 a product candidate may not have a sustainable intellectual property position in major markets;\n\u2022 a product candidate may not be able to be successfully and profitably produced and marketed; or\n\u2022 a product candidate may not be accepted by patients, the medical community or third-party payors.\nIf any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy at any time or during any phase of development, we would experience potentially significant delays in, or be required to abandon, development of the product candidate.\nTo date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to identify, acquire, license, and develop our technology and lead compounds, including conducting preclinical studies and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We currently have one product candidate with a preclinical proof of concept and are currently evaluating programs for two other subtypes of urea cycle disorders for a second potential product candidate. None of our product candidates has been approved by the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority, and we do not anticipate that any of our current product candidates will be eligible to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign authorities and begin commercialization for a number of years, if ever. There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates that have entered, or may enter, research or development will ever be successfully commercialized, and delays in any part of the process or the inability to obtain regulatory approval could adversely affect our operating results. If we fail to commercialize one or more of our current product candidates in a timely manner or at all, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to attain or maintain profitability, and our financial condition and stock price may decline.\nOur data from the OTCD program is limited and may not be indicative of future results.\nWe have conducted a limited number of experiments in our OTCD program with the hyperammonemia model, and there is significant uncertainty as to whether the early results from our preclinical studies on mice will translate into a successful therapeutic product candidate. Our OTCD program may fail to reach clinical stage for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022 We have performed a limited number of experiments in the hyperammonemia model.\n\u2022 We anticipate a minimum level of OTC protein will have to be made to cure OTCD patients, but it is unclear whether the protein levels produced in mice using our OTCD program will be sufficient for the human disease.\n\u2022 It is unclear whether the doses of mRNA required to normalize ammonia and orotic acid levels in mice will translate into larger animal species and ultimately humans. Dose levels will affect the cost of the ultimate therapeutic and high dosage levels may be cost prohibitive.\n\u2022 It is unknown if the dosing frequency used in mouse studies will translate into larger animal species and humans. The dosing frequency may be inconsistent with acceptable dosing frequency for a commercial product.\n\u2022 While the OTC-encoded mRNA treatment appears to be well tolerated in mice, rats and non-human primates, it is unclear whether tolerability studies in animals will fully translate into humans which may be more susceptible to the side effects of the drug.\nThe development of our product candidates including clinical trials utilizing our technologies will be expensive and time-consuming, and if the development of our product candidates does not produce favorable results or commencement or completion of clinical trials are delayed, we and our collaborators may be unable to commercialize these products.\nOur research and development programs with respect to mRNA-based products are at an early stage. To receive regulatory approval for the commercialization of our current product candidates, or any other candidates that we may develop, extensive preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials must be conducted to demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans to the satisfaction of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities. In order to support marketing approval, these agencies typically require successful results in one or more Phase 3 clinical trials, which our current product candidates have not yet reached and may never reach. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, can take many years and has an uncertain outcome, and the historical failure rate for product candidates is high. The length of time generally varies substantially according to the type of drug, complexity of clinical trial design, regulatory compliance requirements, intended use of the product candidate and rate of patient enrollment for the clinical trials, and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical trials could significantly impact our product development costs. In addition, our clinical trials may also be delayed by the limited number of patients who have the orphan diseases we are pursuing or by slower than expected enrollment.\nA failure of one or more preclinical studies or clinical trials can occur at any stage of the development process. We or our future partners may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent the commencement and completion of clinical trials, and as a result, the receipt of regulatory approval or the commercialization of our product candidates, including:\n\u2022 preclinical tests or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or a partner may decide, or a regulator may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials, or we or a partner may abandon projects that were previously expected to be promising;\n\u2022 regulators may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022 prospective third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites may not reach an agreement with us on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022 enrollment in clinical trials may be slower than anticipated or participants may drop out of clinical trials at a higher rate than anticipated, resulting in significant delays;\n\u2022 CROs may fail to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols or meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner;\n\u2022 product candidates may have very different chemical and pharmacological properties in humans than in laboratory testing and may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways;\n\u2022 collaborators who may be responsible for the development of our product candidates may not devote sufficient resources to these clinical trials or other preclinical studies of these candidates or conduct them in a timely manner;\n\u2022 clinical trials may be suspended or terminated if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022 regulators, including the FDA, may require that clinical research be held, suspended or terminated for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 the cost of clinical trials may be greater than anticipated;\n\u2022 lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial;\n\u2022 the supply or quality of product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022 product candidates may not have the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics that delay or preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use or market acceptance, if approved.\nFurther, even if the results of preclinical studies or clinical trials are initially positive, it is possible that we will obtain different results in the later stages of drug development or that results seen in clinical trials will not continue with longer term treatment. Drugs in late stages of clinical development may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. For example, positive results in early Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials may not be repeated in larger Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials. This product candidate development risk is heightened by any changes in the planned clinical trials compared to the completed clinical trials. As product candidates are developed through preclinical to early to late stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is customary that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing and methods of administration, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. While these types of changes are common and are intended to optimize the product candidates for late stage clinical trials, approval and commercialization, such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives. Any of these changes could make the results of our planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials we may initiate less predictable and could cause our product candidates to perform differently, including causing toxicities, which could delay completion of our clinical trials, delay approval of our product candidates, and/or jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues.\nIt is expected that all of the product candidates that may be developed by us or in collaboration with future partners based on our technologies will be prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. The clinical trials of any or all of our product candidates could be unsuccessful, which would prevent the commercialization of these drugs. We currently do not have strategic collaborations in place for clinical development of any of our current product candidates. Therefore, in the future, we or any potential future collaborative partner will be responsible for establishing the targeted endpoints and goals for development of our product candidates. These targeted endpoints and goals may be inadequate to demonstrate the safety and efficacy levels required for regulatory approvals. Even if we believe data collected during the development of our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support marketing approval by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities. Further, data generated during development can be interpreted in different ways. The FDA or comparable foreign authorities conducts its own independent analysis of some or all of the preclinical and clinical trial data submitted in a regulatory filing and often comes to different and potentially more negative conclusions than the analysis performed by the drug sponsor. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates would prevent our receipt of regulatory approval, and ultimately the potential commercialization of these product candidates.\nWe in-license some of the intellectual property related to our product candidates from UW and CSIRO pursuant to the license agreements. Since our experience with our product candidates is limited, we will need to train our existing personnel and hire additional personnel in order to successfully administer and manage our clinical trials and other studies as planned, which may result in delays in completing such planned clinical trials and preclinical studies.\nSince we do not currently possess the resources necessary to independently develop and commercialize our product candidates or any other candidates that we may develop, we may seek to enter into collaborative agreements to assist in the development and potential future commercialization of some or all of these assets as a component of our strategic plan. However, our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all, or it may take longer than expected to establish new collaborations, leading to development and potential commercialization delays, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we experience delays in the completion or termination of any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to commence product sales and generate product revenues from any of our product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs and slow down our product candidate development and approval process. Delays in completing our clinical trials could also allow our competitors to obtain marketing approval before we do or shorten the patent protection period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses, which may make it difficult for us to attain profitability.\nWe expect to expend substantial funds in research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, and to manufacture and market any product candidates in the event they are approved for commercial sale. We also may need additional funding to develop or acquire complementary companies, technologies and assets, as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes. Moreover, our planned increases in staffing will dramatically increase our costs in the near and long-term.\nBecause the successful development of our product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to precisely estimate the actual funds we will require to develop and potentially commercialize them. In addition, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue, even if we are able to commercialize any of our product candidates, to become profitable.\nGene editing technology is relatively new, and if we are unable to use our technology in gene editing applications, our revenue opportunities from such partnerships will be limited.\nDelivering mRNA encoding gene editing nucleases to the liver involves the relatively new approach of gene editing, and the scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing drugs based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. Gene editing technologies have been subject to only a limited number of animal studies and clinical trials, and we are not aware of any gene editing products that have obtained marketing approval from the FDA. Gene editing in humans may cause deaths, serious adverse events, undesirable side effects, or unexpected characteristics, and if such adverse events were to occur with in vivo gene editing in humans, it could lead to a temporary or permanent cessation of clinical studies and product development in the field of gene editing, which could lead to the termination of any gene editing partnership we enter into with our collaborators. Moreover the regulatory requirements that will govern gene editing product candidates are uncertain and are subject to change. In addition, gene editing products involve new and rapidly evolving technologies that may render our products or processes obsolete or less attractive. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. If we or our potential collaborators are unable to use our delivery technology to develop commercial gene editing products, our revenue opportunities will be limited and our operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to extensive U.S. and foreign government regulations, including the requirement of approval before products may be marketed. The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time-consuming, and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nWe and the drug product candidates developed by us or in collaboration with future partners are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in, among other things, any of the following actions:\n\u2022 warning letters;\n\u2022 fines and other civil penalties;\n\u2022 unanticipated expenditures;\n\u2022 delays in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate;\n\u2022 product recall or seizure;\n\u2022 interruption of manufacturing or clinical trials;\n\u2022 operating restrictions; and\n\u2022 injunctions and criminal prosecution.\nOur product candidates, developed independently or in collaboration with future partners, cannot be marketed in the United States without FDA approval or clearance, and they cannot be marketed in foreign countries without regulatory approval from comparable foreign authority. Neither the FDA nor any foreign regulatory authority has approved any of the product candidates being developed by us based on our technologies. These product candidates are in preclinical development and will have to be approved by the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authorities before they can be marketed in the United States or abroad. Obtaining regulatory approval requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and may be subject to both unexpected and unforeseen delays, including, without limitation, citizen\u2019s petitions or other filings with the FDA, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, or that delays will be resolved favorably or in a timely manner. Specifically, neither our polymer-LNP technology nor, to our knowledge, any mRNA-based therapeutic has been approved as a human therapeutic. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. If our product candidates are not approved in a timely fashion, or are not approved at all, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, both before and after regulatory approval, we, our collaborators and our product candidates are subject to numerous requirements by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities covering, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution and export. These requirements may change and additional government regulations may be promulgated that could affect us, our collaborators or our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. There can be no assurance that neither we nor any of our future partners will be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nFailure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs could prevent the sale of product candidates based on our technologies in foreign markets, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe generally plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates in the United States, the European Union, and in additional foreign countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement for marketing product candidates based on our technologies outside the United States vary greatly from country to country. We have, and our future partners may have, limited experience in obtaining foreign regulatory approvals. The time required to obtain approvals outside the United States may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Neither we nor our future partners may be able to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or obtain required approvals could restrict the development of foreign markets for our product candidates and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nEven if regulatory approvals are obtained for our products, such products will be subject to ongoing regulatory review. If we or a partner fail to comply with continuing U.S. and foreign regulations, the approvals to market drugs could be lost and our business would be materially adversely affected.\nFollowing any initial FDA or foreign regulatory approval of any drugs we or a partner may develop, such drugs will continue to be subject to regulatory review, including the review of adverse drug experiences and clinical results that are reported after such drugs are made available to patients. This would include results from any post-marketing studies or vigilance required as a condition of approval. The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities used to make any product candidates will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by regulatory authorities, including the FDA. The discovery of any new or previously unknown problems with the product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the drug or manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the drug from the market. Marketing, advertising and labeling also will be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The failure to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements may result in fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and other adverse consequences.\nWe have used, and may continue to use, hazardous chemicals and biological materials in our business. Any disputes relating to improper use, handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time-consuming and costly.\nOur research and development operations have involved, and if continued in the future will likely continue to involve, the use of hazardous and biological, potentially infectious, materials. Such use subjects us to the risk of accidental contamination or discharge or any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specific waste products. We could be subject to damages, fines or penalties in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, these hazardous materials, and our liability could be substantial. The costs of complying with these current and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant, thereby impairing our business.\nWe are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials. We maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials. The limits of our workers\u2019 compensation insurance are mandated by state law, and our workers\u2019 compensation liability is capped at these state-mandated limits. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be directly or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022 federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022 HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022 HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022 the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022 state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology from legal challenges, infringement or alternative technologies, our competitive position may be hurt and our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nOur business is based upon the development of mRNA-based therapeutics, and we rely on the issuance of patents, both in the United States and internationally, for protection against competitive technologies. As of March 24, 2017, we own or have in-licensed 16 issued U.S. patents, 25 issued foreign patents, and over 15 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. Although we believe we exercise the necessary due diligence in the patent filings we make in connection with the patents we own or in-license, our proprietary position is not established until the appropriate regulatory authorities actually issue a patent, which may take several years from initial filing or may never occur.\nMoreover, even the established patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues. Although we believe our issued patents are valid, third parties may infringe our patents or may initiate proceedings challenging the validity or enforceability of our patents. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its claim scope, validity or enforceability. Challenges raised in patent infringement litigation we initiate or in proceedings initiated by third parties may result in determinations that our patents have not been infringed or that they are invalid, unenforceable or otherwise subject to limitations. In the event of any such determinations, third parties may be able to use the discoveries or technologies claimed in our patents without paying us licensing fees or royalties, which could significantly diminish the value of these discoveries or technologies. Responding to challenges initiated by third parties, including in response to a suit we initiate regarding infringement or other intellectual property violations, may require significant expenditures and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns.\nFurthermore, it is possible others will infringe or otherwise circumvent our issued patents and that we will be unable to fund the cost of litigation against them or that we would elect not to pursue litigation. In addition, enforcing our patents against third parties may require significant expenditures regardless of the outcome of such efforts. We also cannot assure you that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. There may also exist third party patents or patent applications relevant to our potential products that may block or compete with the technologies covered by our patent applications and third parties may independently develop intellectual property similar to our patented intellectual property, which could result in, among other things, interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention.\nIn addition, we may not be able to protect our established and pending patent positions from competitive technologies, which may provide more effective therapeutic benefit to patients and which may therefore make our products, technology and proprietary position obsolete.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property from legal challenges, infringement or alternative technologies, we will not be able to compete effectively in the drug discovery and development business.\nWe license patent rights from third-party owners or licensees. If such owners or licensees do not properly or successfully obtain, maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, or if they retain or license to others any competing rights, our competitive position and business prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe do, and will continue to, rely on intellectual property rights licensed from third parties to protect our technology. We are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to third-party intellectual property that is necessary or useful for our business. See \u201cBusiness-License Agreements.\u201d We also intend to license additional third-party intellectual property in the future. Our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications licensed to us. Even if patents issue or are granted, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue litigation less aggressively than we would. Further, we may not obtain exclusive rights, which would allow for third parties to develop competing products. Without protection for, or exclusive right to, the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or know-how, such proprietary information may be used by others to compete against us.\nIn addition to filing patents, in an effort to maintain the confidentiality and ownership of our trade secrets, know-how, and other proprietary information, we have typically required parties to whom we disclose confidential information to execute confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements. These parties include our employees, consultants, advisors, and potential or actual collaborators. We also enter into agreements that purport to require the disclosure and assignment to us of the rights to the ideas, development, discoveries, and inventions of our employees, consultants, and advisors while we employ or engage them. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached, invalidated or rendered unenforceable, and if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or know-how. The disclosure to, or independent development by, a competitor of any trade secret, know-how, or other technology not protected by a patent could materially adversely affect any competitive advantage we may have over such a competitor. Furthermore, like many companies in our industry, we may from time to time hire scientific personnel formerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities we conduct. In some situations, our confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants or advisors have prior employment or consulting relationships. Although we have typically required our employees and consultants to maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information of previous employers, we or these individuals may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other similar claims as a result of their prior affiliations. If a dispute arises with respect to any proprietary right, enforcement of our rights can be costly and unpredictable and a court may determine that the right belongs to a third party. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and techniques may inhibit or limit our ability to exclude certain competitors from the market and to execute our business strategies.\nBecause intellectual property rights are of limited duration, expiration of intellectual property rights and licenses will negatively impact our operating results.\nIntellectual property rights, such as patents and license agreements based on those patents, generally are of limited duration. Our operating results depend on our patents and intellectual property licenses. Therefore, the expiration or other loss of rights associated with intellectual property and intellectual property licenses can negatively impact our business. For example, due to the extensive time needed to develop, test, and obtain regulatory approval for our therapeutic candidates, any patents that may be issued that protect our therapeutic candidates may expire prior to or early during commercialization. This may reduce or eliminate any market advantages that such patents may give us. Following patent expiration, we may face increased competition through the entry of generic or biosimilar products into the market and a subsequent decline in market share and profits.\nOur patent applications may be inadequate in terms of priority, scope or commercial value.\nWe apply for patents covering our discoveries and technologies as we deem appropriate and as our resources permit. However, we or our partners may fail to apply for patents on important discoveries or technologies in a timely fashion or at all. Also, our pending patent applications, and those that we may file in the future or those we may license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of any patents. These applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability, and therefore we may be unable to obtain enforceable patents covering the related discoveries or technologies we may want to commercialize. In addition, because patent applications are maintained in secrecy for approximately 18 months after filing, other parties may have filed patent applications relating to inventions before our applications covering the same or similar inventions. In addition, foreign patent applications are often published initially in local languages, and until an English language translation is available it can be impossible to determine the significance of a third party invention. Any patent applications filed by third parties may prevail over our patent applications or may result in patents that issue alongside patents issued to us, leading to uncertainty over the scope of the patents or the freedom to practice the claimed inventions.\nAlthough we have acquired and in-licensed a number of issued patents, the discoveries or technologies covered by these patents may not have any therapeutic or commercial value. Also, issued patents may not provide commercially meaningful protection against competitors. Other parties may be able to design around our issued patents or independently develop products having effects similar or identical to our patented product candidates. In addition, the scope of our patents is subject to considerable uncertainty and competitors or other parties may obtain similar patents of uncertain scope.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend substantial time and money and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our therapeutic candidates.\nThe development, manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or importation of our therapeutic candidates may infringe on the claims of third party patents or other intellectual property rights. Also, the nature of claims contained in unpublished patent filings around the world is unknown to us, and it is not possible to know in which countries patent holders may choose for the extension of their filings under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or other mechanisms. The cost to us of any legal proceeding arising from a third party\u2019s assertion of intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation or defense of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace and could result in an injunction prohibiting certain activities. Legal proceedings to resolve third party claims of intellectual property infringement may also absorb significant management time. Consequently, we are unable to guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, use, offer for sale, sell or import our therapeutic candidates in the event of an infringement action or other dispute regarding intellectual property rights.\nWhile we are aware that there are third party patents having claims that may be considered relevant to certain technologies for which we plan to seek regulatory approval, we believe those patents will expire prior to the time we expect to obtain regulatory approval for our first product. The estimated expiration dates for those patents were determined according to information on the face pages of the patents, and certain factors that could influence patent term, such as patent term extension, for example, were not factored into these estimates. Accordingly, the estimated expiration dates of those patents may not be accurate and one or more of those patents may not expire before we obtain regulatory approval for an applicable technology. Owners or licensees of one or more of those patents may bring a patent infringement suit against us. If one or more of those patents are asserted against us, we expect to be able to assert a defense for a safe harbor to patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. 271(e)(1) if certain requirements are met. It is possible that (1) certain of these requirements may not be met, and/or (2) one or more of the third party patents might expire after one or more of our technologies obtain regulatory approval, and consequently we may not successfully assert such a defense to patent infringement. If we are unsuccessful in asserting a defense under 35 U.S.C. 271(e)(1), it is possible we may not prevail in defending against claims of infringement and/or challenging the validity of claims in those patents. We may not successfully develop alternative technologies or enter into agreements by which we obtain rights to applicable patents. These rights, if necessary, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nIn the event of patent infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from a third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties, or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could potentially limit our competitive advantage. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a therapeutic candidate or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement or other claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly or even prevent us from commercializing one or more therapeutic candidates.\nWe may be subject to other patent-related litigation or proceedings that could be costly to defend and uncertain in their outcome.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, we may in the future become a party to other patent litigation or proceedings before regulatory agencies, including interference, derivation, or post-grant proceedings filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or opposition proceedings in other foreign patent offices regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our therapeutic candidates, as well as other disputes regarding intellectual property rights with our potential or actual corporate partners, or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships. Post-issuance proceedings, including oppositions, are not uncommon and we will be required to defend these proceedings as a matter of course. These post-grant procedures may be costly, and there is a risk that we may not prevail.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our product candidates and delivery technologies or we could lose certain rights to grant sublicenses.\nOur current licenses with UW and CSIRO impose, and any future licenses we enter into are likely to impose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement, and other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor\u2019s rights. In addition, while we cannot currently determine the amount of the royalty obligations we would be required to pay on sales of future products, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. Therefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on drug candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our licensed and owned technologies in jurisdictions where we have not licensed or obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we may obtain or license patent protection, but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents and any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our licensed patents and future patents we may own, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our licensed and owned intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. Proceedings to enforce our future patent rights, if any, in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nMany countries, including European Union countries, India, Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under certain circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nEven if we are successful in developing and commercializing a product candidate, it is possible that the commercial opportunity for mRNA-based therapeutics will be limited.\nThe product candidates based on our technologies that are being developed are based on new technologies and therapeutic approaches, none of which has been brought to market. Key participants in pharmaceutical marketplaces, such as physicians, third-party payors and consumers, may not accept a product intended to improve therapeutic results based on mRNA mechanisms of action. Accordingly, while we believe there will be a commercial market for mRNA-based therapeutics utilizing our technologies, there can be no assurance that this will be the case, in particular given the novelty of the field. Many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of any potential products, including:\n\u2022 establishment and demonstration of the effectiveness and safety of the drugs;\n\u2022 timing of market entry as compared to competitive products and alternative treatments;\n\u2022 benefits of our drugs relative to their prices and the comparative price of competing products and treatments;\n\u2022 availability of adequate government and third-party payor reimbursement;\n\u2022 marketing and distribution support of our products;\n\u2022 safety, efficacy and ease of administration of our product candidates;\n\u2022 willingness of patients to accept, and the willingness of medical professionals to prescribe, relatively new therapies; and\n\u2022 any restrictions on labeled indications.\nIn addition, we focus our research and product development on treatments for orphan liver diseases. Given the small number of patients who have the diseases that we are targeting, it is critical to our ability to grow and become profitable that we continue to successfully identify patients with these diseases. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. The effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is in early stages, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for each of our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our products, our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions and our revenue will be reduced. In addition, if a competitor obtains orphan drug designation and is first to market for a product we are developing, it could prevent or delay us from marketing our product.\nWe currently focus on the development of drugs that are eligible for the FDA and European Union orphan drug designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product.\nIn the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. If a competitor obtains orphan drug designation and is first to market for a product we are developing, it could prevent or delay us from marketing our product.\nBecause the extent and scope of patent protection for our products may in some cases be limited, orphan drug designation is especially important for our products for which orphan drug designation may be available. For eligible drugs, we plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the Orphan Drug Act to maintain a competitive position. If we do not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our drug products and biologic products that do not have broad patent protection, our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same condition sooner than if we had obtained orphan drug exclusivity and our revenue will be reduced.\nEven though we may obtain orphan drug designation for our products in the United States, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even with orphan drug exclusivity, if a third party were to prepare or market a product which infringes upon our intellectual property, we may need to initiate litigation, which may be costly, to enforce our rights against such party. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nIf we are not able to retain our key management or attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and business personnel, our ability to implement our business plan may be adversely affected.\nOur success largely depends on the skill, experience and effort of our senior management. The loss of the service of any of these persons, including Robert Overell, Ph.D., our president and chief executive officer, Michael Houston, Ph.D., our chief scientific officer and Gordon Brandt, M.D., our chief medical officer, would likely result in a significant loss in the knowledge and experience that we possess and could significantly delay or prevent successful product development and other business objectives. There is intense competition from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and other research institutions, seeking to employ qualified individuals in the technical fields in which we operate, and we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nIf our product candidates advance into clinical trials, we may experience difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations.\nWe have limited experience in product development and have not begun clinical trials for any of our product candidates. As our product candidates enter and advance through preclinical studies and any clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. In the future, we expect to have to manage additional relationships with collaborators or partners, suppliers and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls.\nWe may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims.\nOur business exposes us to significant product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of therapeutic treatments. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials that we may initiate and for products that we sell, or manufacture for others to sell, after regulatory approval. The risk exists even with respect to those drugs that are approved by regulatory agencies for commercial distribution and sale and are manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by regulatory agencies. Product liability claims could delay or prevent completion of our development programs. If we succeed in marketing products, such claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action, limitations on the approved indications for which they may be used or suspension or withdrawal of approvals. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may also result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, costs to defend the related litigation, a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources, substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients and a decline in our stock price. We currently do not have product liability insurance. We will need to obtain such insurance as we believe is appropriate for our stage of development and may need to obtain higher levels of such insurance if we were ever to market any of our product candidates. Any insurance we have or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards we may establish, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing drugs, new treatment methods and new technologies, we may be unable to commercialize successfully any drugs that we develop.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and rapidly changing. Many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are pursuing the development of novel drugs for the same diseases that we are targeting or expect to target. Many of our competitors have:\n\u2022 much greater financial, technical and human resources than we have at every stage of the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of products;\n\u2022 more extensive experience in preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and in manufacturing, marketing and selling pharmaceutical products;\n\u2022 product candidates that are based on previously tested or accepted technologies;\n\u2022 products that have been approved or are in late stages of development; and\n\u2022 collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions.\nProducts based on our technologies may face competition from drugs that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community for the treatment of the conditions for which we may develop drugs. We also expect to face competition from new drugs that enter the market. We believe a significant number of drugs and delivery technologies are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions for which we and our partners may try to develop drugs. These drugs may be more effective, safer, less expensive, or marketed and sold more effectively, than any products we and our partners develop.\nIf we and our partners successfully develop product candidates based on our technologies, and obtain approval for them, we will face competition based on many different factors, including:\n\u2022 safety and effectiveness of such products;\n\u2022 ease with which such products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration;\n\u2022 timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products;\n\u2022 availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities;\n\u2022 price;\n\u2022 reimbursement coverage; and\n\u2022 patent position.\nOur competitors may develop or commercialize products with significant advantages over any products we develop based on any of the factors listed above or on other factors. Our competitors may therefore be more successful in commercializing their products than we are, which could adversely affect our competitive position and business. Competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates. Such competitors could also recruit our future employees, which could negatively impact our level of expertise and the ability to execute on our business plan. Furthermore, we also face competition from existing and new treatment methods that reduce or eliminate the need for drugs, such as the use of advanced medical devices. The development of new medical devices or other treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could make our product candidates noncompetitive, obsolete or uneconomical.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully against other companies that are working to develop novel drugs and technology platforms using technology similar to ours.\nIn addition to the competition we face from competing drugs in general, we also face competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and medical institutions that are working to develop novel drugs using technology that competes more directly with our own. Among those companies that are or may be working in the field of RNA therapeutics to treat orphan liver disease and/or the urea cycle disorders are: Moderna LLC, Bio Blast Pharma Ltd., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc., Acuitas Therapeutics, Arbutus Biopharma Corporation, CureVac AG, Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Horizon Pharma plc, Ocera Therapeutics, Inc., Cytonet GmbH & Co., Promethera Biosciences S.A., BioNTech AG, Synlogic, Inc. and Aeglea Biotherapeutics, Inc. Any of these, or other, companies may develop their technology more rapidly and more effectively than us.\nIn addition to competition with respect to our technology and with respect to specific products, we face substantial competition to discover and develop safe and effective means to deliver mRNAs to the hepatocytes. Substantial resources are being expended by third parties, both in academic laboratories and in the corporate sector, in an effort to discover and develop a safe and effective means of delivery into the hepatocytes. If safe and effective means of delivery to the hepatocytes are developed by our competitors, our ability to successfully commercialize a competitive product would be adversely affected.\nMany of our competitors, either alone or together with their partners, have substantially greater research and development capabilities and financial, scientific, technical, manufacturing, sales, marketing, distribution, regulatory and other resources and experience than us. They may also have more established relationships with pharmaceutical companies. Even if we and/or our partners are successful in developing products based on our technologies, in order to compete successfully we may need to be first to obtain intellectual property protection for, or to commercialize, such products, or we may need to demonstrate that such products are superior to, or more cost effective than, products developed by our competitors (including therapies that are based on different technologies). If we are not first to protect or market our products, or if we are unable to differentiate our products from those offered by our competitors, any products for which we are able to obtain approval may not be successful.\nUniversities and public and private research institutions are also potential competitors. While these organizations primarily have educational objectives, they may develop proprietary technologies related to the drug delivery field or secure protection that we may need for development of our technologies and products. We may attempt to license one or more of these proprietary technologies, but these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nAny drugs based on our technologies that we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe success of the products based on our technologies will depend upon the extent to which third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs, provide reimbursement for the use of such products. Most third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication.\nThird-party payors also may refuse to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. Furthermore, because our programs are in the early stages of development, we are unable at this time to determine their cost-effectiveness and the level or method of reimbursement. Increasingly, the third-party payors, who reimburse patients, such as government and private insurance plans, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. If the price charged for any products based on our technologies that we or our partners develop is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe expect that drugs based on our technologies that we or a partner develop may need to be administered under the supervision of a physician. Under currently applicable law, drugs that are not usually self-administered may be eligible for coverage by the Medicare program if they:\n\u2022 are \u201cincidental\u201d to a physician\u2019s services;\n\u2022 are \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d for the diagnosis or treatment of the illness or injury for which they are administered according to accepted standards of medical practice;\n\u2022 are not excluded as immunizations; and\n\u2022 have been approved by the FDA.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining insurance coverage for newly-approved drugs, and insurance coverage may be more limited than the purpose for which the drug is approved by the FDA. Moreover, eligibility for insurance coverage does not imply that any drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim payments for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement may be based on payments for other services and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health care programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. The inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for new drugs based on our technologies that we or our partners develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital, and our overall financial condition.\nWe believe that the efforts of governments and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare and legislative and regulatory proposals to broaden the availability of healthcare will continue to affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. A number of legislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare system in the United States and other major healthcare markets have occurred in recent years, and interpretation and application of such changes continue to evolve. These developments have included prescription drug benefit legislation that was enacted and took effect in January 2006, healthcare reform legislation recently enacted by certain states, and implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010 which resulted in significant changes to the health care industry. These developments could, directly or indirectly, affect our ability to sell our products, if approved, at a favorable price.\nThe Affordable Care Act includes significant provisions that encourage state and federal law enforcement agencies to increase activities related to preventing, detecting and prosecuting those who commit fraud, waste and abuse in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare. The Affordable Care Act continues to be implemented through regulation and government activity but is subject to possible, amendment, additional implementing regulations and interpretive guidelines. The manner in which the Affordable Care Act continues to evolve could materially affect the extent to which and the amount at which pharmaceuticals are reimbursed by government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare. We cannot predict all impacts the Affordable Care Act may have on our products, but it may result in our products being chosen less frequently or the pricing being substantially lowered. Or, the new legislation could have a positive impact on our future net sales due to increasing the number of persons with healthcare coverage in the United States.\nWe cannot predict what additional healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future or how federal and state legislative and regulatory developments are likely to evolve, but we expect ongoing initiatives in the United States to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates based on our technologies that are successfully developed and for which regulatory approval is obtained, and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe expect that our stock price will fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of shares of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report, these factors include:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022 announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022 the timing and results of preclinical studies for our urea cycle disorder programs and any product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022 commencement or termination of collaborations for our product development and research programs;\n\u2022 failure or discontinuation of any of our product development and research programs;\n\u2022 variance in our financial performance from the expectations of market analysts;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of results of preclinical studies, clinical trials, or regulatory approvals of product candidates, significant business developments, changes in distributor relationships, acquisitions or expansion plans;\n\u2022 adverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022 changes in the prices of our raw materials or the products we sell;\n\u2022 data concerning the safety and efficacy profile of our products;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by us, our insiders, or other stockholders;\n\u2022 expiration of market stand-off or lock-up agreements;\n\u2022 our involvement in litigation;\n\u2022 our sale of common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u2022 market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022 changes in key personnel;\n\u2022 the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022 changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\n\u2022 the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022 developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents, or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022 general economic, industry, and market conditions; and\n\u2022 the other factors described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn recent years, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, especially in the biotechnology sector. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of shares of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. If we were involved in any similar litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention and resources could be diverted.\nThe market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by future sales of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders and lenders.\nSales by us or our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of our equity securities.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 11,690,329 shares of common stock outstanding. The resale of 4,745,174 shares, or 40.6% of our outstanding shares as of December 31, 2016 is currently prohibited or otherwise restricted as a result of securities law provisions, market standoff agreements entered into by our stockholders with us or lock-up agreements entered into by our stockholders with the underwriters of our IPO; however, subject to applicable securities law restrictions, these shares will be able to be sold in the public market beginning as follows:\n\u00b7 4,290,981 shares of our outstanding shares of common stock beneficially owned by certain stockholders who are subject to lock-up agreements, each of which, subject to limited exceptions, restricts transfer of the stockholder\u2019s shares of common stock for a period of 12 months after the closing of our IPO without the prior written consent of Titan Multi-Strategy Fund I, LTD., one of the lenders from the bridge loan financing we received in December 2015; provided that, after 180 days following the IPO, the foregoing restrictions will automatically terminate if for 20 consecutive trading days on each such trading day (x) the closing price of our common stock is at least 150% of the IPO price for our common stock and (y) the trading volume of our common stock is not less than 100,000 shares; provided further that, Titan Multi-Strategy Fund I, LTD. may unilaterally waive any term of the lock-up agreement (\u201cCategory 1\u201d);\n\u00b7 454,193 shares of our outstanding shares of common stock beneficially owned by certain stockholders and option holders who are subject to lock-up agreements, each of which, subject to limited exceptions, restricts transfer of the stockholder\u2019s shares of common stock for a period of 12 months after the closing of our IPO without our prior written consent, which restriction will terminate in accordance with the same terms as Category 1; provided further that, we may unilaterally waive any term of the lock-up agreement (\u201cCategory 2\u201d);\nAs noted above, we or Titan Multi-Strategy Fund I, LTD., as applicable, may, in our or their sole discretion, and at any time without notice, release all or any portion of the shares subject to the corresponding lock-up agreements. After the expiration of the lock-up period, these shares can be resold into the public markets in accordance with the requirements of Rule 144, subject to certain volume limitations. In addition, we have also registered the offer and sale of all of the outstanding options of our 2006 Plan as of May 17, 2016 and all of the shares of common stock issuable under the PhaseRx, Inc. 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, and such shares are freely transferable, except for any shares held by \u201caffiliates,\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The market price of our common stock may drop significantly when the restrictions on resale by our existing stockholders lapse and these stockholders are able to sell our common stock into the market.\nUpon the expiration of the lock-up restrictions described above, the number of shares of our common stock that are potentially available for sale in the open market will increase materially, which could make it harder for the value of our common stock to appreciate unless there is a corresponding increase in demand for our common stock. This increase in available shares could cause the value of your investment in our common stock to decrease.\nIn addition, a sale by us of additional shares of common stock or similar securities in order to raise capital might have a similar negative impact on the share price of our common stock. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities, and may cause you to lose part or all of your investment in our common stock.\nThe concentration of the capital stock ownership with our insiders may limit the ability of the stockholders to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our executive officers, directors, 5% or greater stockholders, and their respective affiliated entities in the aggregate beneficially owned approximately 56.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have control over matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate actions might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a corporate transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of a portion of the net proceeds from our IPO and our investment of these proceeds may not yield a favorable return. We may invest the proceeds of the offering in ways with which investors disagree.\nOur management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from our May 2016 IPO in ways our stockholders may not agree with or that do not yield a favorable return, if at all. If we do not invest or apply the proceeds in ways that improve our operating results, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, which could reduce the attractiveness of our stock to some investors.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases. In addition, our loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. (\u201cHercules\u201d), dated June 7, 2016, prohibits us from declaring or paying cash dividends or making cash distributions on any class of our capital stock. See \u201cDividend Policy.\u201d Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our share price.\nAn active public trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nPrior to our IPO in May 2016, there was no public market for our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, the market for our shares has demonstrated varying levels of trading activity. Furthermore, an active trading market may not be sustained in the future. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions:\n\u00b7 authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7 prohibit stockholder action to elect or remove directors by majority written consent;\n\u00b7 provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u00b7 prohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nFinancial reporting obligations of being a public company in the United States are expensive and time-consuming, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance matters.\nAs a public company whose common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we incur significant additional accounting, legal and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with our reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other rules and regulations, implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. Following our IPO, we are working with our legal and accounting advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. These areas include corporate governance, corporate control, disclosure controls and procedures in financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. However, the expenses that will be required in order to operate as a public company are, and could continue to be, material, particularly if we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies will also require considerable time and attention of management. In addition, the changes we have made and make may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder). When these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs. In addition, once we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act and lose the ability to rely on the exemptions related thereto, depending on our status as per Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, our independent registered public accounting firm may also need to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. We will be performing the system and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) required to comply with the management certification and eventual auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when we are no longer an emerging growth company. This process will require the investment of substantial time and resources, including by our senior management. As a result, this process may divert internal resources and take a significant amount of time and effort to complete.\nChanges in the laws and regulations affecting public companies will result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. These laws and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur in order to comply with such requirements.\nIf we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board require that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and, starting with our annual report for fiscal year 2017, provide a management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. We will be evaluating our internal controls systems to allow management to report on, and eventually allow our independent auditors to attest to, our internal controls. We will be performing the system and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) required to comply with the management certification and eventual auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The aforementioned auditor attestation requirements will not apply to us until we are not an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or 2021, whichever comes first.\nWe cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or investors\u2019 confidence in us and could cause our stock price to fall. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the Securities Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources and could materially adversely affect our stock price. Inferior internal controls could also cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could seriously hurt our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nIn the event that we fail to satisfy any of the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted, which could affect our market price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. For continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we will be required to comply with the continued listing requirements, including the minimum market capitalization standard, the corporate governance requirements and the minimum closing bid price requirement, among other requirements. In the event that we fail to satisfy any of the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted. If our securities are delisted from trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market, and we are not able to list our securities on another exchange or to have them quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market, our securities could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which would require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form registration statements on Form S-3 or obtain additional financing in the future).\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and may elect to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public reporting companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d up until the December 31st following the fifth anniversary after our first equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30th, in which case we would no longer be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the following December 31st. We cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the price of our securities may be more volatile.\nEven after we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur obligations under our outstanding term loan are secured by all of our assets other than intellectual property, so if we default on those obligations, the lender could foreclose on our assets. As a result of these security interests, such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent at a time when the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our indebtedness and other obligations.\nHercules, the lender under our term loan has a security interest in all of our assets other than our intellectual property. As a result, if we default under our obligations to the lender, the lender could foreclose on its security interests and liquidate some or all of these assets, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The principal amount of the term loan as of December 31,2016, was $6,000,000.\nIn the event of a default in connection with our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization, the lender would have a prior right to substantially all of our assets to the exclusion of our general creditors. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by the lender, resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of any unsecured indebtedness. Only after satisfying the claims of any unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders. These events of default include, among other things, our failure to pay any amounts due under the loan and security agreement or any of the other loan documents, a breach of covenants under the loan and security agreement, our insolvency, a material adverse effect occurring, the occurrence of certain defaults under certain other indebtedness or certain final judgments against us.\nThe pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under the term loan, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility.\nOur outstanding term loan obligations may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business.\nPursuant to the terms of our loan and security agreement, the lender made a term loan to us in aggregate amount of $6.0 million. We are required to make monthly payments of interest in the amount of approximately $48,000 until June 2017 and monthly payments of interest and principal in the amount of approximately $225,000 per month from July 2017 until the loan matures. The principal amount of the term loan as of December 31, 2016, was $6.0 million. The term loan under the loan and security agreement, as amended, matures on December 2, 2019.\nThe terms of our term loan could have negative consequences to us, such as:\n\u00b7 we may be unable to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, operating losses, capital expenditures or acquisitions on terms acceptable to us, or at all;\n\u00b7 the amount of our interest expense may increase because our term loan has a variable rate of interest at any time dependent on the prime rate.\n\u00b7 we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will be unable to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions. We cannot be certain that we will continue to have sufficient capital to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet any other obligations. If we do not have enough money to service our debt, we may be required, but unable to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and the lender could foreclose on its security interests and liquidate some or all of our assets.\nOur loan and security agreement contains covenants that could limit our financing options and liquidity position, which would limit our ability to grow our business.\nCovenants in our loan and security agreement impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions prohibit or limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 pay cash dividends to our stockholders;\n\u00b7 redeem or repurchase our common stock or other equity;\n\u00b7 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7 permit liens on assets;\n\u00b7 make certain investments (including through the acquisition of stock, shares, partnership or limited liability company interests, any loan, advance or capital contribution); and\n\u00b7 sell, lease, license, lend or otherwise convey an interest in a material portion of our assets.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, withstand downturns in our business or take advantage of business opportunities. Moreover, additional debt financing we may seek, if permitted, may contain terms that include more restrictive covenants, may require repayment on an accelerated schedule or may impose other obligations that limit our ability to grow our business, acquire needed assets, or take other actions we might otherwise consider appropriate or desirable.", "PERMNO": 16067, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PZRXQ"}
