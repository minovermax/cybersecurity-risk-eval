{"cik": "1555365", "company": "WHITEWAVE FOODS Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn evaluating and understanding us and our business, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in conjunction with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained in Part II, Item 7. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur product categories face a high level of competition, which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition in each of our product categories. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and our ability to identify and satisfy consumer tastes and preferences. We believe that our brands have benefited in many cases from being the first to introduce products in their categories, and their success has attracted competition from other food and beverage companies that produce branded products, as well as from private label competitors. Some of our competitors, such as Groupe Danone, General Mills, Inc., Kraft Foods Group, Inc., Nestle S.A., Chiquita Brands International, Inc. and Dole Food Company, Inc. have substantial financial and marketing resources. These competitors and others may be able to introduce innovative products more quickly or market their products more successfully than we can, which could cause our growth rate in certain categories to be slower than we have forecasted and could cause us to lose sales. Our competitors also may choose to increase price promotions or may be more effective with their promotional programs, which may impact our volume growth, price realization and market shares. If we are not able to achieve the right balance between consumer and trade spending, or if our trade spending does not generate a sufficient return on investment, we may experience loss of market share or decreased profitability.\nWe also compete, particularly in our premium dairy and organic salads, fruits and vegetables categories, with producers of non-organic products, which usually have lower production costs. As a result, non-organic producers may be able to offer conventional products to customer at lower costs than organic products. This could cause us to lower our prices, resulting in lower profitability or, in the alternative, cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices. Furthermore, private label competitors are generally able to sell their products at lower prices because private label products typically have lower marketing costs than their branded counterparts. If our products fail to compete successfully with other branded or private label offerings in the industry, demand for our products and our sales volumes could be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, due to high levels of competition in our product categories, certain of our key retailers may demand price concessions on our products or may become more resistant to price increases for our products. Increased price competition and resistance to price increases have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our results of operations.\nErosion of the reputation of one or more of our leading brands could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\nThe majority of our net sales derive from sales of our branded products, including Silk, International Delight, LAND O LAKES, Horizon Organic, Earthbound Farm, So Delicious, Alpro, and Provamel, and growth in our business has resulted primarily from the strength of these products. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends on our ability to manage consumer perception and provide high-quality and innovative products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about WhiteWave, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, the reputation of our brands may suffer if any trademarks associated with our products are perceived negatively by consumers. For example, certain of our products are marketed under trademarks we have licensed from third parties, such as LAND O LAKES, Almond Joy, Cold Stone Creamery, Cinnabon, Dunkin Donuts, Hershey\u2019s, and YORK, and we are unable to control the quality of other products that third parties produce and market under those trademarks and trade names. Our results of operations could be negatively affected if the reputation of one or more of our brands suffers damage due to real or perceived quality issues with our products, or if we are found to have violated any applicable laws or regulations.\nOur financial success depends on our ability to successfully predict changes in consumer preferences and demand and develop successful new products in response.\nConsumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually. There are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the industry as a whole, including:\n\u2022\ndietary trends and increased attention to nutritional values, such as the sugar, fat, protein, fiber or calorie content of different foods and beverages;\n\u2022\nconcerns regarding the health effects of specific ingredients and nutrients, such as sugar, other sweeteners, gluten, dairy, soybeans, nuts, oils, vitamins, fiber and minerals; and\n\u2022\nincreasing awareness of the environmental and social effects of product production.\nOur success depends on our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to develop and offer products that appeal to consumer preferences. The development and introduction of new products could require substantial R&D and other expenditures, including capital investment and marketing and slotting costs. While we devote significant focus to R&D and to the development and launch of new products, we may not be successful in developing new products, or our new products may not be commercially successful or gain widespread market acceptance. Our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and rapidly identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets.\nWe are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims, which could harm our reputation, force us to recall products and incur substantial costs.\nThe sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury, illness or death to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized parties; misbranding; cross contamination of ingredients that are allergens; or product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. We also may be subject to liability if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, including environmental, health, and safety requirements, or in the event our products cause injury, illness, or death. For example, our organic salads, fruits and vegetables are subject to quality control processes, but it is not possible to ensure that the products are free from pathogenic organisms because the products are not pasteurized. In the fall of 2006, a third party recalled certain packaged fresh spinach sold to Earthbound Farm and others due to contamination by E. coli O157:H7. Although Earthbound Farm maintained insurance to cover recall losses, the insurance did not cover all losses incurred by this event and the company had a significant insurance deductible before receiving insurance proceeds and exposure for losses in excess of insurance coverage limits. In addition, in the past 12 months, WhiteWave has issued two voluntarily recalls for isolated production runs of Silk Light Original Soymilk and Horizon Cheddar Sandwich Crackers because those products may have been placed in incorrect packaging and, as a result, may contain undeclared almond or peanut ingredients, respectively, which could create allergic reactions for consumers who have an allergy or sensitivity to those nuts.\nIn addition, our product advertising could make us the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under U.S. federal and state laws, including the consumer protection statutes of some states, or laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, we were previously named in putative class action mislabeling complaints generally alleging that we lacked scientific substantiation for certain product claims related to our Horizon Organic products supplemented with DHA Omega-3. A significant product liability, consumer fraud, or other legal judgment against us or a widespread product recall would negatively impact our profitability. In addition, we have agreed with certain customers to provide defense and indemnification for certain types of these claims. Claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud, or other claim is found to be without merit or is otherwise unsuccessful, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation and brand image, particularly in categories that are promoted as having strong health and wellness credentials. Any loss of consumer confidence in our product ingredients or in the safety and quality of our products would be difficult and costly to overcome.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d).\nWe rely on IT networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, including order management, manufacturing, and logistics, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We also depend on our IT infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers and suppliers around the world. These IT systems, some of which are hosted and/or supported by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. If any of our significant IT systems suffer severe or prolonged damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results.\nLoss of our key management or other personnel, or an inability to attract such management and other personnel, could negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced senior management team. We also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. If we lose one or more members of our senior management team, or if we fail to attract talented new employees, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe may not be able to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions or establish and operate joint ventures.\nWe have grown and intend to continue to grow our business in part through the acquisition of new brands and the establishment of joint ventures in the United States, in Europe, and globally. We cannot be certain that we will successfully be able to:\n\u2022\nidentify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture partners and accurately assess their value, growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities, and potential profitability;\n\u2022\nsecure regulatory clearance for our acquisitions and joint ventures;\n\u2022\nnegotiate acquisitions and joint ventures on terms acceptable to us; and/or\n\u2022\nintegrate any acquisitions that we complete.\nAcquired companies or established joint ventures may not achieve the level of sales or profitability that justify our investment in them, or an acquired company may have unidentified liabilities for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible. These transactions typically involve a number of risks and present financial and other challenges, including the existence of unknown disputes, liabilities, or contingencies and changes in the industry, location, or regulatory or political environment in which these investments are located, that may arise after entering into such arrangements. Our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, integrating personnel and financial and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Future acquisitions or joint ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of any acquisitions we complete will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired companies or brands into our existing operations. For example, in 2014 we acquired the Earthbound Farm and So Delicious businesses and are working to effectively integrate these new businesses into our portfolio of brands and promote consistent standards of operations. We may experience difficulty entering new categories or geographies, integrating new products into our product mix, integrating an acquired company\u2019s or brand\u2019s distribution channels and sales force, achieving anticipated cost savings, retaining key personnel and customers of the acquired business, or integrating systems and administrative functions.\nOur international operations subject us to business risks that could cause our revenue and profitability to decline.\nBased upon current distribution, we estimate that our products are sold in over 50 countries worldwide. Sales to customers outside of North America accounted for 15%, 17% and 16% of our total net sales in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, in 2014 we formed a joint venture in China that began producing and selling products in China at the end of the year. Risks associated with our operations outside of the United States include:\n\u2022\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions that differ from those in the United States and change from time to time, such as tax, labor, and trade laws, food safety laws, antitrust and competition laws, and data privacy laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with complying with U.S. laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, applicable to entities with overseas operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing, and additional financial investments required to manage, operations outside the U.S. and ensuring consistent compliance with company policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exposures;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nincreased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation; and\n\u2022\ndiminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nIf one or more of these business risks occur, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur operations face foreign currency exchange exposure that could materially negatively impact our operating results.\nWe hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Chinese Renminbi (\"RMB\"). Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars at the then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus these non-U.S. currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. We may attempt to mitigate some of this risk with hedging and other activities; however our business nevertheless will remain subject to substantial foreign exchange risk from foreign currency translation exposure.\nThe loss of any of our largest customers or the continued consolidation in the retail industry could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\nOur largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and its subsidiaries, including Sam\u2019s Club, accounted for 14.6% of our total net sales in 2014 and our top 10 customers, collectively, accounted for 44% of our total net sales in 2014. We do not generally enter into written agreements with our customers, and where such agreements exist, they are generally terminable at will by the customer. The loss of any large customer, a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a large customer for an extended period could negatively affect our sales and results of operations.\nIn addition, as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger, our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through lower pricing and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to leverage the strength of our brands, and our marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected. In addition, our customers sometimes award contracts based on competitive bidding, which could result in lower profits for contracts we win and the loss of business for contracts we lose.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters, crop disease, pests and other natural conditions can impose significant costs and losses on our business.\nAgricultural products are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including severe rains, drought and temperature extremes, floods and windstorms, which are quite common but difficult to predict. For example, much of the state of California is experiencing extreme drought, which could impact the availability and cost of our raw materials, including almonds. Agricultural products also are vulnerable to crop disease and to pests, which may vary in severity and effect, depending on the stage of production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied and climatic conditions. Unfavorable growing conditions caused by these factors can reduce both crop size and crop quality and, in extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost. These factors may result in lower sales volume and, in the case of farms we manage, increased costs due to expenditures for additional farming techniques, the repair of infrastructure and the replanting of damaged or destroyed crops. Incremental costs, including transportation, may also be incurred if we need to find alternate short-term supplies of organic greens or other produce from other growers. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain sufficient internal production capacity or to enter into co-packing agreements on terms that are beneficial for us may result in our inability to meet customer demand and/or increase our operating costs and capital expenditures.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on maintaining a strong production platform and we rely on internal production resources and third-party co-packers to fulfill our manufacturing needs. Certain of our manufacturing plants are operating at high rates of utilization, and we may need to expand our production facilities or increase our reliance on third parties to provide manufacturing and supply services, commonly referred to as \u201cco-packing\u201d agreements, for a number of our products. A failure by us or our co-packers to comply with food safety, environmental, or other laws and regulations may disrupt our supply of products. In addition, we have experienced, and may experience, increased distribution and warehousing costs due to capacity constraints resulting from our growth. If we need to enter into additional co-packing, warehousing or distribution agreements in the future, we can provide no assurance that we would be able to find acceptable third party providers or enter into agreements on satisfactory terms or at all. In addition, we may need to expand our internal capacity, which could increase our operating costs and could require significant capital expenditures. If we cannot maintain sufficient production, warehousing and distribution capacity, either internally or through third party agreements, we may be unable to meet customer demand and/or our manufacturing, distribution and warehousing costs may increase, which could negatively affect our business.\nDisruption of our supply or distribution chains could adversely affect our business.\nDamage or disruption to our farming, manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, environmental incident, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers, distributors, warehousing, and transportation providers, or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. For example, the loss of any of Europe Foods & Beverages\u2019s third-party distributors for local representation in Europe could negatively affect our business. In addition, all of our organic salads, fruits and vegetables are processed in a single facility, and damage or disruption to this facility could impair our ability to process and sell those products. If we are unable to respond rapidly and effectively to any of these extraordinary events, or it is not financially feasible to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chain.\nReduced availability of raw materials and other inputs, as well as increased costs for our raw materials and other inputs, could adversely affect us.\nOur business depends heavily on raw materials and other inputs, such as conventional and organic raw milk, butterfat, almonds, organic and non-genetically modified (\u201cnon-GMO\u201d) soybeans, sweeteners, and organic salad greens and produce, used in the production of our products and commodities, such as packaging, utilities, natural gas, resin and petroleum-based products, used in the packaging and distribution of our products. Our raw materials are generally sourced from third-party suppliers, and we are not assured of continued supply, pricing, or exclusive access to raw materials from any of these suppliers. In addition, a substantial portion of our raw materials are agricultural products, which are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as severe rains, floods, droughts, frost, earthquakes, and pestilence. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters also can lower dairy and crop yields and reduce supplies of these ingredients or increase their prices. Other events that adversely affect our third-party suppliers and that are out of our control, such as problems with our suppliers\u2019 businesses, finances, labor relations, costs, production, insurance, and reputation, could also impair our ability to obtain the raw materials and other inputs that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we desire. Over the past several years, we have experienced increased costs as a result of weather conditions and other events outside our and our suppliers\u2019 control and this may continue given recent weather conditions. In addition, we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of certain raw materials; however, our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date we actually take receipt of the commodity, resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings.\nThe organic ingredients (including milk, organic salads, fruits and vegetables, other dairy-related products, and soybeans) and non-GMO ingredients for our products are less plentiful and available from fewer suppliers than their conventional counterparts. Competition with other manufacturers in the procurement of organic and non-GMO product ingredients may increase in the future if consumer demand for organic and non-GMO products increases. In addition, the dairy industry continues to experience periodic imbalances between supply and demand for organic raw milk. Industry regulation and the costs of organic farming compared to costs of conventional farming have impacted, and may continue to impact, the supply of organic raw milk in the market. Oversupply levels of organic raw milk can increase competitive pressure on our products and pricing, while supply shortages can cause product shortages and higher costs to us. Cost increases in raw materials and other inputs could cause our profits to decrease significantly compared to prior periods, as we may be unable to increase our prices to offset the increased cost of these raw materials and other inputs. If we are unable to obtain raw materials and other inputs for our products or offset any increased costs for such raw materials and inputs, our business could be negatively affected.\nEconomic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products and negatively affect our sales and profitability\nRetailers are increasingly offering private label products that compete with our products. Consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to consumers at the right price. It is also important that our products are perceived to be of a higher quality than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in quality between our products and those of private label brands narrows, or if such difference in quality is perceived to have narrowed, then consumers may not buy our products. Furthermore, during periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may shift their purchases to lower-priced or private label products or forego certain purchases altogether. They also may reduce the number of organic and premium products that they purchase because organic and premium products generally have higher retail prices than their conventional counterparts. Lower consumer demand resulting from an economic downturn could decrease our sales volumes and negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe may need additional financing in the future, and we may not be able to obtain that financing.\nFrom time to time, we may need additional financing to support our business and pursue our growth strategy, including strategic acquisitions. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if and when required, will depend on investor demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets, and other factors. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all.\nChanges in our credit ratings may have a negative impact on our future financing costs or the availability of capital.\nSome of our indebtedness is rated by Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and there are a number of factors beyond our control that could impact these ratings. Our credit ratings are currently considered to be below \u201cinvestment grade.\u201d Although the interest rates on our existing indebtedness are not affected by declines in our credit ratings, such ratings or any rating downgrades may impair our ability to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, may cause the value of our securities to decline and may have other negative implications with respect to our business.\nOur substantial debt and financial obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our business, and we may incur additional debt.\nAs of January 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings of approximately $1.0 billion and we had $5.9 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facilities. We also had additional borrowing capacity of approximately $978.4 million under our senior secured credit facilities, and our senior secured credit facilities allow us, as borrower, to add one or more incremental term loan facilities and/or increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our debt levels and the terms of our financing arrangements:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our debt, which will reduce the funds we have available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nmay limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, especially if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward;\n\u2022\nmay limit our future ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\nmay subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage for us and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition;\n\u2022\nmay limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions or in funding our strategic growth plan; and\n\u2022\nimpose on us financial and operational restrictions.\nIf we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions, including reducing spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, advertising and product innovation, reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness.\nThe credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities contains various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nborrow money or guarantee debt\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake specified types of investments and acquisitions\n\u2022\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsell assets or merge with other companies\nThese restrictions on the operation of our business could harm us by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition opportunities, and other corporate opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants.\nLabor issues could adversely affect our business.\nAs of January 2015, approximately 27% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council representation. Our collective bargaining agreements are scheduled to expire at various times over the next five years. A strike, work slowdown, or other labor unrest could in some cases impair our ability to supply our products to customers, which could\nresult in reduced revenue and customer claims, and may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities.\nWe purchase a portion of our organic greens and other fresh produce from third-party growers who grow these products in the United States. The personnel engaged for harvesting operations by these third-party growers and by us, typically include significant numbers of immigrants who are authorized to work in the United States. The availability and number of these workers may decrease if certain changes are enacted in U.S. immigration laws. A scarcity of available personnel to harvest agricultural products in the United States could increase our costs for those products or could lead to product shortages.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, and licenses, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party confidentiality, nondisclosure, and assignment agreements, and by policing third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.\nWe also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, a successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nA failure to renew or a termination of our licenses for the use of other parties\u2019 intellectual property could result in the loss of significant sales.\nWe have entered into license agreements to use certain trademarks, service marks, and trade names, such as LAND O LAKES, Almond Joy, Cold Stone Creamery, Cinnabon, Dunkin Donuts, Hershey\u2019s, and YORK, to brand and market some of our products. In addition, we have entered into a license agreement with DSM Nutritional Products, the owner of Martek Biosciences Corporation, to use products covered by a patent for supplementing certain of our premium dairy and soy products with DHA Omega-3. Most of these agreements are scheduled to expire at various dates in the future, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these licenses on acceptable terms upon expiration or at all or that we will be able to acquire new licenses to use other popular trademarks or proprietary products or processes. The termination or expiration of a license agreement would cause us to lose the sales and any associated profits generated pursuant to such license and in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related intangible assets.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation.\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates.\nOur business is subject to various environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, which may increase our compliance costs or subject us to liabilities.\nOur business operations are subject to numerous requirements in the United States, the European Union, and China relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and the National Organic Standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as similar state and local statutes and regulations in the United States, in each of the countries in which we do business in Europe, and China. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions and the discharge of wastewater and other pollutants, the use of refrigerants, the handling and disposal of hazardous materials, and the cleanup of contamination in the environment. We could incur significant costs, including fines, penalties and other sanctions, cleanup costs, and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of the\nfailure to comply with, or liabilities under, environmental, health, and safety requirements. New legislation, as well as current federal and other state regulatory initiatives relating to these environmental matters, could require us to replace equipment, install additional pollution controls, purchase various emission allowances, or curtail operations. These costs could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nViolations of laws or regulations related to the food industry, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations related to the food industry, could adversely affect our business.\nThe food production and marketing industry is subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including food safety requirements related to the ingredients, manufacture, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling, and distribution of our products, as well as those related to worker health and workplace safety. Our activities, both in and outside of the United States, are subject to extensive regulation. We are regulated by, among other federal and state authorities, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor, as well as by similar authorities abroad within the regulatory framework of the European Union and its members and by similar authorities in China. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, healthcare costs, energy usage, immigration, and other labor issues, all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or those of our customers or suppliers. In addition, the marketing and advertising of our products could make us the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, and we may be subject to initiatives that limit or prohibit the marketing and advertising of our products to children. We are also subject to federal laws and regulations relating to our organic products and production. For example, as required by the National Organic Program (\u201cNOP\u201d), we rely on third parties to certify certain of our products and production locations as organic. Because the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990, which created the NOP, was so recently adopted, many regulations and informal positions taken by the NOP are subject to continued review and scrutiny. Changes in these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase our compliance costs, increase other costs of doing business for us, our customers, or our suppliers, or restrict our actions, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In some cases, increased regulatory scrutiny could interrupt distribution of our products, as could be the case in the United States as the FDA enacts the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, or force changes in our production processes and our products. Further, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIncreases in costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.\nWith approximately 4,500 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of current and post-retirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. These costs can vary substantially as a result of changes in health care laws and costs. These factors may put pressure on the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases. If we do not succeed, our profitability could be negatively affected.\nWe have only been a stand-alone public company since October 2012, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone public company prior to October 2012 and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nWe derived the historical financial information included in this report for periods prior to January 1, 2013 from Dean Foods\u2019 consolidated financial statements. This information does not necessarily reflect the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows we would have achieved as a stand-alone public company during that period, primarily due to the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to our initial public offering in October 2012, we operated as a segment of Dean Foods, rather than as a stand-alone company. Dean Foods historically performed various corporate services for us, including executive management, supply chain, information technology, legal, finance and accounting, investor relations, human resources, risk management, tax, treasury, and other services. Our pre-2013 financial information reflects allocations of corporate expenses from Dean Foods for these and similar functions. These allocations may not reflect the costs we would have incurred for similar services had we been a stand-alone public company during that period.\n\u2022\nWe entered into agreements that formalized and, in certain cases, modified our ongoing commercial arrangements with certain current and former wholly-owned subsidiaries of Dean Foods. Under these agreements, the current and former Dean Foods subsidiaries agreed to continue to manufacture and/or sell and distribute our products on our behalf, supply us with certain raw materials and other inputs, and provide certain other services. These agreements were negotiated among representatives of Dean Foods\u2019 business platforms and, we believe, reflect substantially the terms that we would have been able to obtain from third parties, taking into account the nature of certain ongoing customer relationships. When these agreements expire or terminate, we may not be able to negotiate renewals or new agreements with third parties on terms that are favorable to us.\n\u2022\nOur pre-2013 historical financial information has not been adjusted and does not reflect changes that we have experienced as a result of becoming a stand-alone public company. These changes include (1) changes in our cost structure, personnel needs, tax structure, and business operations, (2) changes in our management, (3) potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale, and (4) increased costs associated with corporate governance, investor and public relations, and public company reporting and compliance.\nTherefore, our historical financial information may not necessarily be indicative of our future financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, and the occurrence of any of the risks discussed in this \u201cRisk factors\u201d section, or any other event, could cause our future financial position, results of operations, or cash flows to materially differ from our historical financial information.\nOur agreements with Dean Foods and the desire to preserve the tax-free status of our spin-off from Dean Foods may limit our ability to take certain corporate actions following the Distribution, and we could owe significant tax indemnification payments to Dean Foods if the Distribution or other steps in the spin-off is taxable as a result of actions by us or acquisitions of our stock or assets.\nOne component of our growth strategy involves acquiring other businesses. However, in order to preserve the tax-free status of our spin-off from Dean Foods, we are subject to certain restrictions on actions related to our common stock, including the issuance, sale, redemption or repurchase of our common stock. These restrictions could substantially limit our strategic and operational flexibility. In addition, we generally have agreed to indemnify Dean Foods and its affiliates against any and all taxes incurred by them relating to the spin-off failing to be tax-free to the extent such taxes are caused by our actions or acquisitions of our stock or assets by any person other than Dean Foods or its affiliates. If we were to become liable under such indemnity, it would result in a significant liability to us as such taxes would likely be substantial.\nImposition of new taxes or disagreements with tax or other governmental authorities could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations of various federal, state and local governments in the United States, as well as tax laws and regulations outside the United States. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense. In the ordinary course of our business, we may engage in transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nWe are subject to reviews, examinations and investigations by tax and other governmental authorities both within and outside the United States. Economic and political pressures in various jurisdictions to increase tax revenues may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The final determination of tax audits, investigations or any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax expense and accruals and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the periods for which that determination is made.", "PERMNO": 13916, "SIC": 2020, "TIC": "WWAV"}
