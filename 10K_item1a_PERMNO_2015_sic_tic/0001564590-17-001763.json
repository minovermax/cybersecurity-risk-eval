RISK FACTORS\nThe company\u2019s operations could be affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. Based on current information, we believe that the following identifies the most significant risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. See \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for more details.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nConditions in the global economy and global capital markets may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur business and operating results may in the future be adversely affected by global economic conditions, including instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges such as the changing financial regulatory environment that could affect the global economy. Our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers could experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to supply materials or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us. Because we have significant international operations, there are a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings. Also, our effective tax rate may fluctuate because of variability in geographic mix of earnings, changes in statutory rates, and taxes associated with repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. Future weakness in the global economy and failure to manage these risks could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.\nThe Chemours Company\nMarket conditions, as well as global and regional economic downturns that adversely affect the demand for the end-use products that contain TiO2, fluoroproducts or our other products, could adversely affect the profitability of our operations and the prices at which we can sell our products, negatively impacting our financial results.\nOur revenue and profitability is largely dependent on the TiO2 industry and the industries that are end users of our fluoroproducts. TiO2 and our fluoroproducts, such as refrigerants and resins, are used in many \u201cquality of life\u201d products for which demand historically has been linked to global, regional and local GDP and discretionary spending, which can be negatively impacted by regional and world events or economic conditions. Such events are likely to cause a decrease in demand for our products and, as a result, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The future profitability of our operations, and cash flows generated by those operations, will also be affected by the available supply of our products in the market.\nOur reported results could be adversely affected by currency exchange rates and currency devaluation could impair our competitiveness.\nDue to our international operations, we transact in many foreign currencies, including but not limited to the Euro, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Japanese yen. As a result, we are subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. During periods of local economic crisis, local currencies may be devalued significantly against the U.S. dollar, potentially reducing our margin. For example, unfavorable movement in the Euro has negatively impacted our results of operations since the second half of 2014, and further decline of the Euro could affect future periods. Currently, Chemours does not hedge on a transactional basis. There can be no assurance that any hedging action in the future will lessen the adverse impact of a variation in currency rates. Also, actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability. For example, in Titanium Technologies, a substantial portion of our manufacturing is located in the U.S. and Mexico, while our TiO2 is delivered to customers around the world. Furthermore, our ore cost is principally denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, in periods when the U.S. dollar or Mexican Peso strengthen against other local currencies such as the Euro, our costs are higher relative to our competitors who operate largely outside of the United States, and the benefits we realize from having lower costs associated with our manufacturing process are reduced, impacting our profitability.\nIf we are unable to execute our cost reduction plans successfully, our total operating costs may be greater than expected, which may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe have announced a transformation plan that includes a number of cost saving measures. We have implemented a number of these measures and have realized a portion of the anticipated benefits. While we continue to search for opportunities to reduce our costs and expenses to improve operating profitability without jeopardizing the quality of our products or the effectiveness of our operations, our success in achieving targeted cost and expense reductions depends upon a number of factors such as timing of execution, market condition, and regulatory and local requirements and approvals. If we do not successfully execute on our cost reduction initiatives or if we experience delays in completing the implementation of these initiatives, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies.\nWe face risks arising from various unasserted and asserted legal claims, investigation and litigation matters, such as product liability, patent infringement, antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental actions (which may concern regulated or unregulated substances) or other torts, including, as discussed below, litigation related to the production and use of PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acids and its salts, including the ammonium salt) by DuPont prior to the separation. We have noted a nationwide trend in purported class actions against chemical manufacturers generally seeking relief such as medical monitoring, property damages, off-site remediation and punitive damages arising from alleged environmental actions (which may concern regulated or unregulated substances) or other torts without claiming present personal injuries. We also have noted a trend in public and private nuisance suits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public. Various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such as a final adverse judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on us. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results and could adversely impact the value of any of our brands that are associated with any such matters. As discussed in more detail in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, DuPont is the named defendant in approximately 3,500 lawsuits alleging that the respective plaintiffs were exposed to PFOA in drinking water as a result of DuPont\u2019s use of PFOA at the Washington Works plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia. These personal injury lawsuits were consolidated in multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (the \u201cMDL\u201d). As of December 31, 2016, three cases have gone to trial and resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and several other cases have been settled. Although we,\nThe Chemours Company\nthrough DuPont, are pursuing appeals of the cases that resulted in a jury verdict, there can be no assurance that any such appeal succeeds. On February 11, 2017, DuPont entered into an agreement in principle with plaintiffs\u2019 counsel representing the MDL plaintiffs providing for a global settlement of all cases and claims in the MDL, including all filed and unfiled personal injury cases and claims that are part of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s claim inventory, as well as cases that have been tried to a jury verdict (the \u201cMDL Settlement\u201d). The total settlement amount is $670.7 million dollars in cash, half of which will be paid by Chemours and half paid by DuPont. DuPont\u2019s payment would not be subject to indemnification or reimbursement by Chemours, and Chemours has accrued $335 million associated with this matter at December 31, 2016. In exchange for payment of the total settlement amount, DuPont and Chemours will receive a complete release of all claims by the settling plaintiffs. The MDL Settlement was entered into solely by way of compromise and settlement and is not in any way an admission of liability or fault by DuPont or Chemours. The MDL Settlement is not subject to court approval; however, the MDL Settlement may not proceed in certain conditions, including a walk-away right that enables DuPont to terminate the MDL Settlement if more than a specified number of plaintiffs determine not to participate. If the MDL Settlement does not proceed, any cases stayed or additional lawsuits may go to trial or appeal. An adverse ruling at trial or on appeal could result in us incurring additional costs and liabilities. There could also be new lawsuits filed related to DuPont\u2019s use of PFOA, its manufacture of PFOA, or its customers use of DuPont products that may not be within the scope of the MDL Settlement. Any such new litigation could also result in us incurring additional costs and liabilities, which may be material to our financial results. If such litigation described above were to occur and if significant unfavorable outcomes in a number of cases were to result, losses, if incurred, in excess of amounts accrued at December 31, 2016 could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses, and issue guarantees of third party obligations. Additionally, we are required to indemnify DuPont with regard to liabilities allocated to, or assumed by us under each of the separation agreement, the employee matters agreement, the tax matters agreement and the intellectual property cross-license agreement that were executed prior to the spin-off. These indemnification obligations to date have included defense costs associated with certain litigation matters as well as certain damages awards, settlements, and penalties. In connection with MDL Settlement mentioned above, DuPont and Chemours agreed, subject to and following the completion of the MDL Settlement, to a limited sharing of potential future PFOA liabilities (i.e., \u201cindemnifiable losses,\u201d as defined in the separation agreement between DuPont and Chemours) for a period of five years. During that five-year period, Chemours would annually pay future PFOA liabilities up to $25 million and, if such amount is exceeded, DuPont would pay any excess amount up to the next $25 million (which payment will not be subject to indemnification by Chemours), with Chemours annually bearing any further excess liabilities under the terms of the separation agreement. After the five-year period, this limited sharing agreement would expire, and Chemours\u2019 indemnification obligations under the separation agreement would continue unchanged. Chemours has also agreed that, upon the MDL Settlement becoming effective, it will not contest its liability to DuPont under the separation agreement for PFOA liabilities on the basis of ostensible defenses generally applicable to the indemnification provisions under the separation agreement, including defenses relating to punitive damages, fines or penalties or attorneys\u2019 fees, and waives any such defenses with respect to PFOA liabilities. Chemours has, however, retained defenses as to whether any particular PFOA claim is within the scope of the indemnification provisions of the separation agreement. As we are required to make payments, such payments could be significant and could exceed the amounts we have accrued with respect thereto, adversely affecting our results of operations. In addition, in the event that DuPont seeks indemnification for adverse trial rulings or outcomes, these indemnification claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition. Disputes between Chemours and DuPont many also arise with respect to indemnification matters including disputes based on matters of law or contract interpretation. If and to the extent these disputes arise, they could materially adversely affect us.\nFor further information about the Company\u2019s litigation and other commitments and contingencies, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and our Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may result in unanticipated loss or liability related to our current and past operations, which could reduce our profitability.\nOur operations and production facilities are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations at national, international and local levels in numerous jurisdictions relating to pollution, protection of the environment, climate change, transporting and storing raw materials and finished products and storing and disposing of hazardous wastes. Such laws include, in the U.S., the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, often referred to as Superfund), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and similar state and global laws for management and remediation of hazardous materials, the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the Clean Water Act, for protection of air and water resources, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and in the EU, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), for regulation of chemicals in commerce and reporting of potential known adverse effects and numerous local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations governing materials transport and packaging. If we are found to be in violation of these laws or regulations, which may be subject to change based on legislative, scientific or other factors, we may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions, remediation costs, reputational harm, loss of sales or market access, or experience interruptions in our operations. We\nThe Chemours Company\nalso may be subject to changes in our operations and production based on increased regulation or other changes to, or restrictions imposed by, any such additional regulations. In addition, the manner in which adopted regulations (including environmental regulations) are ultimately implemented may affect our products, the demand for and public perception of our products, the reputation of our brands, our market access and our results of operations. In the event of a catastrophic incident involving any of the raw materials we use or chemicals we produce, we could incur material costs as a result of addressing the consequences of such event and future reputational costs associated with any such event.\nAs a result of our operations, including the operations of divested businesses and certain discontinued operations, we could incur substantial costs, including remediation and restoration costs. The costs of complying with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. This includes costs we expect to continue to incur for environmental investigation and remediation activities at a number of our current or former sites and third-party disposal locations. However, the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to accurately predict. While we establish accruals in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the ultimate actual costs and liabilities may vary from the accruals because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors (many of which are outside of our control), including the nature of the matter and any associated third-party claims, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of other PRPs. See \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d within Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThere is also a risk that one or more of our key raw materials or one or more of our products may be found to have, or be characterized as having, a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment or on our customers or employees or unregulated emissions, which could potentially result in us incurring liability in connection with such characterization and the associated effects of any toxicological or health-related impact. If such a discovery or characterization occurs, we may incur increased costs in order to comply with new regulatory requirements or the relevant materials or products, including products of our customers incorporating our materials or products, may be recalled or banned. Changes in laws, science or regulations, or their interpretation, and our customers\u2019 perception of such changes or interpretations may also affect the marketability of certain of our products.\nThe markets for many of our products have seasonally affected sales patterns.\nThe demand for TiO2, certain of our fluoroproducts and certain of our other products during a given year is subject to seasonal fluctuations. As a result of seasonal fluctuations, our operating cash flow may be negatively impacted due to demand fluctuations. In particular, because TiO2 is widely used in coatings, demand is higher in the painting seasons of spring and summer. Because certain fluoroproducts are used in refrigerants, such products are in higher demand in the spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere. We may be adversely affected by anticipated or unanticipated changes in regional weather conditions. For example, poor weather conditions in a region can lead to an abbreviated painting season, which can depress consumer sales of paint products that use TiO2, which could have a negative effect on our cash position.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our ability to meet our reporting requirements.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. One key aspect of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is that we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, with auditor attestation of the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our common shares could decline and we could be subject to penalties or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports, and to effectively prevent fraud. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our operating results could be harmed. In addition, if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience delay in the implementation of new or enhanced system, procedures and controls, or if we\nThe Chemours Company\nexperience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nEffects of price fluctuations in energy and raw materials, our raw materials contracts and our inability to renew such contracts, could have a significant impact on our earnings.\nOur manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Variations in the cost of energy, which primarily reflect market prices for oil and natural gas, and for raw materials may significantly affect our operating results from period to period. Additionally, consolidation in the industries providing our raw materials may have an impact on the cost and availability of such materials. To the extent we do not have fixed price contracts with respect to specific raw materials, we have no control over the costs of raw materials and such costs may fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in availability, major capacity additions or reductions, or significant facility operating problems.\nWhen possible, we have purchased, and we plan to continue to purchase, raw materials, including titanium bearing ores and fluorspar, through negotiated medium- or long-term contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. To the extent that we have been able to achieve favorable pricing in our existing negotiated long-term contracts, we may not be able to renew such contracts at the current prices, or at all, and this may adversely impact our cash flow from operations. However, to the extent that the prices of raw materials that we utilize significantly decline, we may be bound by the terms of our existing long-term contracts and obligated to purchase such raw materials at higher prices as compared to other market participants.\nWe attempt to offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through selling price increases, productivity improvements, and cost reduction programs. However, the outcome of these efforts is largely determined by existing competitive and economic conditions, and may be subject to a time delay between the increase in our raw materials costs and our ability to increase prices, which could vary significantly depending on the market served. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy or raw material costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nHazards associated with chemical manufacturing, storage and transportation could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThere are hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. These hazards could lead to an interruption or suspension of operations and have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or on us as a whole. While we endeavor to provide adequate protection for the safe handling of these materials, issues could be created by various events, including natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of sabotage and performance by third parties, and as a result we could face the following potential hazards:\n\u2022\npiping and storage tank leaks and ruptures;\n\u2022\nmechanical failure;\n\u2022\nemployee exposure to hazardous substances; and\n\u2022\nchemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases.\nThese hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which could lead to government fines and penalties, work stoppage injunctions, claims and lawsuits by injured persons, damage to our public reputation and brands, loss of sales and market access, customer dissatisfaction, and diminished product acceptance. If such actions are determined adversely to us or there is an associated economic impact to our business, we may have inadequate insurance or cash flow to offset any associated costs. Such outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe businesses in which we compete are highly competitive. This competition may adversely affect our results of operations and operating cash flows.\nEach of the businesses in which we operate is highly competitive. Competition in the performance chemicals industry is based on a number of factors such as price, product quality and service. We face significant competition from major international and regional competitors. Additionally, our Titanium Technologies business competes with numerous regional producers, including producers in China, which have expanded their readily available production capacity during the previous five years. Additionally, the risk of substitution of Chinese producers by our customers could increase as they expand their use of chloride production technology. Some competitors have announced plans to expand their chloride capacity.\nThe Chemours Company\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be seriously impacted by business disruptions and security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.\nBusiness and/or supply chain disruptions, plant downtime and/or power outages and information technology system and/or network disruptions, regardless of cause including acts of sabotage, employee error or other actions, geo-political activity, weather events and natural disasters could seriously harm our operations as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers, viruses, breaches due to employee error or actions or other disruptions could result in misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential business information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, loss of sales and interference with regulatory compliance. Like most major corporations, we have been and expect to be the target of industrial espionage, including cyber-attacks, from time to time. We have determined that these attacks have resulted, and could result in the future, in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information, and have included the obtaining of trade secrets and proprietary information related to the chloride manufacturing process for TiO2 by third parties. Although we do not believe that we have experienced any material losses to date related to these breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer any such losses in the future. We plan to actively manage the risks within our control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, we may be required to expend significant resources to enhance our control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our intellectual property were compromised or copied by competitors, or if our competitors were to develop similar or superior intellectual property or technology, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nIntellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks and tradenames are important to our business. We endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions in which our products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which our products are imported. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights. However, we may be unable to obtain protection for our intellectual property in key jurisdictions. Although we own and have applied for numerous patents and trademarks throughout the world, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third party intellectual property rights.\nWe also rely materially upon unpatented proprietary technology, know-how and other trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. While we maintain policies to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our proprietary expertise and other trade secrets, these agreements may not be enforceable or, even if legally enforceable, we may not have adequate remedies for breaches of such agreements. We also may not be able to readily detect breaches of such agreements. The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology, know-how or trade secrets could result in significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins or loss of market share.\nIf we must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions under the intellectual property cross-license agreement could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products and/or prosecute, maintain and enforce certain intellectual property.\nWe depend to a certain extent on DuPont to prosecute, maintain and enforce certain of the intellectual property licensed under the intellectual property cross-license agreement. Specifically, DuPont is responsible for filing, prosecuting and maintaining patents that DuPont licenses to us. DuPont also has the first right to enforce such patents, trade secrets and the know-how licensed to us by DuPont. If DuPont fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents, trade secrets or know-how under the intellectual property cross-license agreement, we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competitive products (unless we are able to effectively exercise our secondary rights to enforce such patents, trade secrets and know-how).\nIn addition, our restrictions under the intellectual property cross-license agreement could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products. For example, the licenses granted to us under the agreement may not extend to all new products, services and businesses that we may enter in the future. These limitations and restrictions may make it more difficult, time consuming\nThe Chemours Company\nor expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products and services, or may result in certain of our products or services being later to market than those of our competitors.\nIf we are unable to innovate and successfully introduce new products, or new technologies or processes reduce the demand for our products or the price at which we can sell products, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur industries and the end-use markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and product improvement. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of commercial and technological progress in key end-use markets and on our ability to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products in such changing end-use markets. We must continue to identify, develop and market innovative products or enhance existing products on a timely basis to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position. We may be unable to develop new products or technology, either alone or with third parties, or license intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis. If we fail to keep pace with the evolving technological innovations in our end-use markets on a competitive basis, including with respect to innovation with regard to the development of alternative uses for, or application of, products developed that utilize such end-use products, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot predict whether technological innovations will, in the future, result in a lower demand for our products or affect the competitiveness of our business. We may be required to invest significant resources to adapt to changing technologies, markets, competitive environments and laws and regulations. We cannot anticipate market acceptance of new products or future products. In addition, we may not achieve our expected benefits associated with new products developed to meet new laws or regulations if the implementation of such laws or regulations is delayed.\nIn connection with our separation, we were required to assume, and indemnify DuPont for, certain liabilities. As we are required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities to DuPont, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, DuPont\u2019s obligation to indemnify us for certain liabilities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility, and DuPont may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the separation agreement, the employee matters agreement, the tax matters agreement and the intellectual property cross-license agreement we entered into with DuPont prior to the spin-off, we were required to assume, and indemnify DuPont for, certain liabilities. These indemnification obligations to date have included, among other items, defense costs associated with certain litigation matters as well as certain damages awards, settlement amounts and penalties. In connection with MDL Settlement described above under \u201cOur results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies\u201d, DuPont and Chemours agreed, subject to and following the completion of the MDL Settlement, to a limited sharing of potential future PFOA liabilities (i.e., \u201cindemnifiable losses,\u201d as defined in the separation agreement between DuPont and Chemours) for a period of five years. During that five-year period, Chemours would annually pay future PFOA liabilities up to $25 million and, if such amount is exceeded, DuPont would pay any excess amount up to the next $25 million (which payment will not be subject to indemnification by Chemours), with Chemours annually bearing any further excess liabilities under the terms of the separation agreement. After the five-year period, this limited sharing agreement would expire, and Chemours\u2019 indemnification obligations under the separation agreement would continue unchanged. Chemours has also agreed that, upon the MDL Settlement becoming effective, it will not contest its liability to DuPont under the separation agreement for PFOA liabilities on the basis of ostensible defenses generally applicable to the indemnification provisions under the separation agreement, including defenses relating to punitive damages, fines or penalties or attorneys\u2019 fees, and waives any such defenses with respect to PFOA liabilities. Chemours has, however, retained defenses as to whether any particular PFOA claim is within the scope of the indemnification provisions of the separation agreement. Payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distribution. In addition, in the event that DuPont seeks indemnification for adverse trial rulings or outcomes, these indemnification claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition. Disputes between Chemours and DuPont may also arise with respect to indemnification matters, including disputes based on matter of law or contract interpretation. If and to the extent these disputes arise, they could materially adversely affect us.\nThird parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities of the DuPont businesses. DuPont has agreed to indemnify us for such liabilities, but such indemnity from DuPont may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and DuPont may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from DuPont any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe Chemours Company\nIn connection with our separation, we were required to enter into numerous separation-related and commercial agreements with our former parent company, DuPont, which may not reflect optimal or commercially beneficial terms to Chemours.\nCommercial agreements we entered into with DuPont in connection with the separation were negotiated in the context of the separation while we were still a wholly-owned subsidiary of DuPont. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were negotiated, we did not have an independent board of directors or management independent of DuPont. Certain commercial agreements, having long terms and commercially advantageous cancellation and assignment rights to DuPont, may not include adjustments for changes in industry and market conditions. There is a risk that the pricing and other terms under these agreements may not be commercially beneficial and may not be able to be renegotiated in the future. The terms relate to, among other things, the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations, including the provision of products and services and the sharing and operation of property, manufacturing, office and laboratory sites, and other commercial rights and obligations between DuPont and us.\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate efficiently as an independent company.\nThere is a risk that, since separating from DuPont, we are more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been if we were still a part of DuPont\u2019s organizational structure. As part of DuPont, we were able to enjoy certain benefits from DuPont\u2019s operating diversity, purchasing power and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with DuPont\u2019s other businesses. As an independent, publicly traded company, we do not have similar diversity or integration opportunities and do not have similar purchasing power or access to capital markets. Additionally, as part of DuPont, we were able to leverage the DuPont historical market reputation and performance and brand identity to recruit and retain key personnel to run our business. As an independent, publicly traded company, we do not have the same historical market reputation and performance or brand identity as DuPont and it may be more difficult for us to recruit or retain such key personnel.\nOur ability to make future strategic decisions regarding our manufacturing operations are subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, and to certain extent may be subject to consents or cooperation from DuPont under the agreements entered into between us and DuPont as part of the separation. These could adversely affect our ability to execute our future strategic decisions and our results of operations and financial condition.\nOne of the ways we may improve our business is through the expansion or improvement of our existing facilities, such as the expansion of our Altamira TiO2 facility and the planned expansions for our OpteonTM refrigerant and our Mining Solutions facility. Construction of additions or modifications to facilities involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic uncertainties that are beyond our control. Such expansion or improvement projects may also require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, and financing may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all. As a result, these projects may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all. Moreover, our revenue may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. As a result, we may not be able to realize our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner. Based on our assessments, we may make strategic decisions regarding our manufacturing operations such as capital improvements to modernize certain units, move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility, discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility, some of which have significant shared services and lease agreements with DuPont. These agreements may adversely impact our ability to take these strategic decisions regarding out manufacturing operations. Further, if such agreements are terminated or revised, we would have to assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations, the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility that could result in future charges that could be significant.\nThe Chemours Company\nOur customers, prospective customers, suppliers or other companies with whom we conduct business may need assurances that our financial stability is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them.\nSome of our customers, prospective customers, suppliers or other companies with whom we conduct business may need assurances that our financial stability is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them, and may require us to provide additional credit support, such as letters of credit or other financial guarantees. Any failure of parties to be satisfied with our financial stability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are a holding company that is dependent on cash flows from our operating subsidiaries to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.\nAll of our operations are conducted and all of our assets are owned by our operating companies, which are our subsidiaries. We intend to continue to conduct our operations at the operating companies and any future subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations or make cash distributions depends upon the cash flow of our operating companies and any future subsidiaries, and the payment of funds by our operating companies and any future subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise. The ability of our operating companies and any future subsidiaries to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities, and legal restrictions regarding the transfer of funds.\nOur debt is generally the exclusive obligation of The Chemours Company and our guarantor subsidiaries. Because a significant portion of our operations are conducted by nonguarantor subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of such debt at maturity, are dependent to a large extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such nonguarantor subsidiaries. Any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our nonguarantor subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our nonguarantor subsidiaries. In addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings.\nOur subsidiaries are separate legal entities and, except for our guarantor subsidiaries, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any funds available for those amounts, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, our debt. Any right that we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary, and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary.\nIf our long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Under U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, changes in the industries in which we operate, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy, as well as competition or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability. We may be required to record a significant noncash charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the anti-corruption laws of the United States and various international jurisdictions could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations.\nDoing business on a global basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and those of various international and sub-national jurisdictions, and our failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d) as well as anti-corruption laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The FCPA, the Bribery Act and other laws prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and agents acting on our behalf from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. Our global operations may expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, the foregoing or other anti-corruption laws. Such violations could be punishable by criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and exclusion from government contracts, as well as other\nThe Chemours Company\nremedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be very expensive, disruptive, and damaging to our reputation. Although we have implemented anti-corruption policies and procedures since the separation, there can be no guarantee that these policies, procedures, and training will effectively prevent violations by our employees or representatives in the future. Additionally, we face a risk that our distributors and other business partners may violate the FCPA, the Bribery Act or similar laws or regulations. Such violations could expose us to FCPA and Bribery Act liability and/or our reputation may potentially be harmed by their violations and resulting sanctions and fines.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur significant indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, and we could have difficulty fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness, which may have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $3.6 billion of indebtedness. At December 31, 2016, together with the guarantors, we had approximately $1.4 billion of senior secured indebtedness outstanding, and had an additional $750 million of capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, all of which would be senior secured indebtedness if drawn. Our significant level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. The level of our indebtedness could have other important consequences on our business, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from capitalizing on business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into certain commercial arrangements because of concerns of counterparty risks; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us.\nDespite our significant level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nNotwithstanding our significant level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including additional secured indebtedness that would be effectively senior to the notes (including up to $750 million of available capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility). Although the indenture that governs the notes and the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to enter into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions, including secured indebtedness, could be substantial. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. To the extent such new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor would increase.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms.\nOur industry is capital intensive, and we may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing research and development activities and meet general working capital needs. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including acceptance of and demand for our products, the extent to which we invest in new technology and research and development projects, and the status and timing of these developments, as well as general availability of capital from debt and/or equity markets.\nHowever, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable, if at all. Also, regardless of the terms of our debt or equity financing, our agreements and obligations under the tax matters agreement may limit our ability to issue stock. For a\nThe Chemours Company\nmore detailed discussion, see risk factor \u201cWe agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the tax-free treatment of the transactions in the U.S., which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\u201d If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our failure to maintain the credit ratings on our debt securities, including the notes, could negatively affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense on future indebtedness. We expect the credit rating agencies to periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of the credit ratings on our debt securities. Any negative rating agency actions could constrain the capital available to us, reduce or eliminate available borrowing to us and could limit our access to and/or increase the cost of funding our operations. If, as a result, our ability to access capital when needed becomes constrained, our interest costs could increase, which could have material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. As a result, if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or other variable rate debt would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.4 billion of our outstanding debt at variable interest rates.\nWe may be unable to service our indebtedness, including the notes.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors (many of which are beyond our control), including the availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. We cannot be certain that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes. Failure to successfully restructure or refinance our debt could cause us to default on our debt obligations and would impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations.\nMoreover, in the event of a default of our debt service obligations, the holders of the applicable indebtedness, including the notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. We cannot be certain that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. First, a default in our debt service obligations in respect of the notes would result in a cross default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The foregoing would permit the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility to terminate their commitments thereunder and cease making further loans, and would allow the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to declare all loans immediately due and payable and to institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. Second, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness under which the total amount of outstanding indebtedness exceeds $100 million could also result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes, and any event of default or declaration of acceleration under any other of our outstanding indebtedness may also contain a cross-default provision. Any such default, event of default or declaration of acceleration could materially and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Chemours Company\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness, including the notes, contain, and the agreements governing future indebtedness and future debt securities may contain, significant restrictive covenants and, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, financial maintenance covenants that will limit our operations, including our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. These restrictive covenants may limit us, and our restricted subsidiaries, from taking, or give rights to the holders of our indebtedness in the event of the following actions:\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness and guaranteeing indebtedness;\n\u2022\npaying dividends or making other distributions in respect of, or repurchasing or redeeming, our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmaking acquisitions or other investments;\n\u2022\nprepaying, redeeming or repurchasing certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\nselling or otherwise disposing of assets;\n\u2022\nselling stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nincurring liens;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nentering into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions that result in a change of control of us; and\n\u2022\nconsolidating, merging or selling all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of some or all of our indebtedness, which could lead us to bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expected to achieve from our separation from DuPont.\nAs an independent, publicly-traded company, we continue to, among other things, focus our financial and operational resources on our specific business, growth profile and strategic priorities, design and implement corporate strategies and policies targeted to our operational focus and strategic priorities, guide our processes and infrastructure to focus on our core strengths, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs and more effectively respond to industry dynamics, all of which are benefits we expected to achieve from our separation. However, we may be unable to fully achieve some or all of these benefits. For example, in order to position ourselves for the separation and distribution, we undertook a series of strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our operations. These actions may not provide the benefits we expected, and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit, key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses following the separation and distribution, weakening of our internal standards, controls or procedures and impairment of our key customer and supplier relationships. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expected to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expected, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability and stockholders receiving our common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant tax liability.\nDuPont received a ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution qualified as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). The tax-free nature of the distribution was conditioned on the continued validity of the IRS Ruling, as well as on receipt of a tax opinion, in form and substance acceptable to DuPont, substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution would qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, and certain transactions related to the transfer of assets and liabilities to us in connection with the separation and distribution would not result in the recognition of any gain or loss to DuPont, us or our stockholders. The IRS Ruling and the tax opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, and undertakings, and certain representations from DuPont and us, regarding the past and future conduct of both respective businesses and other matters, and the tax opinion relies on the IRS Ruling. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the tax opinion, the IRS could determine that the distribution or such related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or\nThe Chemours Company\nundertakings were not correct, or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinion that are not covered by the IRS Ruling.\nIf the distribution ultimately was determined to be taxable, then a stockholder of DuPont that received shares of our common stock in the distribution would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares on the distribution date and could incur significant income tax liabilities. Such distribution would be taxable to such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of DuPont\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Any amount that exceeded DuPont\u2019s earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of DuPont stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. DuPont would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares of our common stock held by DuPont on the distribution date over DuPont\u2019s tax basis in such shares. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and/or local tax law and/or foreign tax law, we and DuPont could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law.\nGenerally, taxes resulting from the failure of the separation and distribution or certain related transactions to qualify for non-recognition treatment under U.S. federal, state and/or local tax law and/or foreign tax law would be imposed on DuPont or DuPont\u2019s stockholders and, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with DuPont prior to the spin-off, DuPont is generally obligated to indemnify us against such taxes to the extent that we may be jointly, severally or secondarily liable for such taxes. However, under the terms of the tax matters agreement, we are also generally responsible for any taxes imposed on DuPont that arise from the failure of the distribution to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or the failure of such related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to our, or our affiliates\u2019, stock, assets or business, or any breach of our or our affiliates\u2019 representations, covenants or obligations under the tax matters agreement (or any other agreement we enter into in connection with the separation and distribution), the materials submitted to the IRS or other governmental authorities in connection with the request for the IRS Ruling or other tax rulings or the representation letter provided to counsel in connection with the tax opinion. Events triggering an indemnification obligation under the agreement include events occurring after the distribution that cause DuPont to recognize a gain under Section 355(e) of the Code. Such tax amounts could be significant. To the extent we are responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax-related liabilities of DuPont.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of DuPont may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of DuPont\u2019s consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for such taxable period. In connection with the separation and distribution, we entered into a tax matters agreement with DuPont that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of DuPont\u2019s consolidated tax reporting group between us and DuPont. If DuPont were unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, however, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state, local, or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nWe agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the tax-free treatment of the transactions in the U.S., which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nOur ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the distribution by DuPont. Even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, the distribution may result in corporate-level taxable gain to DuPont under Sections 355(e) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code if 50 percent or more, by vote or value, of shares of our stock or DuPont\u2019s stock are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. The process for determining whether an acquisition or issuance triggering these provisions has occurred is complex, inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. Any acquisitions or issuances of our stock or DuPont\u2019s stock within a two-year period after the distribution generally are presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or DuPont, as applicable, may be able to rebut that presumption. Accordingly, under the tax matters agreement entered into prior to the spin-off, for the two-year period following the distribution, we are prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from:\n\u2022\nentering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of 40 percent or more of our stock or substantially all of our assets, whether by merger or otherwise;\nThe Chemours Company\n\u2022\nmerging, consolidating or liquidating;\n\u2022\nissuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u2022\nrepurchasing our capital stock; or\n\u2022\nceasing to actively conduct our business.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions, including our transformation plans that we may believe to otherwise be in our best interests or that might increase the value of our business. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, we are required to indemnify DuPont against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of our stock or assets, even if we do not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price could become more volatile and investments could lose value.\nThe market price of our common stock and the number of shares traded each day has experienced significant fluctuations since our separation from DuPont and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates or our earnings guidance;\n\u2022\nanticipated or actual outcomes or resolutions of legal or other contingencies;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ncredit rating agency actions;\n\u2022\na change in our dividend or stock repurchase activities;\n\u2022\nchanges in rules or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations and domestic and worldwide economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nA significant drop or rise in our stock price could expose us to costly and time-consuming litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, resulting in an adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on our common stock in the future.\nThe declaration, payment and amount of any dividend are subject to the sole discretion of our board of directors and, in the context of our financial policy, will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition and prospects, our capital requirements and access to capital markets, covenants associated with certain of our debt obligations, legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant, and there can be no assurances that we will continue to pay a dividend in the future.\nA stockholder\u2019s percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nA stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership in us may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that we may be granting to our directors, officers and employees. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nThe Chemours Company\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of the common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe limited ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies (including those resulting from an enlargement of the board of directors) on our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that stockholders holding at least 80 percent of our voting stock are required to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporations Law (the DGCL). Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that (without prior board approval) acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliate becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if an acquisition proposal or offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests and our stockholders\u2019. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nSeveral of the agreements that we have entered into with DuPont require DuPont\u2019s consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations, or a change of control of us, under the agreements. The consent rights set forth in these agreements might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the tax matters agreement executed prior to the spin-off, we would be required to indemnify DuPont for the tax imposed under Section 355(e) of the Code resulting from an acquisition or issuance of its stock, even if it did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable. Please see the risk factor \u201cIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability and stockholders receiving our common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant tax liability.\u201d for further information.", "PERMNO": 15398, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "CC"}
