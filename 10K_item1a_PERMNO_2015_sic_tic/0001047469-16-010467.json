Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nRisks Related to our Business\nIf there are changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements for our services, our net operating revenues and profitability could decline.\nApproximately 46% of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, 45% of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 37% of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 came from the highly regulated federal Medicare program.\nIn recent years, through legislative and regulatory actions, the federal government has made substantial changes to various payment systems under the Medicare program. President Obama signed into law comprehensive reforms to the healthcare system, including changes to the methods for, and amounts of, Medicare reimbursement. Additional reforms or other changes to these payment systems, including modifications to the conditions on qualification for payment, bundling payments to cover both acute and post-acute care or the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers, may be proposed or could be adopted, either by Congress or CMS. If revised regulations are adopted, the availability, methods and rates of Medicare reimbursements for services of the type furnished at our facilities could change. Some of these changes and proposed changes could adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results. In addition, there can be no assurance that any increases in Medicare reimbursement rates established by CMS will fully reflect increases in our operating costs.\nThe BCA of 2011, enacted on August 2, 2011, increased the federal debt ceiling in connection with deficit reductions over the next ten years. The BCA of 2011 requires automatic reductions in federal spending by approximately $1.2 trillion split evenly between domestic and defense spending. Payments to Medicare providers are subject to these automatic spending reductions, subject to a 2% cap. On April 1, 2013 a 2% reduction to Medicare payments was implemented. The BBA of 2013 extended the automatic\nspending reductions through 2023 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 further extended the automatic spending reductions through fiscal year 2025.\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry, and changes in regulations, new interpretations of existing regulations or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that reduce our net operating revenues and profitability.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to (1) facility and professional licensure, including certificates of need, (2) conduct of operations, including financial relationships among healthcare providers, Medicare fraud and abuse and physician self-referral, (3) addition of facilities and services and enrollment of newly developed facilities in the Medicare program, (4) payment for services and (5) safeguarding protected health information.\nBoth federal and state regulatory agencies inspect, survey and audit our facilities to review our compliance with these laws and regulations. While our facilities intend to comply with existing licensing, Medicare certification requirements and accreditation standards, there can be no assurance that these regulatory authorities will determine that all applicable requirements are fully met at any given time. A determination by any of these regulatory authorities that a facility is not in compliance with these requirements could lead to the imposition of requirements that the facility takes corrective action, assessment of fines and penalties, or loss of licensure, Medicare certification or accreditation. These consequences could have an adverse effect on our company.\nIn addition, there have been heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state government agencies relating to the healthcare industry. The ongoing investigations relate to, among other things, various referral practices, cost reporting, billing practices, physician ownership and joint ventures involving hospitals. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject us to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services and capital expenditure programs. These changes may increase our operating expenses and reduce our operating revenues. If we fail to comply with these extensive laws and government regulations, we could become ineligible to receive government program reimbursement, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations. In addition, we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to any related investigation or other enforcement action.\nFull implementation of the Medicare 25 Percent Rule applicable to LTCHs will have an adverse effect on our future net operating revenues and profitability.\nUnder the 25 Percent Rule, the Medicare payment rate for LTCHs is subject to a downward payment adjustment if the percentage of Medicare patients discharged from an LTCH who were admitted from an individual referring hospital exceeds an applicable percentage admissions threshold during a particular cost reporting period. Cases admitted to an LTCH in excess of the applicable percentage admissions threshold are reimbursed at a rate comparable to that under IPPS. IPPS rates are generally lower than LTCH-PPS rates. Cases that reach outlier status in the discharging hospital do not count toward the limit and are paid under LTCH-PPS.\nLTCHs that are operated as HIHs or as HIH \"satellites,\" are subject to payment reductions for those Medicare patients admitted from their host hospitals in excess of the applicable percentage admissions threshold and from other referring hospitals in excess of the applicable percentage admissions threshold. LTCHs that are operated as freestanding facilities are subject to a payment reduction for those Medicare patients admitted from other referring hospitals in excess of the applicable admissions threshold. Grandfathered HIHs are excluded from the Medicare percentage admissions threshold regulations.\nThe SCHIP Extension Act, as amended by the ARRA, the ACA and the BBA of 2013, postponed the full application of the percentage admissions threshold for specific classifications of LTCHs. Full\nimplementation of the Medicare percentage admissions thresholds under the 25 Percent Rule will not go into effect until cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2016 or October 1, 2016, depending on the specific classification of LTCH. See \"Business-Government Regulations-Overview of U.S. and State Government Reimbursements-Long Term Acute Care Hospital Medicare Reimbursement-25 Percent Rule.\"\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 80 HIHs and satellite facilities of which three are grandfathered HIHs and are excluded from the percentage threshold regulations. Of the remaining 77 HIHs and satellite facilities subject to a percentage admissions threshold for admissions from their host hospital; nine of these HIHs and satellite facilities were subject to a maximum 25% Medicare percentage admissions threshold for admissions from their host hospital, five HIHs and satellite facilities are co-located with an MSA dominant hospital and were subject to a Medicare percentage admissions threshold of no more than 50%, nor less than 25%, 18 of these HIHs and satellite facilities were co-located with a MSA dominant hospital or single urban hospital and were subject to a Medicare percentage admissions threshold of no more than 75%, 44 of these HIHs and satellite facilities were subject to a maximum 50% Medicare admissions threshold, and one of these HIHs and satellite facilities was located in a rural area and was subject to a maximum 75% Medicare percentage admissions threshold. As of December 31, 2015, we owned three grandfathered HIHs, all of which are excluded from the percentage admissions threshold regulations. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 28 free-standing LTCHs, which are not subject to the Medicare percentage admissions threshold until cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2016.\nThe BBA of 2013 requires CMS to report to Congress before October 2016 on the need for any further extensions or modifications of the extensions of the 25 Percent Rule. In addition, the BBA of 2013 requires MedPAC, an independent federal body that advises Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program, to report to Congress by June 2019 on the need to continue applying the 25 Percent Rule, the effect of site-neutral payment on LTCHs and recommendations on how to change the site-neutral payment policy.\nBecause these rules are complex and are based on the volume of Medicare admissions from other referring hospitals as a percent of our overall Medicare admissions, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on our future net operating revenues and profitability of compliance with these regulations. We expect many of our LTCHs will experience an adverse financial impact when full implementation of the Medicare percentage admissions thresholds goes into effect. Our LTCHs have cost reporting periods that commence on various dates throughout the calendar year. Therefore, the application of the lower percentage admissions thresholds will be staggered and we would not realize the full impact of lower percentage admissions thresholds until 2017.\nIf our LTCHs fail to maintain their certifications as LTCHs or if our facilities operated as HIHs fail to qualify as hospitals separate from their host hospitals, our net operating revenues and profitability may decline.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we operated 109 LTCHs, 108 of which are currently certified by Medicare as LTCHs and one which is currently awaiting certification. LTCHs must meet certain conditions of participation to enroll in, and seek payment from, the Medicare program as an LTCH, including, among other things, maintaining an average length of stay for Medicare patients in excess of 25 days. An LTCH that fails to maintain this average length of stay for Medicare patients in excess of 25 days during a single cost reporting period is generally allowed an opportunity to show that it meets the length of stay criteria during a subsequent cure period. If the LTCH can show that it meets the length of stay criteria during this cure period, it will continue to be paid under the LTCH-PPS. If the LTCH again fails to meet the average length of stay criteria during the cure period, it will be paid under the general acute care IPPS at rates generally lower than the rates under the LTCH-PPS.\nSimilarly, our HIHs must meet conditions of participation in the Medicare program, which include additional criteria establishing separateness from the hospital with which the HIH shares space. If our\nLTCHs or HIHs fail to meet or maintain the standards for certification as LTCHs, they will receive payment under the general acute care hospitals IPPS which is generally lower than payment under the system applicable to LTCHs. Payments at rates applicable to general acute care hospitals would result in our LTCHs receiving significantly less Medicare reimbursement than they currently receive for their patient services.\nImplementation of additional patient or facility criteria for LTCHs that limit the population of patients eligible for our hospitals' services or change the basis on which we are paid could adversely affect our net operating revenue and profitability.\nThe BBA of 2013 establishes new payment limits for Medicare patients who do not meet specified criteria. Specifically, for Medicare patients discharged in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015, LTCHs will be reimbursed under LTCH-PPS only if, immediately preceding the patient's LTCH admission, the patient was discharged from a general acute care hospital paid under IPPS and the patient's stay included at least three days in an intensive care unit (ICU) or coronary care unit (CCU) or the patient is assigned to an MS-LTC-DRG for cases receiving at least 96 hours of ventilator services in the LTCH. In addition, to be paid under LTCH-PPS the patient's discharge from the LTCH may not include a principal diagnosis relating to psychiatric or rehabilitation services. For any Medicare patient who does not meet the new criteria, the LTCH will be paid a \"site-neutral\" payment rate, which will be the lower of (1) the IPPS comparable per-diem payment rate including any outlier payments, or (2) 100 percent of the estimated costs for services. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019, payment for all discharges from an LTCH may be subject to the site-neutral payment limitation unless the number of discharges for which payment is made under the LTCH-PPS payment rate is greater than 50% of the total number of discharges for the LTCH. The application of the new site-neutral payment rates under LTCH-PPS may reduce our operating revenues.\nCMS requested public comments in May of 2013 on adoption of a payment adjustment based on whether a particular case qualifies as chronically critically ill/medically complex (\"CCI/MC\"). CMS indicated that it was considering a change to the LTCH-PPS payment policies that would limit full LTCH-PPS payment to those patients meeting the definition of CCI/MC while they were in an IPPS hospital inpatient setting and subsequently directly admitted to an LTCH. Payment for non-CCI/MC patients would be made at an \"IPPS comparable amount,\" that is, an amount comparable to what would have been paid under the IPPS calculated as a per diem rate with total payments capped at the full IPPS MS-DRG payment rate.\nIt is unclear how the adoption of the BBA of 2013 will impact regulatory or legislative proposals to change the LTCH-PPS payment policies. We cannot predict whether Congress or CMS will adopt additional patient-level criteria in the future or, if adopted, how such criteria would affect our LTCHs. Implementation of additional patient or facility criteria that may limit the population of patients eligible for our LTCHs' services or change the basis on which we are paid could adversely affect our net operating revenues and profitability. See \"Business-Government Regulations-Overview of U.S. and State Government Reimbursements-Long Term Acute Care Hospital Medicare Reimbursement.\"\nDecreases in Medicare reimbursement rates received by our outpatient rehabilitation clinics, implementation of annual caps, and payment reductions applied to the second and subsequent therapy services may reduce our future net operating revenues and profitability.\nOur outpatient rehabilitation clinics receive payments from the Medicare program under a fee schedule. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 requires that payments under the fee schedule be adjusted starting in 2019 based on performance in a new Merit-Based Incentive Payment System and, beginning in 2020, incentives for participation in alternative payment models. The specifics of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System and incentives for participation in alternative payment models will be subject to future notice and comment rule-making. It is unclear what impact, if any, the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System and incentives for participation in alternative payment models will have on our business and operating results, but any resulting decrease in payment may reduce our future net operating revenues and profitability.\nCongress has established annual caps that limit the amount that can be paid (including deductible and coinsurance amounts) for outpatient therapy services rendered to any Medicare beneficiary. As directed by Congress in the DRA, CMS implemented an exception process for therapy expenses incurred in 2006. Under this process, a Medicare enrollee (or person acting on behalf of the Medicare enrollee) was able to request an exception from the therapy caps if the provision of therapy services was deemed to be medically necessary. Therapy cap exceptions were available automatically for certain conditions and on a case by case basis upon submission of documentation of medical necessity. The exception process has been extended by Congress several times. Most recently, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 extends the exceptions process for outpatient therapy caps through December 31, 2017. The exception process will expire on December 31, 2017 unless further extended by Congress. There can be no assurance that Congress will extend it further. To date, the implementation of the therapy caps has not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, if the exception process is not renewed, our future net operating revenues and profitability may decline.\nCMS adopted a multiple procedure payment reduction for therapy services in the final update to the Medicare physician fee schedule for calendar year 2011. Under the policy, the Medicare program pays 100% of the practice expense component of the therapy procedure or unit of service with the highest Relative Value Unit, and then reduces the payment for the practice expense component for the second and subsequent therapy procedures or units of service furnished during the same day for the same patient, regardless of whether those therapy services are furnished in separate sessions. In 2011 and 2012 the second and subsequent therapy service furnished during the same day for the same patient was reduced by 20% in office and other non institutional settings and by 25% in institutional settings. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 increased the payment reduction to 50% effective April 1, 2013. Should CMS adopt further increases in the payment reduction percentage our future net operating revenues and profitability would decline.\nThe nature of the markets that Concentra serves may constrain its ability to raise prices at rates sufficient to keep pace with the inflation of its costs.\nRates of reimbursement for work-related injury or illness visits in Concentra's occupational health services business are established through a legislative or regulatory process within each state that Concentra serves. Currently, 32 states have fee schedules pursuant to which all healthcare providers are uniformly reimbursed. The fee schedules are determined by each state and generally prescribe the maximum amounts that may be reimbursed for a designated procedure. In the states without fee schedules, healthcare providers are generally reimbursed based on usual, customary and reasonable rates charged in the particular state in which the services are provided. Given that Concentra does not control these processes, it may be subject to financial risks if individual jurisdictions reduce rates or do not routinely raise rates of reimbursement in a manner that keeps pace with the inflation of Concentra's costs of service.\nIn Concentra's veteran's healthcare business, reimbursement rates are generally set according to the capitated monthly rate based on the number of then enrolled patients at that CBOC. Evolving legislative and regulatory changes aimed at improving veteran's access to care in the wake of Department of Veterans Affairs scandals (none of which involved Concentra's CBOCs) could result in fewer patients enrolling in CBOCs. Federal legislation that permits certain veterans to receive their health care outside of the Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, for example, may reduce demand for services at some of Concentra's CBOCs. Moreover, changes in the methods, manner or amounts of compensation payable for Concentra's services, including, amounts reimbursable to the CBOCs under its agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs, due to legislative or other changes or shifting budget priorities could result in lower reimbursement for services provided at Concentra's CBOCs. Concentra may receive lower payments from the Veterans Health Administration if fewer eligible veterans are considered to live within the catchments of its CBOCs. These trends could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations limiting the diagnosis codes on the presumptive compliance list could adversely affect our net operating revenue and profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we operated 18 IRFs, 17 of which are currently certified by Medicare as IRFs and one which is in the process of obtaining its certification. IRFs must meet certain conditions of participation to enroll in, and seek payment from, the Medicare program as an IRF. Among other things, at least 60% of the IRF's total inpatient population must require treatment for one or more of 13 conditions specified by regulation. This requirement is now commonly referred to as the \"60% Rule.\" Compliance with the 60% Rule is demonstrated through a two step process. The first step is the \"presumptive\" method, in which patient diagnosis codes are compared to a \"presumptive compliance\" list. IRFs that fail to demonstrate compliance with the 60% Rule using this presumptive test may demonstrate compliance through a second step involving an audit of the facility's medical records to assess compliance.\nEffective October 1, 2015, CMS removed a number of diagnosis codes from the presumptive compliance list including diagnosis codes in the following categories: nonspecific diagnosis codes, arthritis diagnosis codes, unilateral upper extremity amputations diagnosis codes, amputation status codes, prosthetic fitting and adjustment codes, some congenital anomalies diagnosis codes and other miscellaneous diagnosis codes. According to CMS, these conditions do not demonstrate the need for intensive inpatient rehabilitation services in the absence of additional facts that would have to be pulled from a patient's medical record. If an IRF does not demonstrate compliance with the 60% Rule by either the presumptive method or through a review of medical records, then the facility's classification as an IRF may be terminated at the start of its next cost reporting period causing the facility to be paid as a general acute care hospital under IPPS. By removing diagnosis codes from the presumptive compliance list our facilities may be required to demonstrate compliance with the 60% Rule through medical record reviews. If our IRFs fail to demonstrate compliance with the 60% Rule through either method and are classified as general acute care hospitals, our net operating revenue and profitability may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of increased post-payment reviews of claims we submit to Medicare for our services, we may incur additional costs and may be required to repay amounts already paid to us.\nWe are subject to regular post-payment inquiries, investigations and audits of the claims we submit to Medicare for payment for our services. These post-payment reviews are increasing as a result of new government cost-containment initiatives, including enhanced medical necessity reviews for Medicare patients admitted to our specialty hospitals, and audits of Medicare claims under the Recovery Audit Contractor program. These additional post-payment reviews may require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and to pursue the reversal of payment denials, and ultimately may require us to refund amounts paid to us by Medicare that are determined to have been overpaid.\nOur facilities are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations relating to the privacy of individually identifiable information.\nHIPAA required the United States Department of Health and Human Services to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. The department released final regulations containing privacy standards in December of 2000 and published revisions to the final regulations in August 2002. The privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information. The regulations also provide patients with significant new rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed. The security regulations require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically. HITECH, which was signed into law in February of 2009, enhanced the privacy, security and enforcement provisions of HIPAA by, among other things, establishing security breach notification requirements, allowing enforcement of HIPAA by state attorneys general, and increasing\npenalties for HIPAA violations. Violations of HIPAA or HITECH could result in civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition to HIPAA, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access or theft of patient's identifiable health information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state. Lawsuits, including class actions and action by state attorneys general, directed at companies that have experienced a privacy or security breach also can occur.\nIn the conduct of our business, we process, maintain and transmit sensitive data, including our patient's individually identifiable health information. We have developed a comprehensive set of policies and procedures in our efforts to comply with HIPAA and other privacy laws. Our compliance officer, privacy officer and information security officer are responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with our privacy and security policies and procedures at our facilities. We believe that the cost of our compliance with HIPAA and other federal and state privacy laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that a breach of privacy or security will not occur. If there is a breach, we may be subject to various lawsuits, penalties and damages and may be required to incur costs to mitigate the impact of the breach on affected individuals.\nWe may be adversely affected by a security breach of our, or our third-party vendor's, information technology systems, such as a cyber attack, which may cause a violation of HIPAA or HITECH and subject us to potential legal and reputational harm.\nIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information, which is subject to HIPAA and HITECH. Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information, maintaining an accurate record of all transactions, processing payments and maintaining our employee's personal information. We also contract with third-party vendors to maintain and store our patient's individually identifiable health information. Numerous state and federal laws and regulations address privacy and information security concerns resulting from our access to our patient's and employee's personal information.\nOur information technology systems and those of our vendors that process, maintain and transmit such data are subject to computer viruses, cyber attacks or breaches. We adhere to policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with HIPAA and other privacy and information security laws and require our third-party vendors to do so as well. If, however, we or our third-party vendors experience a breach, loss, or other compromise of unsecured protected health information or other personal information, such an event could result in significant civil and criminal penalties, lawsuits, reputational harm and increased costs to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, while our information technology systems, and those of our third-party vendors, are maintained with safeguards protecting against cyber attacks, including passive intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber attack could not occur. A cyber attack that bypasses our information technology security systems, or those of our third-party vendors, could cause the loss of protected health information, or other data subject to privacy laws, the loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption to our or a third-party vendor's information technology business systems resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of protected health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information, operational or business delays resulting from the\ndisruption of information technology systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities, negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with clients, members, or industry peers, or regulatory action taken as a result of such incident.\nWe may be adversely affected by negative publicity which can result in increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny and possibly adverse regulatory changes.\nNegative press coverage can result in increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny and possibly adverse regulatory changes. Adverse publicity and increased governmental scrutiny can have a negative impact on our reputation with referral sources and patients and on the morale and performance of our employees, both of which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions or expansions may use significant resources, may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of specialty hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics and other related healthcare facilities and services, and increase the number of Concentra medical centers, onsite clinics and CBOCs that Concentra operates. These acquisitions or expansions, including the pending acquisition of Physiotherapy Associates Holdings, Inc. (\"Physiotherapy), may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, additional operating losses and expenses and compliance risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, such as Physiotherapy, into ours, and therefore we may not be able to realize the intended benefits from an acquisition or expansion. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions and expansions into our operations, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Acquisitions could result in difficulties integrating acquired operations, technologies and personnel into our business. Such difficulties may divert significant financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing operations and make it more difficult to achieve our operating and strategic objectives. We may fail to retain employees or patients acquired through acquisitions, which may negatively impact the integration efforts. Acquisitions could also have a negative impact on our results of operations if it is subsequently determined that goodwill or other acquired intangible assets are impaired, thus resulting in an impairment charge in a future period. Further expansions may require substantial financial resources and management attention, and diverting these resources may negatively affect our financial results.\nIn addition, acquisitions, such as Physiotherapy, and expansions involve risks that the acquired businesses or expanded operations will not perform in accordance with expectations; that we may become liable for unforeseen financial or business liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare regulations; that the expected synergies associated with acquisitions or expansions will not be achieved; and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired or expanded operations will prove incorrect, which could have an material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to raise the financing for the acquisition of Physiotherapy and Physiotherapy terminates the merger agreement, we will be required to pay a termination fee.\nWe intend to finance the acquisition of Physiotherapy with proceeds from a proposed senior secured incremental term facility under Select's existing credit facilities, for which JP Morgan Chase, N.A. has provided us with a debt commitment letter. Should the merger agreement be terminated by Physiotherapy under specified conditions, including circumstances where we are required to close the transaction under the merger agreement and there is a failure of the debt financing to be funded in accordance with the terms of the debt commitment letter, a reverse termination fee of $24.0 million would be payable by us to Physiotherapy.\nRisks associated with our potential international operations.\nWe intend to expand our operations into other countries. International operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The risks that our potential international operations would be subject to include, among other things: difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations; fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies; repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States; foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income; separate operating and financial systems; disaster recovery; and unexpected regulatory, economic and political changes in foreign markets. In addition to the foregoing, our potential international operations will face risks associated with complying with laws governing our foreign business operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and applicable regulatory requirements.\nFuture joint ventures may use significant resources, may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may partner with large health care systems to provide post acute care services. These joint ventures may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, additional operating losses and expenses, and compliance risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA joint venture involves the combining of corporate cultures and mission. As a result, we may not be able to successfully operate a joint venture, and therefore we may not be able to realize the intended benefits. If we fail to successfully execute a joint venture relationship, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. A new joint venture could result in difficulties in combining operations, technologies and personnel. Such difficulties may divert significant financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing operations and make it more difficult to achieve our operating and strategic objectives. We may fail to retain employees or patients as a result of the integration efforts.\nA joint venture is operated through a board of directors that contains representatives of Select and other parties to the joint venture. We may not control the board or some actions of the board may require supermajority votes. As a result, the joint venture may elect certain actions that could have adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition may limit our ability to acquire hospitals, clinics and medical centers and adversely affect our growth.\nWe have historically faced limited competition in acquiring specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics, but we may face heightened competition in the future. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in Concentra's industry. Our competitors may acquire or seek to acquire many of the hospitals, clinics and medical centers that would be suitable acquisition candidates for us. This increased competition could hamper our ability to acquire companies, or such increased competition may cause us to pay a higher price than we would otherwise pay in a less competitive environment. Increased competition from both strategic and financial buyers could limit our ability to grow by acquisitions or make our cost of acquisitions higher and therefore decrease our profitability.\nIf we fail to compete effectively with other hospitals, clinics, medical centers and healthcare providers in the local areas we serve, our net operating revenues and profitability may decline.\nThe healthcare business is highly competitive, and we compete with other hospitals, rehabilitation clinics, medical centers and other healthcare providers for patients. If we are unable to compete effectively in the specialty hospital, outpatient rehabilitation and occupational health services businesses, our ability to retain customers and physicians, or maintain or increase our revenue growth, price flexibility, control\nover medical cost trends and marketing expenses may be compromised and our net operating revenues and profitability may decline.\nMany of our specialty hospitals operate in geographic areas where we compete with at least one other hospital that provides similar services.\nOur outpatient rehabilitation clinics face competition from a variety of local and national outpatient rehabilitation providers, including physician-owned physical therapy clinics, dedicated locally owned and managed outpatient rehabilitation clinics and hospital or university owned or affiliated ventures, as well as national and regional providers in select areas. Other competing outpatient rehabilitation clinics in local areas we serve may have greater name recognition and longer operating histories than our clinics. The managers of these competing clinics may also have stronger relationships with physicians in their communities, which could give them a competitive advantage for patient referrals. Because the barriers to entry are not substantial and current customers have the flexibility to move easily to new healthcare service providers, we believe that new outpatient physical therapy competitors can emerge relatively quickly.\nConcentra's primary competitors have typically been independent physicians, hospital emergency departments and hospital-owned or hospital-affiliated medical facilities. Because the barriers to entry in Concentra's geographic markets are not substantial and its current customers have the flexibility to move easily to new healthcare service providers, new competitors to Concentra can emerge relatively quickly. The markets for Concentra's consumer health and veteran's healthcare businesses are also fragmented and competitive. If Concentra's competitors are better able to attract patients or expand services at their facilities than Concentra is, Concentra may experience an overall decline in revenue. Similarly, competitive pricing pressures from our competitors could cause Concentra to lose existing or future CBOC contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which may also cause Concentra to experience an overall decline in revenue.\nFuture cost containment initiatives undertaken by private third-party payors may limit our future net operating revenues and profitability.\nInitiatives undertaken by major insurers and managed care companies to contain healthcare costs affect the profitability of our specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics. These payors attempt to control healthcare costs by contracting with hospitals and other healthcare providers to obtain services on a discounted basis. We believe that this trend may continue and may limit reimbursements for healthcare services. If insurers or managed care companies from whom we receive substantial payments reduce the amounts they pay for services, our profit margins may decline, or we may lose patients if we choose not to renew our contracts with these insurers at lower rates.\nIf we fail to maintain established relationships with the physicians in the areas we serve, our net operating revenues may decrease.\nOur success is partially dependent upon the admissions and referral practices of the physicians in the communities our hospitals and our outpatient rehabilitation clinics serve, and our ability to maintain good relations with these physicians. Physicians referring patients to our hospitals and clinics are generally not our employees and, in many of the local areas that we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals and are free to refer their patients to other providers. If we are unable to successfully cultivate and maintain strong relationships with these physicians, our hospitals' admissions and clinics' businesses may decrease, and our net operating revenues may decline.\nChanges in federal or state law limiting or prohibiting certain physician referrals may preclude physicians from investing in our hospitals or referring to hospitals in which they already own an interest.\nThe Stark Law prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship with an entity from referring his or her Medicare or Medicaid patients to that entity for certain designated health services, including\ninpatient and outpatient hospital services. Under the transparency and program integrity provisions of the ACA, the exception to the Stark Law that previously permitted physicians to refer patients to hospitals in which they have an ownership or investment interest has been dramatically curtailed. Only hospitals, including specialty hospitals, with physician ownership and a provider agreement in place on December 31, 2010 are exempt from the general ban on self-referral. Existing physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the percentage of physician ownership or investment interests held in the hospital after March 23, 2010. In addition, physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the number of licensed beds after March 23, 2010, unless meeting specific exceptions related to the hospital's location and patient population. In order to retain their exemption from the general ban on self-referrals, our physician owned hospitals are required to adopt specific measures relating to conflicts of interest, bona fide investments and patient safety. Furthermore, initiatives are underway in some states to restrict physician referrals to physician-owned hospitals. Currently, 10 of our consolidating hospitals have physicians as minority owners. The aggregate net operating revenue of these 10 hospitals was $176.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 4.7% of our consolidated net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. The range of physician minority ownership of these 10 hospitals was 2.1% to 38.7% as of the year ended December 31, 2015. There can be no assurance that new legislation or regulation prohibiting or limiting physician referrals to physician-owned hospitals will not be successfully enacted in the future. If such federal or state laws are adopted, among other outcomes, physicians who have invested in our hospitals could be precluded from referring to, investing in or continuing to be physician owners of a hospital. In addition, expansion of our physician-owned hospitals may be limited, and the revenues, profitability and overall financial performance of our hospitals may be negatively affected.\nWe could experience significant increases to our operating costs due to shortages of healthcare professionals or union activity.\nOur specialty hospitals are highly dependent on nurses, our outpatient rehabilitation division is highly dependent on therapists for patient care, and Concentra is highly dependent upon the ability of its affiliated professional groups to recruit and retain qualified physicians and other licensed providers. The market for qualified healthcare professionals is highly competitive. We have sometimes experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified healthcare personnel. We cannot assure you we will be able to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals in the future. Additionally, the cost of attracting and retaining qualified healthcare personnel may be higher than we anticipate, and as a result, our profitability could decline.\nIn addition, U.S. healthcare providers are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity. Though we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by future union activity, there are continuing legislative proposals that could result in increased union activity. We could experience an increase in labor and other costs from such union activity.\nOur business operations could be significantly disrupted if we lose key members of our management team.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior officers and other key employees, and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. We currently have employment agreements in place with three executive officers and change in control agreements and/or non-competition agreements with several other officers. Many of these individuals also have significant equity ownership in our company. We do not maintain any key life insurance policies for any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could disrupt significant aspects of our business, could prevent us from successfully executing our business strategy and could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations.\nIn conducting our business, we are required to comply with applicable laws regarding fee-splitting and the corporate practice of medicine.\nSome states prohibit the \"corporate practice of medicine\" that restricts business corporations from practicing medicine through the direct employment of physicians or from exercising control over medical decisions by physicians. Some states similarly prohibit the \"corporate practice of therapy.\" The laws relating to corporate practice vary from state to state and are not fully developed in each state in which we have facilities. Typically, however, professional corporations owned and controlled by licensed professionals are exempt from corporate practice restrictions and may employ physicians or therapists to furnish professional services. Also, in some states hospitals are permitted to employ physicians.\nSome states also prohibit entities from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians or therapists. The laws relating to fee-splitting also vary from state to state and are not fully developed. Generally, these laws restrict business arrangements that involve a physician or therapist sharing medical fees with a referral source, but in some states these laws have been interpreted to extend to management agreements between physicians or therapists and business entities under some circumstances.\nWe believe that the Company's current and planned activities do not constitute fee-splitting or the unlawful corporate practice of medicine as contemplated by these state laws. However, there can be no assurance that future interpretations of such laws will not require structural and organizational modification of our existing relationships with the practices. If a court or regulatory body determines that we have violated these laws or if new laws are introduced that would render our arrangements illegal, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable (in whole or in part), or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements with our affiliated physicians and other licensed providers.\nIf Concentra is unable to implement and enhance its information systems in a manner that leverages its knowledge of the workers' compensation market and or more efficiently process and manage claims, results may be adversely affected.\nTo leverage its knowledge of workplace injuries, treatment protocols, outcomes data and complex regulatory provisions related to the workers' compensation market, Concentra must continue to implement and enhance information systems that can analyze its data related to the workers' compensation industry. Concentra frequently upgrades existing operating systems and is updating other information systems upon which it relies. Concentra has detailed implementation schedules for these projects that require extensive involvement from its operational, technological and financial personnel. Delays or other problems Concentra might encounter in implementing these projects could adversely affect its ability to deliver streamlined patient care and outcome reporting to its customers.\nIn addition, Concentra expects that a considerable amount of its future growth will depend on its ability to process and manage claims data more efficiently and to provide more meaningful healthcare information to customers and payors of healthcare. There can be no assurance that Concentra's current data processing capabilities will be adequate for its future growth, that it will be able to efficiently upgrade its systems to meet future demands, or that it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire software to address these market demands as well or as timely as its competitors.\nIf the frequency of workplace injuries and illnesses continues to decline, Concentra's results may be negatively affected.\nApproximately 52% of Concentra's revenue in 2015 was generated from the treatment or review of workers' compensation claims. In the past decade, the number of workers' compensation claims has decreased, which Concentra primarily attributes to improvements in workplace safety, improved risk management by employers and changes in the type and composition of jobs. During the economic\ndownturn, the number of employees with workers' compensation insurance substantially decreased. Although the number of covered employees has increased more in recent years as the employment rate has increased, adverse economic conditions can cause the number of covered employees to decline which can cause further declines in workers' compensation claims. There may also be a decrease in claims because more workers have access to health insurance since the enactment of the ACA and are less likely to file worker's compensation claims. In addition, because of the greater access to health insurance and the fact that the U.S. economy has continued to shift from a manufacturing-based to a service-based economy along with general improvements in workplace safety, workers are generally healthier and less prone to work injuries. Increases in employer-sponsored wellness and health promotion programs, spurred in part by the ACA, have led to fitter and healthier employees who may be less likely to injure themselves on the job. Concentra's business model is based, in part, on its ability to expand its relative share of the market for the treatment and review of claims for workplace injuries and illnesses. If workplace injuries and illnesses decline at a greater rate than the increase in total employment or if total employment declines at a greater rate than the increase in incident rates, the number of claims in the workers' compensation market will decrease and may adversely affect Concentra's business.\nIf Concentra loses several significant employer customers, its results may be adversely affected.\nConcentra's results may decline if it loses several significant employer customers in a short period. Most of Concentra's customer agreements permit either party to terminate without cause upon 30, 60 or 90 days' prior written notice. If several significant employer customers terminate, or do not renew or extend their agreements with Concentra, its results could be adversely affected. One or more of Concentra's significant employer customers could be acquired. Additionally, Concentra could lose significant employer customers due to competitive pricing pressures or other reasons. The loss of several significant employer customers could cause a material decline in Concentra's profitability and operating performance.\nWe may not receive payment from some of our patients because of their financial circumstances.\nSome of our patients may not have significant financial resources, liquidity or access to capital. If these patients experience financial difficulties they may be unable to pay for the healthcare services that we will provide, including their copays or deductibles. A significant deterioration in general or local economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the financial health of our patients, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities.\nPhysicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice, product liability or related legal theories. Many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs. We are also subject to lawsuits under federal and state whistleblower statutes designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These whistleblower lawsuits are not covered by insurance and can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring the suits. See \"Legal Proceedings\" and Note 14 in our audited consolidated financial statements.\nWe currently maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverages under a combination of policies with a total annual aggregate limit of $35.0 million. Our insurance for the professional liability coverage is written on a \"claims-made\" basis and our commercial general liability coverage is maintained on an \"occurrence\" basis. These coverages apply after a self-insured retention of $2.0 million per medical incident for professional liability claims and $2.0 million per occurrence for general liability claims. We review our insurance program annually and may make adjustments to the amount of insurance coverage and self-insured retentions in future years. In addition, our insurance coverage does not generally cover punitive damages and may not cover all claims against us. See \"Business-Government Regulations-Other Healthcare Regulations.\"\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executives and directors may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executives and directors, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 19.6% of Holdings' outstanding common stock as of February 1, 2016. As a result, these stockholders have significant control over our management and policies and are able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. The directors elected by these stockholders are able to make decisions affecting our capital structure, including decisions to issue additional capital stock, implement stock repurchase programs and incur indebtedness. This influence may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest.\nRisks Related to our Capital Structure\nIf WCAS and the other members of Group Holdings exercise their Put Right, it may have an adverse effect on our liquidity. Additionally, we may not have adequate funds to pay amounts due in connection with the Put Right, if exercised, in which case we would be required to issue Holdings' common stock to purchase interests of Group Holdings and our stockholder's ownership interest will be diluted.\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Group Holdings, WCAS and the other members of Group Holdings have a put right (the \"Put Right\") with respect to their equity interests in Group Holdings. If a Put Right is exercised by WCAS, Select will be obligated to purchase up to 331/3% of the equity interests of Group Holdings that WCAS purchased on June 1, 2015, at a purchase price based on a valuation of Group Holdings performed by an investment bank to be mutually agreed between Select and WCAS, which valuation will be based on certain precedent transactions using multiples of EBITDA and capped at an agreed upon multiple of EBITDA. Select has the right to elect to pay the purchase price in cash or in shares of Holdings' common stock. WCAS may first exercise its Put Right after June 1, 2018, and then may exercise its Put Right again annually during each fiscal year thereafter. If WCAS exercises its Put Right, the other members of Group Holdings may elect to sell to Select, on the same terms as WCAS, a percentage of their equity interests of Group Holdings that such member purchased on June 1, 2015, up to but not exceeding the percentage of its initial equity interests that WCAS has determined to sell to Select in the exercise of its Put Right.\nFurthermore, WCAS and the other members of Group Holdings will have a put right with respect to their equity interest in Group Holdings in the event Holdings or Select experiences a change of control that has not been previously approved by WCAS and which results in change in the senior management of Select (an \"SEM COC Put Right\"). If an SEM COC Put Right is exercised by WCAS, WCAS and each other member of Group Holdings will be obligated to sell all (but not less than all) of their equity interests in Group Holdings to Select, at a purchase price based on a valuation of Group Holdings performed by an investment bank to be mutually agreed between Select and WCAS, which valuation will be based on certain precedent transactions using multiples of EBITDA and capped at an agreed upon multiple of EBITDA.\nWe may not have sufficient funds, borrowing capacity or other capital resources available to pay for the interests of Group Holdings in cash if WCAS and the other members of Group Holdings exercise their Put Rights or maybe prohibited from doing so under the terms of our debt agreements. Such lack of available funds upon the exercising of the Put Rights would force us to issue stock at a time we might not otherwise desire to do so in order to purchase the interests of Group Holdings. To the extent that the interests of Group Holdings are purchased by issuing shares of our common stock, the increase in the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding may depress the price of our common stock and our stockholders will experience dilution in their respective percentage ownership in us. In addition, shares issued to purchase the interests in Group Holdings will be valued at the twenty-one trading day\nvolume-weighted average sales price of such shares for the period beginning ten trading days immediately preceding the first public announcement of the Put Right being exercised and ending ten trading days immediately following such announcement. Because the value of the common stock issued to purchase the interests in Group Holdings is, in part, determined by the sales price of our common stock following the announcement that the Put Right is being exercised, which may cause the sales price of our common stock to decline, the amount of common stock we may have to issue to purchase the interests in Group Holdings may increase, resulting in further dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOur substantial indebtedness may limit the amount of cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, Select had approximately $1,768.7 million of total indebtedness excluding the debt at Concentra. Taking into account the indebtedness under the Concentra credit facilities (as defined below), which is nonrecourse to Select, our total indebtedness at December 31, 2015 was $2,423.9 million. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, Select paid cash interest of $89.1 million and $78.8 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Select paid cash interest, including cash interest paid by Concentra on Concentra's indebtedness, of $103.2 million. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it:\n\u2022 requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 increases our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022 limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022 makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates;\n\u2022 limits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes; and\n\u2022 places us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nAny of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. In addition, there would be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, as needed.\nSee \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nOur credit facilities and the indenture governing Select's 6.375% senior notes require us to comply with certain financial covenants and obligations, the default of which may result in the acceleration of certain of our indebtedness.\nIn the case of an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, the lenders under these agreements could elect to declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable. If we are unable to obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under such circumstances, the lenders could exercise their rights as described above, then our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we could become bankrupt or insolvent.\nThe Select credit facilities (as defined below) require Select to maintain a leverage ratio (based upon the ratio of indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the agreement), which is tested quarterly. The Select credit facilities also prohibit Select from making capital expenditures in excess of $125.0 million in any fiscal year (subject to a 50% carry-over provision). Failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default under the Select credit facilities and, absent a waiver or an amendment from the lenders, preclude Select from making further borrowings under its revolving facility and permit the lenders to accelerate all outstanding borrowings under the Select credit facilities.\nThe Concentra first lien credit agreement (as defined below) requires Concentra to maintain a leverage ratio (based upon the ratio of indebtedness for money borrowed to consolidated EBITDA) of 5.25 to 1.00, which is tested quarterly, but only if Revolving Exposure (as defined in the Concentra credit facilities (as defined below)) exceeds 30% of Revolving Commitments (as defined in the Concentra credit facilities) on such day. Failure to comply with this covenant would result in an event of default under the Concentra revolving facility (as defined below) only and, absent a waiver or an amendment from the lenders, preclude Concentra from making further borrowings under the Concentra revolving facility and permit the lenders to accelerate all outstanding borrowings under the Concentra revolving facility. Upon such acceleration, Concentra's failure to comply with the financial covenant would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the Concentra credit facilities) with respect to the Concentra first lien term loan (as defined below).\nThe Concentra credit facilities also contain a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants, including limitations on mergers, consolidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; investments and acquisitions; indebtedness; liens; affiliate transactions; and dividends and restricted payments. The Concentra credit facilities contain events of default for non-payment of principal and interest when due (subject to a grace period for interest), cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions and an event of default that would be triggered by a change of control.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Select was required to maintain its leverage ratio (its ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters) at less than 5.75 to 1.00. For the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2015, Select's leverage ratio was 4.78 to 1.00.\nWhile we have never defaulted on compliance with any of our financial covenants, our ability to comply with these ratios in the future may be affected by events beyond our control. Inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness. In the event of any default under Select's credit facilities, the lenders could elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. In the event of any default under Select's indenture, the trustee or holders of 25% of the notes could declare all outstanding 6.375% senior notes immediately due and payable.\nPayment of interest on, and repayment of principal of, our indebtedness is dependent in part on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nPayment of interest on, and repayment of principal of our indebtedness will be dependent in part upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. For example, as a general matter, Concentra is restricted from paying dividends under the Concentra credit facilities and therefore we cannot rely on Concentra's cash flow to repay Select's indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. In addition, any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our subsidiaries to us could be subject to\nrestrictions on dividends or repatriation of distributions under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate or under arrangements with local partners. Furthermore, the ability of our subsidiaries to make such payments of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or advances may be contested by taxing authorities in the relevant jurisdictions.\nDespite our substantial level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Select credit facilities and the Concentra credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, Select had $116.1 million of availability under the Select revolving facility (as defined below) (after giving effect to $38.9 million of outstanding letters of credit) and Concentra had $39.0 million of availability under the Concentra revolving facility (after giving effect to $6.0 million of outstanding letters of credit). In addition, to the extent new debt is added to us and our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described above would increase.\nConcentra's inability to meet the conditions and payments under the Concentra credit facilities, although non-recourse to Select, could jeopardize Select's equity contribution to Group Holdings.\nSelect is not a party to the Concentra credit facilities and is not an obligor with respect to Concentra's debt under such agreements; however, if Concentra fails to meet its obligations and defaults on the Concentra credit facilities, a portion of or all of Select's equity investment in Group Holdings, the indirect parent company of Concentra, could be at risk of loss.", "PERMNO": 88972, "SIC": 8051, "TIC": "SEM.4"}
