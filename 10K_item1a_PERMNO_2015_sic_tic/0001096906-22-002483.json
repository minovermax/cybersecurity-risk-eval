RISK FACTORS\nThe Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties involving precious metal prices, explorations costs and government oversight. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before purchasing the Company\u2019s common shares. The occurrence of any of the following events could negatively affect our business operations and our results of operations. If these events occur, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common shares could decline, and shareholders may lose part or even all of their investment.\nRisk Associated with Our Business\nOur business involves a number of very significant risks, including but not limited to various areas of the mining exploration industry. The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties involving precious metal prices, explorations costs and government oversight. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed as a result of the occurrence of any of the following risks.\nYou should invest in our common stock only if you can afford to lose your entire investment. Your decision to invest in our common stock should only be made after you have knowingly accepted the possibilities of such a loss and the associated risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAll of our properties are in the exploration stage. There can be no assurance that we will establish the existence of any mineral resource or reserves on any of our properties. Until we can do so, there is a possibility we may not be likely to generate substantial revenues from these properties on an economically feasible basis, and our business could fail.\nWe have not established that any of our mining properties contain any mineral reserves; and as such, under Regulation S-K 1300 et. seq. (\u201cReg S-K 1300\u201d), we are considered an \u201cexploration stage company.\u201d Under the new rules set forth in Reg S-K 1300, an individual property is defined as being: 1.) An exploration stage property if it has no mineral reserves disclosed; 2.) A development stage property if it has mineral reserves disclosed, but has no material extraction; and 3.) A production stage property if it has material extraction of mineral reserves. Our ability to conclude that an individual prospect has any viable mineral reserves requires further efforts and any funds that we spend on exploration may be lost. Even if we do eventually discover mineral reserves on one or more of our properties and they are considered \u201cdevelopment stage\u201d because we have not engaged in any material extraction, there can be no assurances that they will become production stage properties. Both mineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk and few properties, which are explored become development properties; and even if they become eligible to be considered development stage properties, as defined in Reg. S-K 1300, there are no assurances that they will ultimately become production stage properties with commercially viable producing mines.\nThe commercial viability of an established mineral deposit will depend on a large number of factors; including, by way of example, the size, grade and other attributes of the mineral deposit, the proximity of the resource to infrastructure, roads and a point for shipping, government regulation and market prices. Most of these factors will be beyond our control, and any of them could increase costs and make extraction of any previously identified mineral resource unprofitable. Because of this, we will most likely be required to conduct a \u201cfeasibility study\u201d by a qualified person or company in order to secure any financing for development, extraction and processing. Feasibility studies, themselves, are very time consuming and costly. There are no assurances that we will be able to fund a feasibility study or to find an investor or partner that will be willing to fund feasibility studies needed to progress to extraction. If we are unable to fund a feasibility study when needed, or if the results of a feasibility study do not suggest that a property will be commercially viable, any funds used on the property will have been lost.\nEven if commercial viability of a mineral or metal deposit is established, we may be required to expend significant resources until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to both establish proven and probable reserves as well as those required to implement permitting and drilling operations. Because of these uncertainties, investors have no assurances that our drilling programs will result in commercially viable operations nor that we will be successful in the establishment or expansion of any resources or reserves. Any failure in our ability to successfully execute on the forgoing will adversely impact our business results of operations, in turn leading to losses for investors.\nAs the Company has adopted the required disclosure prescribed in Regulation S-K 1300 et. seq., the concept of a feasibility study is the same; and although, the terms \u201cmineral resource\u201d, \u201cmeasured mineral resource\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resource\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resource\u201d were not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and were not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Under Reg. S-K 1300 each of those terms is specifically defined and must be used as defined therein in describing mineral deposits in the required reports. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of potential mineral deposits will ever be converted into \u201cmineral resources,\u201d as the term under Reg. S-K 1300 means not only that there are mineral deposits present but that they have been determined to be economically viable for extraction. The mineral deposits on our properties have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic feasibility. Our properties currently do not contain any known proven or probable ore reserves under Reg. S-K 1300 reporting standards. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any identified mineral deposits will be determined to be mineral reserves or ever be converted into mineral resources as defined in Reg. S-K 1300 et. seq.\nIf we establish the existence of commercially viable mineral resources on any of our properties, we will require additional capital in order to develop the property into a producing mine. If we cannot raise this additional capital, we will not be able to exploit the resource, and our business could suffer.\nIf we do discover mineral resources on any of our properties, as defined under Reg. S-K 1300 meaning that such mineral deposit(s) is/are commercially viable, we will be required to expend substantial sums of money to establish the extent of the resource, engage in drilling operations and develop extraction and processing facilities (or effect acceptable shipping arrangements therefor) and infrastructure. We do not have adequate capital to develop necessary facilities and infrastructure and will need to raise additional funds. Although we may derive substantial benefits from the discovery of commercially exploitable deposits, there can be no assurance that such a mineral resource will be large enough to justify conventional commercial operations or that we will be able to raise the funds required for development and/or processing on a timely basis. If we cannot raise the necessary capital or complete the necessary facilities, infrastructure, development, processing or related activities, our business may fail and we may be forced to curtail or cease operations.\nOur exploration and extraction activities may not be commercially successful.\nWhile we believe there are positive indicators that our properties contain commercially exploitable minerals and metals, such belief has been based solely on preliminary tests that we have conducted and data provided by third parties. There can be no assurance that the tests and data upon which we have relied are correct or accurate. Moreover, mineral exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and is frequently non-productive. Unusual or unexpected geologic formations and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor are risks involved in the conduct of most exploration programs. The success of mineral exploration and development is determined in part by the following factors:\n\u00b7the identification of potential mineralization based on analysis;\n\u00b7the availability of permits;\n\u00b7compliance with environmental requirements;\n\u00b7increases in operating mining related costs;\n\u00b7the quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise; and\n\u00b7the capital available for mining operations.\nSubstantial expenditures and time are required to establish existing proven and probable reserves through drilling and analysis, and to develop the mines and facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining. Whether a mineral or metal deposit will be commercially viable and meet Reg. S-K 1300\u2019s definition of \u201cmineral resource\u201d, depends on a number of factors, which include, without limitation: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; metal prices, which fluctuate widely; and government regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection; and general economic factors, which include, without limitation, market prices for certain minerals or metals, labor costs, the impact of technological innovations on the supply and demand for the commodities we mine. If our exploration and extraction activities are not successful, our business will likely fail.\nThere may be challenges to the title of our mineral properties.\nThe Company has acquired certain rights to its properties by unpatented claims, ownership of land or by lease from those owning the property and its patented claims are limited. The validity of title to many types of natural resource property depends upon numerous circumstances and factual matters (many of which are not discoverable of record or by other readily available means) and is subject to many uncertainties of existing law and its application. There can be no assurance that the validity of our titles to our properties will be upheld or that third parties will not otherwise seek to invalidate those rights. In the event the validity of our title to any of these properties are not upheld, such events would have a material adverse effect on us.\nMineral operations are subject to applicable law and government regulations. Even if we discover a mineral resource in a commercially exploitable quantity, these laws and regulations could restrict or prohibit the exploitation of them. If we cannot exploit any mineral resources that we discover on our properties, our business may fail.\nBoth mineral exploration and extraction require permits from various foreign, federal, state, provincial and local governmental authorities and are governed by laws and regulations, including those with respect to prospecting, mine development, mineral production, transport, export, taxation, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety and other matters.\nCompanies, such as ours that plan to engage in exploration and extraction activities, often experience increased costs and delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. Issuance of permits for our activities is subject to the discretion of government authorities, and we may be unable to obtain or maintain such permits. Permits required for future exploration or development may not be obtainable on reasonable terms, on a timely basis or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any of the permits required for the continued exploration or development of our mineral properties or for the construction and operation of a mine on our properties at economically viable costs. If we cannot accomplish these objectives, our business could face difficulty and/or fail.\nWe believe that we are in compliance with all material laws and regulations that currently apply to our activities but there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. Current laws and regulations could be amended and we might not be able to comply with them, as amended. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain all permits necessary for our future operations, or that we will be able to obtain them on reasonable terms. To the extent such approvals are required and are not obtained, we may be delayed or prohibited from proceeding with planned exploration or development of our mineral properties.\nEnvironmental hazards unknown to us, which have been caused by previous or existing owners or operators of the properties, may exist on the properties in which we hold an interest. It is possible that our properties could be located on or near the site of a Federal Superfund cleanup project. Although we endeavor to avoid such sites, it is possible that environmental cleanup or other environmental restoration procedures could remain to be completed or mandated by law, causing unpredictable and unexpected liabilities to arise. We are not currently aware of any environmental issues or litigation relating to any of our current or former properties but if they were to arise, we could face significant liability that would negatively impact our operations that would cause our business to fail.\nCompetition in the mining industry is intense, and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete.\nCompetition in the mining industry for desirable properties, investment capital, equipment and personnel are intense. Numerous companies headquartered in the United States, Canada and elsewhere throughout the world compete for properties on a global basis, including areas where we intend to operate. We are currently an insignificant participant in the mining industry due, in part, to our limited financial and personnel resources. We may be unable to: i) attract the necessary investment capital or a joint venture partner to fully develop our mineral properties, ii) acquire other desirable properties, iii) attract and hire necessary personnel, or iv) purchase necessary equipment.\nThe nature of mineral exploration and production activities involves a high degree of risk and the possibility of uninsured losses.\nThe business of exploring for and extracting minerals and metals involves a high degree of risk. Few properties are ultimately developed into producing mines. Whether a mineral deposit can be commercially viable depends upon a number of factors, including the particular attributes of the deposit, including size, grade and proximity to infrastructure, metal prices, which can be highly variable, and government regulation, including environmental and reclamation obligations. These factors are not within our control. Uncertainties as to the metallurgical amenability of any minerals discovered may not warrant the mining of these metals or minerals on the basis of available technology. Our operations are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and developing mineral or metal properties, such as, but not limited to:\n\u00b7encountering unusual or unexpected formations;\n\u00b7environmental pollution;\n\u00b7personal injury, flooding and landslides;\n\u00b7variations in grades of minerals or metals;\n\u00b7political and economic related conditions;\n\u00b7labor disputes; and\n\u00b7a decline in the price of gold or silver.\nWe currently have no insurance or hedges to guard against any of these risks. If we determine that capitalized costs associated with any of our mineral interests are not likely to be recovered, we would incur a write-down on our investment in such property interests. All of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent which are not recoverable. The payment of any liabilities that arise from any such occurrence would have a material, adverse impact on our Company.\nOur exploration and development activities are subject to environmental risks, which could expose us to significant liability and delay, suspension or termination of our operations.\nThe exploration, possible future development and production phases of our business will be subject to federal, state and local environmental regulation. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set out limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Future changes in environmental regulations, if any, may adversely affect our operations. If we fail to comply with any of the applicable environmental laws, regulations or permit requirements, we could face regulatory or judicial sanctions. Penalties imposed by either the courts or administrative bodies could delay or stop our operations or require a considerable capital expenditure. Although we intend to comply with all environmental laws and permitting obligations in conducting our business, there is always a possibility that those opposed to exploration and mining may attempt to interfere with our operations, whether by legal process, regulatory process or otherwise.\nWe could be subject to environmental lawsuits.\nNeighboring landowners, other third parties and governmental entities could file claims based on environmental statutes and common law for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste material into the environment on or around our properties. There can be no assurance that our defense of such claims will be successful. A successful claim against us could have an adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Company\u2019s industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors which may give them an advantage in developing and securing mining claims and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete.\nWe are involved in a highly competitive industry where we may compete with numerous other companies who offer alternative methods or approaches. These competitors may have far greater resources, more experience, and personnel perhaps more qualified than we do.\nSuch resources may give our competitors an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or products that make our products obsolete. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these other entities.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to continue to attract, train, or retain highly qualified personnel could harm the Company\u2019s business:\nThe Company\u2019s success also depends on the Company\u2019s ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel, specifically those with management and product development skills. In particular, the Company must hire additional skilled personnel to further the Company\u2019s research and development efforts. Competition for such personnel is intense. If the Company does not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating the Company\u2019s current personnel, the Company\u2019s business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to the Company\nLitigation with respect to Mr. Laws may not result in additional funds being obtained to reduce his indebtedness owed to the Company.\nThe Company has determined by its records that Mr. Laws initially owed us $1,197,198 (\u201cThe Missing Funds\u201d), excluding related professional fees, forensic accounting costs and interest and penalties associated with the indebtedness. As of the filing of this Form 10-K, after deducting cash collections of $990,632 from Laws and related litigation and properties held for sale of $25,800, Laws owes the Company $180,766 plus penalties, professional fees and accrued interest. The Company has been awarded from litigation and collection efforts, the foreclosure on pledged assets and received these assets free and clear of any liens.\nThere were also expenses associated with engaging the special committee to conduct a forensic review of the Company\u2019s books and records in connection with the transactions giving rise to the Missing Funds. The Company has incurred costs associated with engaging counsel to represent the Company in this matter and in the investigations as well as the court proceedings. The Missing Funds together with the additional expenses that have arisen as a result of Mr. Laws\u2019 actions in the aggregate are substantial and have been expensed in the periods incurred.\nThere can be no assurance the Company will successfully implement its plans.\nWe have historically incurred net losses from operations and we expect losses in the future periods. Our likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the formation of a new business which seeks to obtain funds to finance its operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that we will successfully implement any of our plans (including without limitation production of any mine, shipping ore to a smelter or otherwise commercially exploit our properties) in a timely or effective manner or that we will ever be profitable. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will choose to continue to develop any of our current properties because we intend to consider and, as appropriate, to divest ourselves of properties that may no longer be a strategic fit to our business strategy or that we lack the necessary capital to develop. If we lack the capital to implement our plans, we will be forced to curtail or cease operations.\nMineral exploration and development inherently involve significant and irreducible financial risks. We may suffer from the failure to find and develop profitable mineral deposits.\nThe exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves significant financial risks, which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. Unprofitable efforts may result from the failure to discover mineral deposits. Even if mineral deposits are found, such deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Mining companies rely on consultants and others for exploration, development, construction and operating expertise.\nSubstantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. The economic feasibility of any development project is based upon, among other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates and capital and operating costs of such development projects, and metals prices. Development projects are also subject to the completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate financing.\nOnce a mineral deposit is developed, whether it will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection; and mineral prices. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nSignificant investment risks and operational costs are associated with our exploration activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect our business.\nMineral exploration, particularly for gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. If mineralization is discovered, it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Development projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Development project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual cash operating costs and economic returns of any and all development projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nAny of our future acquisitions may result in significant risks, which may adversely affect our business.\nAn important element of our business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of operating mines, properties and businesses or interests therein within our geographical area of interest. While it is our practice to engage independent mining consultants to assist in evaluating and making acquisitions, any mining properties or interests therein we may acquire may not be developed profitably or, if profitable when acquired, that profitability might not be sustained. In connection with any future acquisitions, we may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing shareholders. We cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of our business or our common stock. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions, may impact the price of our common stock and negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to find and acquire new mineral properties is uncertain. Accordingly, our prospects are uncertain for the future growth of our business.\nBecause mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, we may seek to replace and expand our future ore reserves, if any. Identifying promising mining properties is difficult and speculative. Furthermore, we encounter strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing gold. Many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do. Consequently, we may be unable to replace and expand future ore reserves through the acquisition of new mining properties or interests therein on terms we consider acceptable. As a result, our future revenues from the sale of gold or other precious metals, if any, may decline, resulting in lower income and reduced growth.\nDelaware law and our by-laws protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits.\nDelaware law provides that our directors will not be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages except for certain types of conduct as directors. Our by-laws require us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require us to use our assets to defend our directors and officers against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.\nEven if the Ore Contains a Substantial amount of Gold or Silver it May Not be Profitable Because of Other Factors.\nThe Company is in the preliminary stages of mining operations in the Jim Crow and Billali Mines. There can be no assurances of continued mining operations at the Jim Crow and Billali Mines or that continued operations will be profitable. The Company currently does not have a long-term smelting contract and there can be no assurances that shipping to a smelter will occur in the immediate or near future. Transportation of head ore is expensive and the smelter the Company previously used is no longer accepting ore from outside sources. This has forced the Company to advance its plans to construct a mill on our site in Duncan, Arizona. This will enable us to process our ore into concentrate, which is more efficient to transport cost wise to the smelter. Without the ability to process the head ore into concentrate, the transportation of the head ore is cost prohibitive. Thus, it is imperative that the Company construct a mill to process its ore on a site that is in close proximity to our mine sites. Any delays in securing the financing necessary to construct the required mill and/or any delays in constructing it will negatively impact the Company\u2019s mining operations and results of operations. The Company is currently seeking financing to construct the mill but there can be no assurances that it will be successful in securing the necessary financing or that if it is able to secure financing that it will be on terms that are favorable to the Company. Any delays or problems in raising the funds required for a mill will adversely impact the Company and its operations which ultimately adversely impacts investors.\nDismissal of Bankruptcy Proceedings and Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization did not result in the elimination of Company liabilities.\nAfter the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition in June 2016 and the sale of the Company\u2019s significant assets, the Company emerged with limited assets while it remained liable for all commitments and debts that then were outstanding. Santa Fe Gold Barbados, The Lordsburg Mining Company and AZCO are subsidiaries of the Company with no assets and all of their commitments and debts remain outstanding. The bankruptcy court set up a trust fund, funded by the activities of the Summit mine (main asset sold in bankruptcy proceedings) for five years from the inception of mine production at the Summit mine and the trust funds will be distributed to certain unsecured creditors by an independent trustee. The Company failed to provide a plan of reorganization with the filing for protection under the Bankruptcy Code and as such, its debts were not discharged. The significant transactions that occurred upon emergence from bankruptcy were as follows:\n\u00b7The approximately $20 million of indebtedness outstanding on account of the Company\u2019s senior notes and unsecured claims were reinstated; and\n\u00b7The courts established a trust in April 2016 for the benefit of certain creditors. A profit interest was attached to the Summit mine with the benefit for certain creditors holding unsecured claims filed by each creditor.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s remaining liabilities, after the emergence from bankruptcy, will not materially impact the Company. The Company has no continuing commitment from any party to provide working capital, and there is no certainty that the Company will be able to raise sufficient capital to fund any or all existing liabilities as well as to fund its current business plan. The failure to raise needed capital may result in the curtailment or cessation of our business.\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect to incur substantial operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have had no revenues since emerging from bankruptcy, and we may not generate revenues this current fiscal year, depending on the completion of our mill project. We do not currently have sufficient capital to fund operations through June 30, 2023 and will need to raise additional funding to implement our business strategy. Even if we succeed in developing any of our properties and the mill site, we may incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future. As the Company has no commitment for debt or equity financing, the Company will be reliant upon best-efforts fund-raising activities to provide sufficient working capital to fund current and future needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its best-efforts capital raising efforts, and the failure to raise needed capital will result in the curtailment or cessation of our business.\nWe may never be able to write-down certain liabilities and this may have a negative impact on our ability to raise capital and on the market price of our common stock, when we resume trading.\nAt the end of the Company\u2019s fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, the Company wrote off debt and related accrued interest aggregating $12,507,540. The write off of debt was related to two finance facilities governed by and enforceable under British Columbia statutes. The Company retained legal services in British Columbia to research the British Columbia statutes of limitations on the collectability of the finance facilities. Legal counsel reviewed all related documents, records of proceedings and all records and documents deemed relevant to the two finance facilities. The finance facilities were subject to the laws of the Providence of British Columbia and the National laws of Canada and as a result, the Company secured a written legal opinion from Canadian counsel that any liability under the two finance facilities, because of the Limitations Act (British Columbia) and the relevant case law in British Columbia, were no longer enforceable. That is, because the statute of limitations had run for the two liabilities, pursuant to the Limitations Act (British Columbia), no future claims could be commenced in the Province of British Columbia and therefore, the Company had no outstanding legal obligations on the two finance facilities. With this, the Company wrote down $12,507,540 in liabilities and this has been the Company\u2019s position; however, upon review of earlier Registration Statements that were subsequently withdrawn, the SEC Staff expressed its concern with the Company taking this write-down because FASB ASC 405-20-40-1(b) states that \u201ca liability has been extinguished if the debtor is legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability, either judicially or by the creditor.\u201d Since management knew that one of the creditors had been dissolved and was no longer in existence and the other creditor had written-off the amounts that had been owed to it by the Company in one of its annual reports, it knew that it would be difficult if not impossible to get both creditors to release it from liability and that obtaining a court order would be time consuming and expensive at best. The Commission Staff was willing to allow an opinion of counsel, however the opinions we provided did not meet the standard that the Commission requires. The standard that the Commission Staff requires is what is sometimes referred to as a \u201cwould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d opinion. In requiring a \u201cwill\u201d or \u201cwould\u201d opinion, the Commission is looking for greater assurance that the Company \u201cwould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d be successful in the event that one of the creditors sought to collect on the liabilities. Although this standard may seem subjective, \u201cwill opinions\u201d are regularly used in the context of tax law where a tax opinion is needed. In that context the term \u201cwill\u201d means that the drafter of the opinion believes and is effectively stating that there is a 90%-95% probability that a given result \u201cwill\u201d come to pass based on the facts present. Absent the availability of one of these three routes to write-off the liabilities, he Commission Staff\u2019s position is that\nthe correct treatment of the aforementioned liabilities is to continue carrying them on the Company\u2019s balance sheets. The Company was not able to procure a judicial order in a timely manner, specific written agreement of the creditors nor an opinion of counsel meeting the \u201cwould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d standard, therefore it determined the most expeditious course of action was to restate the consolidated financial statements so that the liabilities that were written-off are now included in the liabilities of the Company once again; in effect, restating the consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2019 and 2020. Although, in a future period, while the Company plans to either seek a judicial determination or an opinion of counsel that meets the \u201cwould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d standard with respect to the liabilities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in meeting the requirements necessary to write-off the aforementioned liabilities or that the Commission will agree that the judicial determination or opinion of counsel satisfies the requirements and spirit of FASB ASC 405-20-40-1(b). To meet the requirements of the Commission, the Company reinstated the debt and restated our financial statements in question in our Registration Statement on Form 10-12G filed on June 14, 2022 and became effective on August 4, 2022. As a result of these restated financial statements and the forward impact on future financial statements, our stock prices as well as our ability to secure necessary financial funding could be harmed as a result.\nWe have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and properties.\nAny investment in the Company\u2019s securities should be considered a high-risk investment because investors will be placing funds at risk in an early-stage business with unforeseen costs, expenses, competition, a history of operating losses and other problems, to which start-up ventures are often subject. Investors should not invest in the Company\u2019s securities unless they can afford to lose their entire investment. Your investment must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties encountered in establishing a new business in a highly competitive and mature industry. Our operating history does not provide a meaningful basis for an evaluation of our current prospects. Other than through conventional and typical exploration methods and procedures, we have no additional way to evaluate the likelihood of whether other properties contain commercial quantities of mineral or metal reserves or, if they do, if they will be operated successfully.\nManagement of growth may be necessary for us to be competitive.\nSuccessful expansion of our business will depend on our ability to effectively attract and manage staff, strategic business relationships, and shareholders. Specifically, we will need to hire skilled management and technical personnel as well as manage partnerships and joint ventures to navigate shifts in the general economic environment. Expansion has the potential to place significant strains on financial, management, and operational resources, yet failure to expand will inhibit our profitability goals.\nIf we cannot secure additional funding, we will be unable to implement our business plan.\nSince we do not generate any revenues, we may not have sufficient financial resources ourselves, to undertake all planned development activities relating to our business plan. As stated, the smelter the Company previously used is no longer accepting ore from outside sources and this has forced the Company to advance its plans to construct a mill on site so that the ore can be processed into concentrate. Without the ability to process the head ore into concentrate, the transportation of the head ore is cost prohibitive. Thus, unless the smelter we had used previously begins accepting outside ore for processing, it is imperative that the Company construct a mill to process its ore. The Company had planned on constructing a mill in the future but this development with our previous smelter has forced the Company to plan and start construction immediately in order for it to realize any revenue from the ore it mines. The Company currently does not have the financial resources to construct the mill, therefore until it is able to secure the necessary financing, its prospects for generating revenue from the Jim Crow and Billali Mines is non-existent. Nevertheless, there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available to us or that if available, that it would be on terms acceptable to us. We do not have any commitments for debt or equity financing at this time, nor do we have credit facilities available with financial institutions or other third parties, and investors may lose their all of their investment if we are unable to secure such financing in a timely manner. As the Company has no commitment for debt or equity financing, the Company will be reliant upon its own best-efforts fund-raising activities to provide sufficient working capital to fund its current and future needs, as well as on the potential cash flow from operations. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in its best-efforts capital raising or receive significant cash flow from operations; and the failure to generate needed working capital may result in the curtailment or cessation of its business, and losses for investors.\nOur resources may not be sufficient to manage our expected growth; failure to properly manage our potential growth would be detrimental to our business.\nEven if we obtain funding for operations, we may fail to adequately manage our anticipated future growth. Any growth in our operations will place a significant strain on our administrative, financial and operational resources, and increase demands on our management, as well as our operational and administrative systems, controls and other resources. There can be no assurances that our existing personnel, systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations in the future; or that we will be able to successfully implement appropriate measures consistent with our growth strategy. As part of this growth, we may have to implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base, and maintain close coordination among our staff. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to do so, or that if we are able to do so, we will be able to effectively integrate them into our existing staff and systems.\nIf we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. As with all expanding businesses, the potential exists that growth will occur rapidly. If we are unable to effectively manage this growth, our business and operating results could suffer. Anticipated growth in future operations may place a significant strain on management systems and resources. In addition, the integration of new personnel will continue to result in some disruption to ongoing operations. The ability to effectively manage growth in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning and management processes. We will need to continue to improve operational, financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, and will need to continue to expand, train and manage our work force.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely impact the Company.\nThe nature of our business, including our ability to continue our current activities depends, in large part, on the efforts of our key personnel, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of our financial condition, our auditors have expressed doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern which may have an adverse impact on our relationship with third parties with whom we do business, and could make it challenging and difficult for us to raise additional debt or equity financing, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, it may be unable to realize the carrying value of its assets and to meet its liabilities as they become due.\nA substantial or extended decline in gold and silver prices would have a material adverse effect on the value of our assets, on our ability to raise capital and could result in lower than estimated economic returns.\nThe value of our assets, our ability to raise capital and any future economic returns are substantially dependent on the prices of gold and silver. Gold and silver prices fluctuate daily and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence gold prices, for example, include:\n\u00b7gold sales or leasing by governments and central banks or changes in their monetary policy, including gold inventory management and reallocation of reserves;\n\u00b7speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold;\n\u00b7the relative strength of the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7expectations of the future rate of inflation;\n\u00b7interest rates;\n\u00b7changes to economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries;\n\u00b7geopolitical conflicts;\n\u00b7changes in industrial, jewelry or investment demand;\n\u00b7changes in supply from production, disinvestment and scrap; and\n\u00b7forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s Common Stock was Deregistered and Trading was Halted.\nIn July of 2020, the Company received notice from the SEC that it was seeking to deregister the Company\u2019s common stock pursuant to Section 12(j), based on the Company\u2019s failure to file periodic reports with the Commission and otherwise provide current information to the market. This failure was based in large part from the need to restate its financial statements and the need to find and engage a PCAOB auditor who was willing to conduct and provide the required audits amid the SEC and DOJ\u2019s investigations. Although we were able to secure a qualified auditor, we were not able to make our filings quickly enough and by the time they were completed, the Commission had already sent a notice under Section 12(k). The Commission takes a hardline position in these situations such that once they have instituted deregistration proceedings, the only options available to the Company were to litigate or settle and consent to the deregistration of the Company\u2019s common stock. Historically, registrants have not been successful in litigating with the Commission over Section 12(j) matters and therefore the Company determined that the best course of action was to consent to deregistration of its common stock and then file a new registration statement on Form 10-12G. The Company has signed a settlement agreement with the SEC with respect to the registration of its common stock in response to the Commission\u2019s institution of deregistration proceedings under Section 12(j), and has re-registered the same under Section 12(g) by way of filing our Form 10-12G and the filing has been ordered effective by the SEC on August 4, 2022. Currently the Company is preparing the application to the Over-the-Counter Markets Group (\u201cthe OTC\u201d) to trade on their QB tier. Upon the OTC completing their due diligence on the application their and approval of the\napplication, it will submit a Form 211 to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) for their final review and acceptance of the OTC due diligence process. The Company filed a complete and current Form 10-12G and it meets the informational requirements of the SEC Rule 15c2-11. Upon the FINRA approval, they will issue our trading symbol and the Company will begin trading. Any delay or failure in securing FINRA\u2019s final approval and issuance of our trading symbol would result in our shareholders not having a public market to sell their shares. Further, it would make it more difficult for the Company to obtain the financing it requires.\nOur common stock is not currently traded, and there is no guarantee that our stock will be tradable or that if it is as to the prices at which the shares may trade.\nTrading of our common stock recently was most recently quoted by OTC Markets Group, Inc., under the ticker symbol \u201cSFEG.\u201d Since the Company was not current in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d), the Company it had a \u201cskull and cross bones\u201d associated with its trading symbol (the symbol used by OTC Markets meaning \u201cCaveat Emptor\u201d or buyer beware) but trading was suspended indefinitely when the SEC approved the Company\u2019s settlement agreement which culminated in the deregistration of its common stock following the proceedings instituted by the Commission under Section 12j. In July 2020 we received notice that on June 25, 2020, the Commission had issued an order suspending trading under Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act.\u201d). Thereafter, the Commission commenced administrative proceedings to de-register the Company\u2019s common stock under Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act. On December 17, 2020, the SEC order suspending trading went into effect.\nCurrently the Company is preparing the application to the OTC to trade on their QB tier. Upon the OTC completing their due diligence on the application and their approval of the application, it will submit a Form 211 to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) for their final review and acceptance of the OTC due diligence process. The Company filed a complete and current Form 10-12G and it meets the informational requirements of the SEC Rule 15c-211. Upon the FINRA approval, they will issue our trading symbol and the Company will begin trading. Any delay or failure in securing FINRA\u2019s final approval and issuance of our trading symbol would result in our shareholders not having a public market to sell their shares. This in turn would negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to secure the funding required for it to execute on its business plan, which would negatively affect its operations and could result in a complete loss to investors.\nAlthough our Form 10-12G became effective, with all comments cleared, we still face challenges in receiving FINRA approval and even if we are successful and resume trading, trading may still be limited or suffer because we are not listed on an established securities exchange.\nAlthough management is optimistic that we will receive approval to resume trading and views any delays as a short-term issue as of the date of filing of this Form 10-K, there can be no assurances that we will in fact receive timely approval to resume trading or that we will ever be successful in our efforts to resume trading. Additionally, even if we are able to resume trading through the quotations on OTC Markets, not being listed for trading on an established securities exchange has an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions, number of market makers and lack of security analysts\u2019 research coverage of the Company. This may result in systemically lower prices for your common stock than might otherwise be obtained if the Company had been listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ exchanges and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and ask prices that are quoted for our common stock. Historically, our common stock has been thinly traded, and there is no guarantee of the prices at which the shares will trade, or that there will be sufficient volume to allow stockholders to sell their shares without having an adverse effect on market prices.\nBecause our common stock is currently a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d it may be difficult to sell shares at times and prices that are acceptable.\nAssuming we are successful in having our stock resume trading on OTC Markets, our common stock will likely be considered a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC. This document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the penny stock market. A broker must also give a purchaser, orally or in writing, bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson compensation, make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and obtain the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the purchase. Assuming a market maker are allowed to provide bid and offer quotations because we have been successful in securing through our OTC application process and we are able to satisfy FINRA\u2019s requirements, we will continue to be considered a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d The penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock. Because of these rules, many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions and there is less trading in penny stocks overall as a result. Accordingly, you may not always be able to resell shares of our common stock in ordinary transactions at times and prices that you feel are appropriate.\nIf we are successful, it our efforts to have our stock resume trading, the sale of it by existing stockholders may depress its price due to the limited trading market that would likely exist.\nAny sales of a significant amount of common stock by existing shareholders may depress the price otherwise causing the price of our common stock may decline.\nA small number of existing shareholders own a significant portion of our common stock, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of any shareholder vote.\nA relatively small number of shareholders hold large concentrations of shares and under our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law, the vote of a majority of the shares outstanding is generally required to approve most shareholder actions. As a result, these individuals and entities will be able to influence the outcome of shareholder votes for the foreseeable future, including votes concerning the election of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation or proposed mergers or other significant corporate transactions.\nIf the Company is successful in its efforts to have its common stock resume trading, the Company\u2019s stock price and volume is likely to be highly volatile, limited and sporadic.\nThe market price of our common stock fluctuated historically and if the Company is successful in its efforts to have it resume trading is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be exaggerated since the trading volume would likely be volatile, limited, and sporadic. These fluctuations may or may not be based upon any business or operating results. Our common stock may experience similar or even more dramatic price and volume fluctuations in the future, if our efforts are successful and its trading resumes.\nThe Company will not pay dividends on its common stock.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on any shares of our capital stock, and we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Our current business plan is to retain any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant at that time. If we do not pay cash dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. This may never happen and investors may lose all of their investment in our company.\nIf trading in our common stock is allowed to resume, any outstanding shares that are eligible for future sale could adversely impact a public trading market for our common stock.\nWe have offered and sold and will continue to offer and sell shares without registration under the Securities Act, through exemptions available under the Securities Act. All such shares are \"restricted securities\" as defined by Rule 144 (\"Rule 144\") when issued under available exemptions from registration under the Securities Act, and cannot be resold without registration except in reliance on Rule 144 or another applicable exemption from registration. In general, under Rule 144, our non-affiliates (who have not been affiliates within the past 90 days) can sell restricted shares held for at least six months, subject only to the requirement that we make current information available publicly as required by Rule 144. However, since being deregistered, some broker-dealers may require a one year holding period out of an abundance of caution if they take the position that the Company could have been a shell at some point. Shareholders including our affiliates could sell restricted securities after they have been held for six months if broker-dealers are willing to accept that the Company has never been a shell, subject to compliance with manner of sale, volume restrictions, Form 144 filing and current public information requirements.\nNo prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of restricted shares of common stock, or the availability of such common stock for sale, would have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time, assuming the resumption of trading. Sales of substantial amounts of such common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the then prevailing market price of the common stock.\nRisk Factors Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nAn occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These factors, in turn, may not only impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our product but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Our mine manager and two employee miners contracted COVID-19 and our operations were negatively affected in the form of delays in the execution of our business plan. Although, it appears that the Company will not continue to experience issues due to COVID-19, assuming that the vaccines on the market prove successful, of which there can be no assurance. It is possible that new variants of the COVID virus may develop and that they may have the same or worse impact on our future operations and in our markets as was experienced with COVID-19.\nBecause we may issue additional shares of our common stock, investment in our company could be subject to substantial dilution.\nInvestors\u2019 interests in our Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share when we issue additional shares. We are authorized to issue 550,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.002 par value per share. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021 there were 441,308,551 and 433,018,551, shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, respectively. We anticipate that all or at least some of our future funding, if any, will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. If we do sell more common stock, investors\u2019 investment in our company will likely be diluted. Dilution is the difference between what investors pay for their stock and the net tangible book value per share immediately after the additional shares are sold by us. If dilution occurs, any investment in our Company\u2019s common stock could seriously decline in value.\nOur prior trading in our common stock on the OTC Pink Exchange has been subject to wide fluctuations.\nOur common stock was quoted for public trading on OTC Markets prior to Commission order suspending trading that went into effect on December 17, 2020. Historically, the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations. Assuming trading resumes, of which there can be no assurance, the trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of factors, many of which will be beyond our control. The stock market has generally experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies with limited business operations. There can be no assurance that trading prices and price earnings ratios previously experienced by our common stock will be matched or maintained. These broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs for us and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nDelaware law our Certificate of Incorporation and our by-laws provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors at our expense, and correspondingly limits their liability, which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our shareholders because corporate resources may be expended for the benefit of officers and/or directors.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws include provisions that eliminate the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent possible under the laws of the State of Delaware or other applicable law. These provisions eliminate the liability of our directors and our shareholders for monetary damages arising out of any violation of a director of his fiduciary duty of due care. Under Delaware law, however, such provisions do not eliminate the personal liability of a director for (i) breach of the director's duty of loyalty, (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, (iii) payment of dividends or repurchases of stock other than from lawfully available funds, or (iv) any transaction from which the director derived an improper benefit. These provisions do not affect a director's liabilities under the federal securities laws or the recovery of damages by third parties.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (known as \u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nTrading was suspended on our common stock following the deregistration of our common stock in accordance with our settlement with the SEC.\nTrading in our common stock was suspended after the SEC commenced Administrative Proceedings under 12k of the Exchange Act. The Commission then commenced proceedings under 12j of the Exchange Act to deregister our common stock because we had not posted current information by filing the required Periodic Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We had not made these filings because of the need to restate our financial statements following the misappropriation of funds by our former CEO, Thomas Laws. However, notwithstanding these mitigating circumstances, the failure to file the required reports is a matter of strict liability and has resulted in the deregistration of our common stock, which became effective on December 17, 2020 following execution of our settlement agreement with the Commission. We may not be able unable to satisfy FINRA\u2019s requirements in a timely manner or at all, market makers will not post bids or offers for our common stock.\nOn September 28, 2021, the SEC compliance date of their amended Rule 15c2-11and the amended FINRA rule 6432 went into effect. The amended Rule 15c2-11 allows a qualified IDOS (i.e., the OTC Markets) to comply with the information review requirements, to\npublish an affirmative determination that it has conducted such review, and for the broker-dealer to rely on the OTC markets determination without conducting an independent review. As long as the OTC Markets makes it known to the public that it has completed a review, a broker-dealer can quote or resume quoting the securities and be in compliance with Rule 15c2-11. The amended Rule 6432 requires that (i) a qualified inter-dealer quotation system (Qualified IDOS) (i.e. OTC Markets) submit a modified Form 211 filing to FINRA in connection with each initial information review that it conducts; (ii) a Qualified IDOS ( OTC Markets) that makes a certain publicly available determination under Rule 15c2-11 submit a daily security file to FINRA containing applicable summary information for all securities quoted on its system, and (iii) other changes to the FINRA Rule 6432 and the form 211 to further clarify the operation of the rule and conform it to the amended Rule 15c2-11.\nThe Company has registered its common stock with the SEC on Form 10-12G and the filing has been declared effective by the SEC on August 4, 2022, resulting in the Company becoming an Exchange Act reporting company at that time. The information contained in its Form 10-12G filing was complete and current information, and as a result, the effective filing contains the current information that meets the requirements of Rule 15c2-11.\nUntil we are able to have our Form 211 approved by FINRA and a trading symbol issued by FINRA, of which there can be no assurance, it may be difficult for the Company to secure the financing it requires to implement its current business plan.\nThe filing of our Registration Statement on Form 10-12G should allow us to receive FINRA approval more quickly than we would have if we had not been an Exchange Act reporting company, there is no way to determine the length of time it may take to receive final approval or if we will receive approval at all. Any delays in our ability to secure approval for the filing of our Form 211 t by FINRA and by the OTC will delay market makers from posting bids and offers for our common stock and this in turn, may make it more difficult for the Company to find investors and the capital required for it to implement its business plan. The lack of an active market or even posted bids and offers severely limits our shareholders and prospective shareholders from availing themselves of an exit in the event that they need or want to sell their shares. As a result, many prospective investors may be reluctant to invest in our common stock unless we are able to have market makers resume posting bids and offers. Until the listing is complete, with FINRA\u2019s approval, the Company may have difficulty in finding investors that are willing to purchase shares. Even if investors are willing to purchase shares, they may not be willing to purchase unless shares are offered at substantially lower prices. Any of the forgoing impediments to our ability to sell shares at what we believe are reasonable prices or at all, would have a negative impact on the Company and its operations.", "PERMNO": 80413, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "SFEG"}
