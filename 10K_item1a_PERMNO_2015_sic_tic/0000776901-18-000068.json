{"cik": "776901", "company": "INDEPENDENT BANK CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nChanges in interest rates and other factors could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s ability to make a profit, like that of most financial institutions, substantially depends upon its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. However, certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in market interest rates. Further, interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind. Additionally, some assets such as adjustable-rate mortgages have features, such as rate caps and floors, which restrict changes in applicable interest rates. The Federal Reserve Bank acted to increase interest rates three times in 2017 and may act to implement additional rate increases in the coming year.\nFactors such as inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, global disorder, instability in domestic and foreign financial markets, political uncertainty, and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, may affect interest rates. Changes in market interest rates also affect the level of voluntary prepayments on loans and the receipt of payments on mortgage-backed securities, which can impact the expected timing of receipt of proceeds. Particularly in a decreasing interest environment, prepayments may result in proceeds having to be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage-backed security being prepaid.\nPotential sovereign debt defaults may severely impact global and domestic economies and may lead to significantly tighter liquidity and impact the availability of credit. Economic growth may slow down and the national or global economy may experience additional downturns, including recessionary periods. Market disruption, including potential disruption resulting from Great Britain's decision to exit the European Union, government and central bank policy actions designed to counteract the effects of recession, changes in investor expectations regarding compensation for market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk and changing economic data could impact both the volatility and magnitude of the directional movements of interest rates. Although the Company pursues an asset/liability management strategy designed to manage its risk arising from changes in interest rates, the Company's strategy may not be fully effective, or may be effective in part, and changes in market interest rates can have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nIf the Company experiences loan losses at a level higher than anticipated in the Company's models, its earnings could materially decrease. The Company\u2019s loan customers may not repay loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of loans may be insufficient to assure repayment or cover losses. If loan customers fail to repay loans according to the terms of the loans, the Company may experience significant credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results and capital ratios. The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers, the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans, and the enforceability of its loan documents. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, the Company, in addition to assessing the collectability of its loan portfolio, relies on experience and evaluation of economic conditions. If the assumptions underlying the determination of its allowance for loan losses prove to be incorrect, the current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio and an adjustment may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in its loan portfolio. A problem with one or more loans could require the Company to significantly increase the level of its allowance for loan losses. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require it to increase its allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease the Company\u2019s net income.\nA significant amount of the Company\u2019s loans are concentrated in the Bank\u2019s geographic footprint and adverse conditions in this geographic footprint could negatively impact its results of operations. Substantially all of the loans the Company originates are secured by properties located in, or are made to businesses which operate in, Massachusetts and, to a lesser extent, Rhode Island. Because of the current concentration of the Company\u2019s loan origination activities in its geographic footprint, in the event of adverse economic conditions impacting the region (including, but not limited to, increased unemployment, downward pressure on the value of residential or commercial real estate, or political or business developments that may affect the ability of property owners and businesses to make payments of principal and interest on the underlying loans in the Bank\u2019s geographic footprint), the Company would likely experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on its loans than if its loan portfolio were more geographically diversified, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market could adversely affect the Company\u2019s asset quality and the profitability of loans secured by real property and increase the number of defaults and the level of losses within the Company\u2019s loan portfolio. The real estate collateral securing our loans provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower. Should real estate values deteriorate during the time the credit is extended, the Company is potentially exposed to greater losses. A downturn in the real estate market in the Company\u2019s primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on loans\nand a reduction in the value of the collateral securing loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and asset quality. Further if the Company is required to liquidate collateral securing a loan to satisfy the related debt during a period of reduced real estate values, the Company may experience higher loan losses than expected and its earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity could be adversely affected. Any declines in real estate prices in the Company\u2019s primary markets may also result in increases in delinquencies and losses in its loan portfolios. Unanticipated decreases in real estate prices coupled with a prolonged economic recovery and elevated levels of unemployment could drive loan losses beyond the level provided for in the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses. If this occurs, the Company\u2019s earnings could be adversely affected.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely impacted by changes in law, regulations, and accounting policies. The Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination. See \u201cRegulation\u201d in Item 1 hereof, Business. Any change in the laws or regulations or failure by the Company to comply with applicable law and regulation, or a change in regulators\u2019 supervisory policies or examination procedures, whether by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, other state or federal regulators, the United States Congress, or the Massachusetts legislature could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Changes in accounting policies, practices and standards, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and other accounting standard setters, could also impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe impact of changes to the Internal Revenue Code or federal, state or local taxes may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results or business. The Company is subject to changes in tax law that could impact the Company's effective tax rate. Tax law changes may or may not be retroactive to previous periods and could negatively affect the current and future financial performance of the Company. The full impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") which was enacted in 2017 will be subject to interpretations and assumptions made by the Company, further guidance or regulations that may be promulgated, and other actions that the Company may take as a result of the Tax Act. Although the Company anticipates a significant decrease in its Federal income tax expense, there is no assurance that the Company will realize the benefits of the Tax Act in the amount that is currently anticipated or at all. The Company's customers are likely to experience varying effects from both the individual and business tax provisions of the Tax Act and those effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on the Company's business and the economy as a whole. Some customers may elect to use their additional cash flow from lower taxes to fund their existing levels of activity, decreasing borrowing needs. In addition, certain limitations on the federal income tax deductibility of business interest expense for certain customers could effectively increase the cost of borrowing and make equity or hybrid funding relatively more attractive, which could have a long-term negative impact on our lending volume.\nChanges to and replacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In July of 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the U.K., stated that it will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rate indices. The FCA has indicated that they will support the LIBOR indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate(s). Other financial services regulators and industry groups, including the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), are evaluating the possible phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate interest rate indices or reference rate(s). Accordingly, uncertainty as to the nature of such changes may adversely affect the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to the Company, or impact overall financial condition or results of operations.\nChange in regulatory capital requirements may have an adverse impact on the Company's future financial results. In 2013, the FDIC, the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board approved new rules that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Company and the Bank. The final rule implemented the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The new rules went into effect on January 1, 2015, although certain portions of the rule, including the capital conservation buffer, are being phased in over a period of several years. The application of more stringent capital requirements, including the phase in of the capital conservation buffer could, among other things, lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, or impact the ability to deploy capital (including, without limitation, to pay dividends or to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock).\nThe Company has strong competition within its market area which may constrain the Company\u2019s ability to grow and achieve profitability. The Company faces significant competition both in attracting deposits and in the origination of loans. See \u201cMarket Area and Competition\u201d in Item 1 hereof, Business. Mergers and acquisitions of financial institutions within the Company\u2019s market area may occur which could add more competitive pressure as the Company would be competing with the resultant larger financial institutions with greater financial resources on a combined basis. Additionally, the Company's market share and income may be adversely affected by its inability to successfully compete against larger and more diverse financial service providers. If the Company is unable to compete effectively, it may lose market share or fail to maintain its market share, and income generated from loans, deposits, and other financial products may decline.\nThe success of the Company is dependent on the Company's ability to attract, hire and retain certain key personnel. The Company\u2019s business is complex and specialized and performance is largely dependent on the knowledge, talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. The Company relies on key personnel to manage and operate its business, including major revenue producing functions, such as loan and deposit generation. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s net income. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s net income. The Company\u2019s continued ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate its existing key employees.\nPart of the Company\u2019s business strategy is growth through acquisitions and the failure to execute effectively on acquisitions could have an impact on its earnings and results of operations. While focusing on organic growth, the Company's strategy also includes, in part, growth through acquisitions. The Company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or complete acquisitions. Further, the success of any acquisition depends on the ability to effectively integrate the acquired business, including integrating operations and achieving synergies and cost efficiencies. Acquisitions can be disruptive as they result in diversion of management's attention from other business activities and can consume significant executive and employee resources as the Company integrates the target's operations and functional business into its operations and business. The Company may experience complications or delays while integrating. In addition, once integrated, acquired businesses may not achieve levels of expected profitability or profitability comparable to those achieved by the Company\u2019s existing operations, or otherwise may not perform as expected. Further acquisitions involve numerous risks, including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs, potential dilution of stockholder value, changes in relationships with customers, and the potential loss of key employees. In addition, the Company may not be successful in mitigating deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions. Competition for acquisitions can be highly competitive, and the Company may not be able to acquire other institutions on acceptable terms. The ability to grow may be limited if the Company is unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s securities portfolio performance in difficult market conditions could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s results of operations. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company is required to review its investment portfolio periodically for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment of its securities, taking into consideration current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, volatility of earnings, current analysts\u2019 evaluations, the Company\u2019s ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of amortized cost, as well as other factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of these factors could require the Company to deem particular securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired, with the credit related portion of the reduction in the value required to be recognized as a charge to the Company\u2019s earnings. Market volatility can make it extremely challenging to accurately value certain securities the Company holds. Subsequent periodic valuations of securities, taking into consideration then prevailing factors, may result in changes to valuations. Significant negative changes to valuations could result in impairments in the value of the Company\u2019s securities portfolio, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial conditions.\nImpairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on the Company's results of operations. Goodwill arises when the Company acquires a business for an amount greater than the net fair value of the assets of the acquired business. The Bank has recognized goodwill as an asset on the balance sheet in connection with several acquisitions (see Note 6, \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof). Goodwill is an intangible asset. When an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life, it is not amortized, and instead is evaluated for impairment. The Company conducts goodwill impairment tests annually, or more frequently if necessary. The Company evaluates goodwill using a qualitative or two-step impairment testing approach. A significant and sustained decline in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in the Company\u2019s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or other factors could result in a finding of impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. If the Company were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then the Company would record the appropriate charge to earnings, which could have material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition.\nDeterioration in the performance or financial position of the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) of Boston might restrict the FHLB of Boston\u2019s ability to meet the funding needs of its members, cause a suspension of its dividend, and cause its stock to be determined to be impaired. Significant components of the Bank\u2019s liquidity needs are met through its access to funding pursuant to its membership in the FHLB of Boston. The FHLB is a cooperative that provides services to its member banking institutions. The primary reason for joining the FHLB is to obtain funding. The purchase of stock in the FHLB is a requirement for a member to gain access to funding. Any deterioration in the FHLB\u2019s performance or financial condition may affect the Company\u2019s ability to access funding and/or require the Company to deem the required investment in FHLB stock to be impaired. If the Company is not able to access funding, it may not be able to meet its liquidity needs, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition. Similarly, if the Company deems all or part of its investment in FHLB stock impaired, such action could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition.\nReductions in the value of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. A deferred tax asset is created by the tax effect of the differences between an asset\u2019s book value and its tax basis. The Company assesses the deferred tax assets periodically to determine the likelihood of the Company\u2019s ability to realize the benefits. These assessments consider the performance of the associated business and its ability to generate future taxable income. If the information available to the Company at the time of assessment indicates there is a greater than 50% chance that the Company will not realize the deferred tax asset benefit, the Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset and reduce its future deferred tax assets to the amount the Company believes could be realized. Recording such a valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition. Additionally the deferred tax assets are determined using effective tax rates expected to apply to the Company's taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Accordingly, a change in statutory tax rates may result in a decrease/increase to the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. A decrease in the Company's deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nEvolving information technologies, the need to mitigate against and react to cyber-security risks, and electronic fraud risks require significant resources, and notwithstanding our investment in resources, we remain subject to cyber security risks and electronic fraud. The Company needs to invest in information technology to keep pace with technology changes, and while the Company invests amounts it believes will be adequate, it may fail to invest adequate amounts to meet operation needs. The risk of electronic fraudulent activity within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber attacks (crime committed through or involving the internet, such as phishing, hacking, denial of service attacks, stealing information, unauthorized intrusions into internal systems or the systems of the Company's third party vendors could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations or damage its reputation. The Company's information technology infrastructure and systems may be vulnerable to cyber terrorism, computer viruses, system failures and other intentional or unintentional interference, fraud and other unauthorized attempts to access or interfere with the systems. A breach of these security controls and the occurrence of one or more of these incidents could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, any such occurrences could result in regulatory actions (including fines), litigation, unexpected costs and expenses, third-party damages or other loss or liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis, which could expose it to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is required to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and other laws and regulations in the United States. These laws and regulations require the Company, among other things, to adopt and enforce \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed, require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision.\nWhile the Company has adopted policies and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing the use of its banking network for money laundering and related activities, those policies and procedures may not completely eliminate instances in which the Company may be used by customers to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities. To the extent the Company fails to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, banking agencies have the authority to impose fines and other penalties on the Company. In addition, the Company\u2019s business and reputation could suffer if customers use its banking network for money laundering or illegal or improper purposes.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on maintaining the trust and confidence of customers and other market participants, and the Company's reputation is critical to its business. The Company\u2019s ability to originate and maintain accounts and business is highly dependent upon the perceptions of borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of the Company\u2019s business practices and financial health. The Company\u2019s reputation is vulnerable to threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries, actual or alleged incidents of employee misconduct and rumors, among other things, can substantially damage the Company\u2019s reputation, even if the inquiries, allegations, or rumors are baseless or satisfactorily addressed. Adverse perceptions regarding the Company\u2019s reputation in the consumer, commercial and funding markets could result in difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts and business, as well as in financing accounts and the Company's business. Further, adverse perceptions can result in decreases in the levels of deposits that customers and potential customers choose to maintain with the Company, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nClaims and litigation could result in losses and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. From time to time as part of the Company\u2019s normal course of business, customers, bankruptcy trustees, former customers, contractual counterparties, third parties and former employees make claims and take legal action against the Company based on its actions or inactions. If such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services. This may also impact customer demand for\nthe Company\u2019s products and services. Any financial liability could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Any reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. See the \"Other Contingencies\" section under Note 18 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and significant pending lawsuits, if applicable.\nIf the Company\u2019s risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate the Company\u2019s risks, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and the results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The Company\u2019s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. The Company has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which it's subject, including credit risk, operations risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The Company seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures and reporting requirements. Management of the Company\u2019s risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models, which in turn rely on assumptions and estimates. If the models used to mitigate these risks are inadequate, or the assumption or estimates are inaccurate or otherwise flawed, the Company may fail to adequately protect against risks and may incur losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that the Company has not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated, which could lead to unexpected losses and the Company's results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nSome of the Company's accounting policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the value of its assets and liabilities and results of operations and if actual events differ from the Company's estimates and assumptions the results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Certain accounting policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities and results of operations. The Company identified the accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, security valuations and impairments, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes to be critical because these policies require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments, estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Under each of these policies, it is possible that materially different values and results of operations would be reported under different conditions, different judgments, or different estimates or assumptions. Further, as new information becomes available, the Company may make a determination to refine or change its judgments, estimates and assumptions, any of which could materially adversely affect the value of the assets and liabilities or the results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change applicable guidance governing the form and content of the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. GAAP, such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators, may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Such changes are expected to continue, and may accelerate, dependent upon the FASB and International Accounting Standards Boards commitment to achieving convergence between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Changes in U.S. GAAP and current interpretations are beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how the Company reports its financial results and condition. In certain cases, the Company could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently (also retroactively) which may result in the Company restating prior period financial statements for material amounts. Additionally, significant changes to U.S. GAAP may require costly technology changes, additional training and personnel, and other expenses which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company may be required to increase its allowance for credit losses as a result of changes to an accounting standard. In 2016, the FASB released a new standard for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses. The new standard will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2020. The new credit loss model will be a significant change from the standard in place today, as it requires the allowance for credit losses to be calculated based on current expected credit losses (commonly referred to as the \"CECL model\") rather than losses inherent in the portfolio as of a point in time. When adopted, the CECL model will likely increase the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses, which could materially affect its financial condition and future results of operations. The extent of the increase and its impact to the Company\u2019s financial condition is under evaluation, but will ultimately depend upon the nature and characteristics of the Company's portfolio at the adoption date, and the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date; therefore, the potential financial impact is currently unknown.\nThe Company may be unable to adequately manage its liquidity risk, which could affect its ability to meet its obligations as they become due, capitalize on growth opportunities, or pay dividends on its common stock. Liquidity risk refers to managing the Company's liquidity so that it can meet its obligations as the obligations become due, opportunistically capitalize on potential growth opportunities as they arise, or pay dividends on its common stock. The Company's liquidity arises from its ability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is also required to fund various obligations, including credit commitments to borrowers, mortgage and other loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of borrowings, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital\nexpenditures. The Company's liquidity is derived primarily from funding obtained from the FHLB of Boston; retail deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; principal and interest payments on investment securities the Company issues; sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities the Company holds; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe Company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Company\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Company\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although the Company has policies and procedures regarding performance of an environmental review prior to originating certain commercial real estate loans, as well as before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in debt and equity markets or economic downturns could affect the level of assets under management and the demand for other fee-based services. Economic downturns could affect the volume of income earned from and demand for fee-based services. Revenues from the investment management business depend in large part on the level of assets under management and administration. Market volatility that results in customers liquidating investments, as well as lower asset values, can reduce the level of assets under management and administration and decrease the Company's investment management and administration revenues which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company relies on its systems, employees and certain service providers, and if the Company experiences a system failure or if the Company's security measures are compromised or inadequate, the operations could be disrupted or the customer data could be improperly divulged. The Company faces the risk that the design of its controls and procedures, including those designed to mitigate the risk of fraud by employees or outside third parties, may be inadequate or be circumvented, thereby causing delays or failures in detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information. The Company regularly reviews and updates the Company's internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company's controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company may also be subject to disruptions of the systems arising or originating from third party services providers or from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Company's control (including, for example, electrical, internet or telecommunications outages), which may adversely impact our ability to provide service to customers and result in loss, cost and expense or liability. Additionally, the Company's risk exposure to security matters may increase in the future if the Company increases in size and prominence in the financial services industry, as the Company expands internet based and mobile banking tools and products and services, and as a consequence of the risk inherent in system and customer account conversions associated with the integration of acquisition targets. The Company is further exposed to the risk that external service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations on matters of internet security and adequacy of services. (The Company's third party service providers are subject to many if not all of the same risks, including internet vulnerability and fraud operational errors by their respective employees.) While the Company conducts due diligence on service providers and engage in other vendor management risk migration activities designed to mitigate service provider risk, no set of risk management protocols can provide full protection against all risks, and the Company's (or service providers) business continuity plans, risk management processes and procedures or security systems (including security against cybercrime) could be inadequate. While the Company maintains a control framework designed to monitor service provider risks, the failure of a service provider to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements and, if applicable, under service level agreements could be disruptive to the Company's operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company's ability to make opportunistic acquisitions is contingent on regulators granting any requisite approvals. Part of the Company's business strategy includes seeking to make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks, branches, financial institutions, or related businesses from time to time. Any possible acquisition may be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain any such approval in a timely manner or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s effective income tax rate would be adversely affected if the Company's community development entity subsidiaries do not receive additional New Markets Tax Credit awards. As indicated in Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\", the Company\u2019s effective tax rate is determined by a number of factors, including the recognition of federal tax credits in connection with New Markets Tax Credit awards. In 2017, the Company recognized $4.0 million in federal tax credits through New Markets Tax Credit award deployment. Federal government agencies periodically determine New Markets Tax Credit award recipients through a nationwide application process that is highly competitive. While the Company\u2019s community development entity subsidiaries have received four prior New Markets Tax Credit awards, it may not be successful in any current or future New Markets Tax Credit applications. The Company applied for but did not receive a New Markets Tax Credit award in 2017. Further, the New Markets Tax Credit Program is subject to periodic renewal by Congress and it is possible the proposed changes to the Internal Revenue code may reduce or eliminate the program altogether. If the Company does not obtain additional awards the Company's effective tax rate will increase substantially in the future, adversely affecting net income, as existing federal tax credits run off.\nThe Company may experience losses and expenses if security interests granted for loans are not enforceable. When the Bank makes loans it sometimes obtains liens, such as real estate mortgages or other asset pledges, to provide the Bank with a security interest in collateral. If there is a loan default the Bank may seek to foreclose upon collateral and enforce the security interests to obtain repayment and eliminate or mitigate the Company's loss. Drafting errors, recording errors, other defects or imperfections in the security interests granted to the Bank and/or changes in law may render liens granted to the Bank unenforceable. The Company may incur losses or expenses if security interests granted to the Bank are not enforceable.", "PERMNO": 10252, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "INDB"}
