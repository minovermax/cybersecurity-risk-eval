{"cik": "1084384", "company": "PARETEUM Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial statements contained in Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 on Form 10-K/A and in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including regulatory, stockholder or other actions, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.\nOn October 21, 2019, our board of directors determined that the Company\u2019s financial statements that were included in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2018 and quarterly reports for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 (collectively, the \u201cNon-Reliance Periods\u201d) should no longer be relied upon. Similarly, related press releases, earnings releases, and investor communications describing the Company\u2019s financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods should no longer be relied upon. The Company restated its financial statements for a portion of the Non-Reliance Periods in the previously filed amendments to our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 on Form 10-K/A. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains restated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods in 2019.\nAs a result of these restatements and associated non-reliance on previously issued financial information, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and the remediation of our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, the attention of our management team has been diverted by these efforts. In addition, we have become subject to, and could also be subject to additional, stockholder, governmental, regulatory or other actions or demands in connection with the restatement or other matters. Any such proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, consume a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. If we do not prevail in any such proceedings, we could be required to pay damages or settlement costs. In addition, the restatement and related matters could impair our reputation or could cause our customers, stockholders, or other counterparties to lose confidence in us. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In connection with the restatement of our financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods, our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this report. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Further, management determined that control deficiencies existed with respect to certain aspects of our historical financial reporting and, accordingly, management has concluded that management\u2019s reports related to the effectiveness of internal and disclosure controls may not have been correct. As a result, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price are possible.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in a global economic downturn. As a response to the spread of COVID-19 many countries, including the U.S., Great Britain and other jurisdictions in Europe, South America and the Middle East where we have employees, have been taking measures designated to limit the continued spread of COVID-19, including the closure of workplaces, restricting travel, prohibiting assembling, closing international borders and quarantining populated areas. Governments around the world have passed temporary emergency orders requiring all residents to remain in their homes along with limitations on which businesses are allowed to remain open and the number of workers allowed at each site. Although many of these orders have been partially lifted in certain jurisdictions, the effects of these indefinite travel restrictions and alternative working arrangements are unknown, may negatively impact the productivity of our employee base, and may have a negative effect on our sales and operations functions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWhile the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown at this time, we are closely monitoring the developments and continually assessing the potential impact on our business. Our business may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak due to the following risks, any of which may lead to an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022 a number of our employees may be infected and/or subject to quarantine periods and may be unable to perform their duties and our offices may be forced to operate with a reduced workforce and/or be forced to close under the temporary emergency regulations. This may lead to ineffective control over our business and a lower work efficiency, productivity and financial performance;\n\u2022 a reduced workforce, lack of international travel, and few face-to-face meetings with customers and potential customers may adversely affect our operations;\n\u2022 we may experience difficulties in collecting amounts due from customers, including major customers, due to a downturn in their financial condition; and\n\u2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees have moved to work from their homes and remotely access our IT networks. Such remote working mode creates the risk of attacking the end-point user stations, connection channels and gateways. These potential breaches of our security measures may harm our business.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our sales were conducted in person. Currently, as a result of the work and travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our sales and professional services activities are being conducted remotely. As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not yet know the extent of the negative impact on our ability to attract, serve or retain customers. Furthermore, as a result of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as general economic uncertainty and associated macroeconomic conditions, existing and potential customers may choose to reduce or delay technology spending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, or attempt to renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, which may materially and negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and prospects. This could result in reductions in sales of our platform and services, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Any of these events could harm our business and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that cloud-based collaborative work management and productivity spending levels will increase following any recovery, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe number of companies whose employees are working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government-ordered shutdowns has caused use of our platform to increase. If our data centers are unable to keep up with this increased usage, customers may experience delays or interruptions in service, which could result in the loss of customers who use our communications platform because of its reliability and performance, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur independent auditor\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 contains a paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and cash flows, we will not have sufficient resources to fund our operations and meet the obligations specified in the documents governing our convertible financing for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. As a result, we believe that additional capital will be required to fund our operations. To access capital to fund operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under our outstanding convertible note, we may need to restructure our convertible indebtedness and raise capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted world financial markets, negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to seek out additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the suspension of trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. For these reasons, the audit report of our independent registered public accountants on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 contains an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe current economic climate, especially in Europe, may have an adverse effect in the markets in which we operate.\nMuch of our customers\u2019 business is consumer driven, and to the extent there is a decline in consumer spending, our customers could experience a reduction in the demand for their services and consequently affect the demand for our services and a decrease in our revenues, net income and an increase in bad debts arising from non-payment of our trade receivables. The potential adverse effects of an economic downturn include:\n\u2022 reduced demand for services, resulting in increased price competition or deferrals of purchases, with lower revenues not fully compensated through reduced costs;\n\u2022 risk of financial difficulties or failures among our suppliers;\n\u2022 increased demand for customer finance, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable and increased risk of counterparty default;\n\u2022 risk of impairment losses related to our intangible assets as a result of lower forecasted sales of certain products;\n\u2022 increased difficulties in forecasting sales and financial results as well as increased volatility in our reported results; and\n\u2022 end-user demand could also be adversely affected by reduced consumer spending on technology, changed operator pricing, security breaches and trust issues.\nUncertainties and risks associated with international markets could adversely impact our international operations.\nWe have significant international operations in Europe, and to a lesser extent in the U.S., Middle East and elsewhere. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the permits and operating licenses required for us to operate, obtain access to local transmission facilities on economically acceptable terms, or market services in international markets. In addition, operating in international markets generally involves additional risks, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, customs, duties and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, problems in collecting accounts receivable, political risks, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, restrictions associated with the repatriation of funds, technology export and import restrictions, and seasonal reductions in business activity. Our ability to operate and grow our international operations successfully could be adversely impacted by these risks.\nWe operate in a complex regulatory environment, and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to a broad range of complex and evolving laws and regulations. Because of our coverage in many countries, we must perform our services in compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions. Some of these laws and regulations may be difficult to ascertain or interpret and may change from time to time. Violation of such laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, damage our reputation, constitute a breach of our client agreements, impair our ability to obtain and renew required licenses, and decrease our profitability or competitiveness. If any of these effects were to occur, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, to serve our international markets, we maintain business entities in various jurisdictions around the world. Accordingly, we must maintain and operate these business entities in compliance with the applicable corporate, tax, employment and other laws of these various jurisdictions, which adds complexity to our operations. Our failure to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations could give rise to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to integrate new technologies and provide new services in a cost-efficient manner.\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards. We cannot predict the effect of these changes on our competitive position, our profitability or the industry in general. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our networks and our software solutions and require additional capital expenditures or the procurement of additional products that could be expensive and time consuming. In addition, new products and services arising out of technological developments may reduce the attractiveness of our services. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological advances or fail to obtain access to new technologies, we could lose customers and be limited in our ability to attract new customers and/or sell new services to our existing customers. In addition, delivery of new services in a cost-efficient manner depends upon many factors, and we may not generate anticipated revenue from such services.\nWe may not be able to develop and successfully market our mobile telecommunications platform and services as planned.\nPareteum operates in an exceptionally competitive environment where there is continuous innovation and new development. We are required to be a top performer in over a dozen highly specialized domains to effectively compete with our competitors. Ongoing investments are required to stay ahead of the competition. The sales process for our platform and the deployment process may be complicated and very slow. We are highly dependent on convincing mobile network operators and mobile virtual network operators to believe that outsourcing their requirements to us is the best way to go. We are exposed to business risks associated with turnkey projects and the scalability of our service and support organization. Although our policy is to avoid or minimize risks, it cannot be ruled out that in certain cases events occur that may seriously impact us and our performance.\nImplementation and development of our software platform business depends on our ability to obtain adequate funding.\nOur software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. When our available cash and cash equivalents become insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, or if and when we identify additional opportunities to do so, we will likely seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities.\nFailure to obtain such adequate financing will substantially delay our development, slow down current operations, result in loss of customers and adversely impact our results of operations. Additionally, the funds we need may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted world financial markets, negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to obtain additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nDisruptions in our networks and infrastructure may result in customer dissatisfaction, customer loss or both, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and business.\nOur systems are an integral part of our customers\u2019 business operations. It is critical for our customers that our systems provide a continued and uninterrupted performance. Customers may be dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide services to them. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our services significantly and could result in decreased demand for our services.\nWe face the following risks to our networks, infrastructure and software applications:\n\u2022 significant weather events can physically damage access lines;\n\u2022 power surges and outages, computer viruses or hacking, earthquakes, terrorism attacks, vandalism and software or hardware defects which are beyond our control; and\n\u2022 unusual spikes in demand or capacity limitations in our or our suppliers\u2019 networks.\nDisruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and/or incur expenses, and thereby adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow.\nCybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could adversely affect our business, and could compromise our information and expose us to liability and reputational harm.\nThe size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. Similarly, we could be subject to liability or our reputation could be harmed if technologies integrated into our products fail to prevent cyberattacks, or if our customers fail to safeguard the systems with security policies that conform to industry best practices. In addition, any cyberattack or security breach that affects a competitor\u2019s product could lead to the negative perception that our products are similarly vulnerable to attacks or breaches.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary and/or personally identifiable information of customers, partners, employees, and other third parties. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures and precautions, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any hack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, lead to reputational harm or loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nIntegration of acquisitions ultimately may not provide the benefits originally anticipated by management and may distract the attention of our personnel from the operation of our business.\nWe strive to broaden our solutions offerings as well as to increase the number of subscribers hosted on our platforms, volume of voice and data that we carry over our existing global network in order to reduce transmission costs and other operating costs as a percentage of net revenue, improve margins, improve service quality and enhance our ability to introduce new products and services. Strategic acquisitions in desired markets play a part of our growth strategy, and we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future to further strengthen our strategic objectives. Acquisitions of businesses and customer lists involve operational risks, including the possibility that an acquisition may not ultimately provide the benefits originally anticipated by management. Moreover, we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates, completing and financing additional acquisitions on favorable terms, or integrating the acquired business or assets into our own. There may be difficulty in integrating technologies and solutions, in migrating customer bases and in integrating the service offerings, distribution channels and networks gained through acquisitions with our own. For example, our recent acquisitions have led to the unexpected addition of a significant amount of aged accounts payable to our balance sheet. Successful integration of operations and technologies requires the dedication of management and other personnel, which may distract their attention from the day-to-day business, the development or acquisition of new technologies, and the pursuit of other business acquisition opportunities. Therefore, successful integration may not occur in light of these factors.\nOur revenue, earnings and profitability are affected by the length of our sales cycle, and a longer sales cycle could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is directly affected by the length of our sales cycle and strategic mobile partnership cycles with mobile network operators and other large enterprises. Our software platforms, outsourced solutions and value-added communication services, are relatively complex and their purchase may involve a significant commitment of mostly human capital, with attendant delays frequently associated with the allocation of substantial human resources and procurement procedures within an organization. The purchase of these types of products typically also requires coordination and agreement across many departments within a potential customer. Delays associated with such timing factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In periods of economic slowdown in the communications industry, which may recur in the current economic climate, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government shutdown orders that have been implemented in many jurisdictions around the world in an effort to slow the spread of the pandemic, our typical sales cycle may lengthen, which means that the average time between our initial contact with a prospective customer and the signing of a sales contract increases. The lengthening of our sales and strategic mobile partnership cycle could reduce growth in our revenue in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause most of our business is conducted outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCurrently most of our net revenue, expenses and capital expenditures are derived and incurred from sales and operations outside the U.S., whereas the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d). The local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country, making the Euro the predominant currency in which our business is conducted. Considering the fact that most income and expenses are not subject to relevant exchange rate differences, it is only at a reporting level that the translation needs to be made to the reporting unit of USD. In the future, we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs outside the U.S., and changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant, and potentially distorting effect (either negative or positive) on the reported results of operations, not necessarily being the result of operations in real terms. Our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the USD/Euro exchange rates.\nWe historically have not engaged in hedging transactions since we primarily operate in same currency countries, currently being the Euro (\u201cEUR\u201d). However, the operations of affiliates and subsidiaries in non-US countries have been funded with investments and other advances denominated in foreign currencies and more recently in USD. Historically, such investments and advances have been long-term in nature, and we have accounted for any adjustments resulting from currency translation as a charge or credit to Accumulated other comprehensive loss within the Stockholders\u2019 Equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although we have not engaged in hedging in the past, we continue to assess on a regular basis the possible need for hedging.\nWe are substantially smaller than our major competitors, whose marketing and pricing decisions, and relative size advantage, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and are likely to continue to cause significant pricing pressures that could adversely affect our net revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur services related to cloud-based communications software and information systems, outsourced solutions and value-added communication services are subject to competitive pressure, and we expect competition to continue to increase. We compete with telecom solution providers, independent software and service providers and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services (including consulting, systems integration and managed services), software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services (such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus) and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment. Also, in this more fragmented market, larger players exist with associated advantages described earlier with which we need to compete against.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022 the development by others of software products that are competitive with our products and services;\n\u2022 the price at which others offer competitive software and services;\n\u2022 the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators;\n\u2022 the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks;\n\u2022 the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own;\n\u2022 the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and\n\u2022 the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel.\nA number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Many of our competitors are also able to offer service at lower prices than we are, forcing us to match their prices in response. This negatively affects our gross margins and financial results of operations. If we fail to effectively compete, we may experience lower revenues and/or net income, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur positioning in the marketplace as a smaller provider places a significant strain on our resources, and if not managed effectively, could result in operational inefficiencies and other difficulties.\nOur positioning in the marketplace may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources, and increase demand on our systems and controls. To manage this position effectively, we must continue to implement and improve our operational and financial systems and controls, invest in development and engineering, critical systems and network infrastructure to maintain or improve our service quality levels, purchase and utilize other systems and solutions, and train and manage our employee base. As we proceed with our development, operational difficulties could arise from additional demand placed on customer provisioning and support, billing and management information systems, product delivery and fulfillment, sales and marketing and administrative resources.\nFor instance, we may encounter delays or cost overruns or suffer other adverse consequences in implementing new systems when required. In addition, our operating and financial control systems and infrastructure could be inadequate to ensure timely and accurate financial reporting, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe need to grow our business and revenue in order to achieve profitability.\nWe need to expand our network to maintain and grow our business and revenue. If we fail to expand and maintain an effective sales force or successfully develop our relationships with new customers, our business, prospects and brand may be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully grow our client base or expand the number of services provided to them. If we fail to do so, our sales could fail to grow or could decline, and our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected, which could prevent our revenues from covering our fixed costs and deny the Company operating leverage, delaying the date at which we achieve profitability. Accordingly, if we do not grow our revenue and business, we will not achieve profitability in the near term, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if U.S. or foreign taxing authorities do not agree with our interpretation of applicable tax laws.\nOur corporate structure is based, in part, on assumptions about the various tax laws, including withholding tax, and other relevant laws of applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions. Foreign taxing authorities may not agree with our interpretations or reach different conclusions. Our interpretations are not binding on any taxing authority and, if these foreign jurisdictions were to change or to modify the relevant laws, we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences or have the anticipated benefits of our corporate structure materially impaired. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, that, if not remediated, or if we identify additional material weaknesses or other adverse findings in the future, may not allow us to be able to report our financial condition or results of operations accurately or timely, which may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies, and ultimately have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report, our management identified material weaknesses in internal controls related to:\n\u2022 Inadequate and ineffective management assessment of internal control over financial reporting, including insufficient experienced resources to complete the documentation of internal control assessment;\n\u2022 Ineffective design, implementation and monitoring of information technology general controls pertaining to the Company\u2019s change management process;\n\u2022 entity-level controls were not effective due to certain executive management \u201ctone at the top\u201d issues which contributed to an ineffective control environment and to deficiencies aggregating to material weaknesses; and\n\u2022 the Company not having sufficient accounting and finance department resources to effectively assess risk and design, operate and oversee effective internal controls over financial reporting, which contributed to the failure in the effectiveness and adequate identification of certain controls including:\no application of appropriate revenue recognition standards;\no proper accounting of share-based compensation;\no appropriate settlement of payables via issuance of shares;\no complete and appropriate application of foreign currency translations;\no identification and accounting of operating leases in accordance with ASC 842; and\no method of accounting for acquisitions and business combinations.\nAs a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019. As described in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report, we are implementing remedial measures that we believe will effectively remedy the material weakness. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness timely and sufficiently, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we could suffer future material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could harm our operating results and lead to a decline in our stock price. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject regulatory investigations, civil or criminal sanctions and class action litigation.\nWe must attract and retain skilled personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain technical, technical sales and operational employees, our business could be harmed.\nOur ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent on our ability to develop and retain an effective sales force and qualified technical and managerial personnel. We need software development specialists with in-depth knowledge of a blend of IT and telecommunications or with a blend of security and telecommunications. We intend to hire additional necessary employees, including software engineers, communication engineers, project managers, sales consultants, employees and operational employees, on a permanent basis. The competition for qualified technical sales, technical, and managerial personnel in the communications and software industry is intense in the markets where we operate, and we may not be able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel. In addition, we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations, control our costs, maintain compliance with all applicable regulations, and expand our internal management, technical, information and accounting systems in order to support our desired growth, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. Volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish our use, and the value, of our equity awards as incentives to employees, putting us at a competitive disadvantage or forcing us to use more cash compensation. Accordingly, our failure to attract and retain skilled personnel may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are not able to use and protect our intellectual property domestically and internationally, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to use intellectual property internationally. We rely on a combination of patents, copyright, trade secrets and confidentiality, trademarks and licenses to protect our intellectual property. There is limited protection under patent law to protect the source codes we developed or acquired on our platform. The copyright and know-how protection on which we rely may not be sufficient. Our granted patents and pending patent applications may be challenged. We are also subject to the risks of claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. The telecommunications industry is subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We rely upon certain technology, including hardware and software, licensed from third parties. The technology licensed by us may not continue to provide competitive features and functionality. Licenses for technology currently used by us or other technology that we may seek to license in the future may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on one significant customer for a substantial portion of our business and the loss of this customer could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had one significant customer that accounted for 20% and 64% of our revenue, respectively. Although no other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our net sales during this period, other customers may account for more than 10% of our net sales in future periods. Additionally, because many of our other customers produce net losses for us, the loss, or reduction in services to this significant customer or other discontinuation of their relationship with us for any reason, or if this significant customer reduces or postpones purchases that we expect to receive, it could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our continued investment in research and development, the level and effectiveness of which could reduce our profitability.\nWe intend to continue to make investments in research and development and product development in seeking to sustain and improve our competitive position and meet our customers\u2019 needs. These investments currently include streamlining our suite of software functionalities, including modularization and improving scalability of our integrated solutions. To maintain our competitive position, we may need to increase our research and development investment, which could reduce our profitability and cash flows, thereby causing a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will achieve a return on these investments, nor can we assure you that these investments will improve our competitive position or meet our customers\u2019 needs.\nProduct defects or software errors could adversely affect our business.\nDesign defects or software errors may cause delays in product introductions and project implementations, damage customer satisfaction and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our software systems are highly complex and may, from time to time, contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and correct. Because our products are generally used by our customers to perform critical business functions, design defects, software errors, misuse of our products, incorrect data from external sources or other potential problems within or outside of our control may arise during implementation or from the use of our products and may result in financial or other damages to our customers, for which we may be held responsible. Although we have license agreements with our customers that contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from customer problems, these provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions. Our insurance coverage is not sufficient to protect against all possible liability for defects or software errors. In addition, as a result of business and other considerations, we may undertake to compensate our customers for damages caused to them arising from the use of our products, even if our liability is limited by a license or other agreement. Claims and liabilities arising from customer problems could also damage our reputation, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPolitical risks, including changes to U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on our business.\nThere have been recent changes to U.S. trade policies, treaties and tariffs, including determinations made by the U.S. to reinstate or impose new sanctions levied by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control against certain nation states. The Company or its subsidiaries may engage in business with entities located in certain regions which may be impacted, directly or indirectly by such changes. If the Company is precluded as a result of changes to sanctions laws from doing business in certain jurisdictions or with certain entities, the loss of any related revenues could impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe, and certain of our directors and current and former officers, have been named as parties to various lawsuits and those lawsuits could adversely affect us, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against us, including securities class action complaints. If these matters cannot be resolved expeditiously, management\u2019s attention may be diverted to this matter and there can be no assurance that the litigation would be settled. If the current litigation proceeds or if additional claims are filed, the legal and other costs associated with the defense of these actions and their ultimate outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we expect insurance to cover many of the costs associated with defending such litigation, insurance coverage may be insufficient and could require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.\nAlthough we have directors and officers liability insurance, such insurance may be insufficient to cover the liabilities incurred under all claims and any claims against us may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources.\nAlthough we have directors and officers liability insurance, the coverage under such policies may be insufficient to cover any claim, including the claims pending against us and certain of our directors and officers resulting from the restatement of our financial statements (see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d). Because we also have obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors under our governing documents, liabilities in excess of the limits of our insurance policies that may be imposed in connection with actions against certain of the Company\u2019s past and present directors and officers and certain current and former employees who are entitled to indemnification will be funded by the Company with its existing cash resources. Such expenses could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nChanges in the regulation of the telecommunications industry could adversely affect our business, revenue or cash flow.\nWe operate in a heavily regulated industry. As a provider of communications technology, we are directly and indirectly subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide our services. Local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, differ significantly among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Enforcement and interpretations of these laws and regulations can be unpredictable and are often subject to the informal views of government officials. Certain European, foreign, U.S. federal, and state regulations and local franchise requirements have been, are currently, and may in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals. Such proceedings may relate to, among other things, the rates we may charge for our local, network access and other services, the manner in which we offer and bundle our services, the terms and conditions of interconnection, unbundled network elements and resale rates, and could change the manner in which telecommunications companies operate. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the impact they will have on our business, revenue and cash flow.\nThere can be no assurance that future regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us, or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues regarding our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon us. Potential future regulatory, judicial, legislative, and government policy changes in jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on us. Domestic or international regulators or third parties may raise material issues regarding our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations, and therefore may have a material adverse impact on our competitive position, growth and financial performance.\nThe telecommunications industry is rapidly changing, and if we are not able to adjust our strategy and resources effectively in the future to meet changing market conditions, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation, privatization, consolidation, technological improvements, availability of alternative services such as mobile, broadband, DSL, Internet, VOIP, and wireless DSL through use of the fixed wireless spectrum, and the globalization of the world\u2019s economies. In addition, alternative services to traditional land-line services, such as mobile, broadband, Internet and VOIP services, have shown a competitive threat to our legacy land-line traffic business. If we do not continue to invest and exploit the contemplated plan of development of our communications information systems, outsourced solutions and value-added communication services to meet changing market conditions, or if we do not have adequate resources, we may not be able to compete effectively in providing technology solutions to our customers. The telecommunications industry is marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and technological improvements. Achieving successful financial results will depend on our ability to anticipate, assess and adapt to rapid technological changes, and offer, on a timely and cost-effective basis, services including the bundling of multiple services into our technology platforms that meet evolving industry standards. If we do not anticipate, assess or adapt to such technological changes at a competitive price, maintain competitive services or obtain new technologies on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, our financial results may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to operate a cost-effective network, we may not be able to grow our business successfully.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to design, implement, operate, manage and maintain a reliable and cost-effective network. In addition, we rely on third parties to enable us to expand and manage our global network and to provide local, broadband Internet and mobile services. If we are unable to grow and operate a cost-effective network for our customers, our business may fail to grow or decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Stock\nCovenant restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our flexibility to operate and grow our business, and if we are not able to comply with such covenants, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness, proceed against certain collateral or exercise other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOn June 8, 2020, we closed the issuance of $17.5 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2020 Note\u201d) under the terms of a securities purchase agreement, also dated as of June 8, 2020 (together with the 2020 Note, the \u201cNote Facility\u201d). The covenants in the Note Facility documents contain a number of provisions that impose operating and financial restrictions which, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions or redeem or repurchase our securities, make certain investments, grant liens on assets, sell or dispose of any material assets; and acquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies. Additionally, the Note Facility documents contain affirmative covenants that require to us take, and have taken by certain dates, specific actions, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including (i) us filing our restated Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the SEC on or prior to October 31, 2020, (ii) after October 31, 2020, our timely filing subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC and (iii) us maintaining the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, on December 1, 2020, we entered into a forbearance agreement with the holder of the 2020 Note under which we admitted that we were in default of several obligations and such holder acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the Note Facility documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the 2020 Note, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 (since extended to March 31, 2021), the date of any new event of default or the initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in such forbearance agreement.\nComplying with these covenants, as well as those that may be contained in any future debt agreements, may limit our ability to finance our future operations or working capital needs or to take advantage of future business opportunities. Our ability to comply with these covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by events beyond our control. If we do not maintain and regain compliance with our continuing obligations or any covenants, terms and conditions of the Note Facility, after the expiration of the forbearance agreement, we could be in default and required to repay outstanding borrowings on an accelerated basis, which could subject us to decreased liquidity and other negative impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the case of an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under the Note Facility. If we are unable to repay amounts owed under the terms of our Note Facility, the lenders thereunder may choose to exercise their remedies in respect to the collateral, including a foreclosure of their lien which may result in a sale of certain of our assets to satisfy our obligations under the Note Facility.\nWe could issue additional common stock, which might dilute the book value of our capital stock.\nOur Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or a part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Any such stock issuance could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium to the then-current trading price of our common stock. In addition, in order to raise future capital, we may need to issue securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for a significant amount of our common stock. These issuances, if any, would dilute your percentage ownership interest in the Company, thereby having the effect of reducing your influence on matters on which stockholders vote. You may incur additional dilution if holders of stock options, whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted, exercise their options, or if warrant holders exercise their warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. As a result, any such issuances or exercises would dilute your interest in the Company and the per share book value of the common stock that you owned, either of which could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of your investment.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there are (i) 6,704,803 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, 37,298,850 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and 29,166,667 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the conversion of outstanding convertible indebtedness. Options are exercisable at exercise prices between $0.36 and $62.50 and the warrants are exercisable at exercise prices between $0.37 and $5.38. Accrued interest owed on the 2020 Note may also be paid in the form of shares of our common stock from time to time. If and when these securities are exercised or converted into shares of our common stock, the number of our shares of common stock outstanding will increase. Such increase in our outstanding shares, and any subsequent sales of such shares, could have a material adverse effect on the market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, from time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six month holding period: (i) affiliated stockholders (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and (ii) non-affiliated stockholders may sell without such limitations, provided that we are current in our public reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliates that have satisfied a one year holding period without any limitation or restriction. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOn November 10, 2020, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notified the Company that, because of the Company\u2019s failure to satisfy the conditions to the exception to Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards granted by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, our common stock would be delisted, and trading of our common stock on Nasdaq\u2019s Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020. After trading of the Company\u2019s common stock was suspended by Nasdaq, prices for our common stock began being quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market (the \u201cPink Sheets\u201d). The delisting became effective on February 12, 2021. The Pink Sheets is a significantly more limited market than Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. The quotation of our shares on the Pink Sheets may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all.\nBecause our common stock is no longer listed on a registered national securities exchange, we are subject to certain \u201cblue sky\u201d laws of the various states that impose restrictions on our ability to offer and sell our securities. These \u201cblue sky\u201d laws may make it more difficult for us to raise capital or to issue our common stock for equity compensation or other strategic purposes, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations or to attract and retain employees.\nIn addition, our common stock may be classified as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d are subject to Rule 15g-9, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. For transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and affect the ability of holders to sell their shares of our common stock in the secondary market. To the extent our common stock is subject to the penny stock regulations, the market liquidity for the shares will be adversely affected and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe have no dividend history and have no intention to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid dividends on or in connection with our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends to common stockholders for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 13121, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "TEUM"}
