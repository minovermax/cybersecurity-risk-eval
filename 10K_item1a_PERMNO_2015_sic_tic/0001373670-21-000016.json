RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. Any of these risks could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information contained under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic and resulting worldwide economic conditions are adversely affecting, and will continue to adversely affect, our business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. This virus continues to spread globally and in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, and disrupted global supply chains. In addition, there have been extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by international, federal, state, and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in regions across the United States and the world, including quarantines and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many\nbusinesses to curtail or cease normal operations. While many of these quarantines and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders were lifted in the latter half of the second quarter, based on the recent surge of COVID-19 cases in parts of the country in which we operate, there are concerns that state and local public health and governmental authorities could reimpose restrictions that would affect the economy in general and our operations.\nOur first focus in addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was implementing steps to minimize the risk to our employees, trade partners and customers. While residential homebuilding is considered an essential service in each of the markets in which we operate, we are still taking steps to increase the safety of our employees, trade partners and customers. For example, we (1) initially closed our sales centers, model homes, and design centers to the general public and shifted to appointment-only interactions with our customers and have now shifted more traffic to walk-in appointments and are following recommended social distancing and other health and safety protocols when meeting in person with a customer, (2) modified our construction operations to enforce enhanced safety protocols around social distancing, hygiene, and health screening and (3) modified our corporate and division office functions in order to allow all of our employees to work remotely except for essential minimum basic operations which could only be done in an office setting.\nFrom a business standpoint, the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responsive actions taken by federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities resulted in a significant downturn in sales activity in our operations and the homebuilding industry as a whole. For example, in the final two weeks of March and through the end of April, the impact of shelter-in-place/stay-at-home restrictions materially reduced our new home sales in March and April, as compared to the same period in the prior year, and increased cancellations. However, as stay-at-home orders and quarantines were lifted, we began to see significant uptick in sales activity in the latter part of the second quarter and throughout the third and fourth quarters. Nevertheless, there are still significant concerns of the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy in general and the housing market specifically. For example, we are currently experiencing supply chain issues with the availability of appliances, windows, and cost of lumber and may experience other adverse impacts on our supply chain, including availability and cost, if the international flow of goods is not normalized. These delays and additional costs could impact our ability to close sales at our anticipated pace and reduce margins. Our financial performance and our future operational results will depend on the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic (including any variant thereof) and related government restrictions, the impact of unemployment rates, and other health and economic factors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nAs we began to see increased market activity, we re-initiated much of the previously planned capital expenditures that we had placed on hold in March based on market uncertainty. Specifically, we restarted construction of unsold units, recommenced purchases of lots and land and resumed development of land to reflect the market activity. The length and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and the homebuilding industry is difficult to estimate as is the potential mitigating effects of economic relief efforts on the U.S. economy, unemployment, consumer confidence, demand for our homes and the mortgage market, including lending standards and secondary mortgage markets. However, if there is a prolonged economic downturn and/or an extended rise in unemployment or tempering of wage growth, we would expect to experience, among other things, increases in the cancellation rates for homes in our backlog, and decreases in our net new sales orders, homes delivered, revenues, and profitability. We could also be forced to reduce our average selling prices in order to generate consumer demand or in reaction to competitive pressures. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe homebuilding industry is cyclical. A severe downturn in the industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nThe residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions such as levels of employment, consumer confidence and income, availability of financing for acquisitions, construction and permanent mortgages, interest rate levels, inflation and demand for housing. The U.S. housing market could be negatively impacted by declining consumer confidence, restrictive mortgage standards and large supplies of foreclosures, resales and new homes, among other factors. When combined with a prolonged economic downturn, high unemployment levels, increases in the rate of inflation and uncertainty in the U.S. economy, these conditions could contribute to decreased demand for housing, declining sales prices and increasing pricing pressure. In the event that demand for housing stalls or declines, we could experience declines in the market value of our inventory and demand for our lots, homes and construction loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.\nReal estate investments are subject to various risks and fluctuations and cycles in value and demand, many of which are beyond our control. Certain events may decrease cash available for operations, as well as the value of our real estate assets. These events include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022adverse changes in international, national or local economic and demographic conditions;\n\u2022adverse changes in financial conditions of buyers and sellers of properties, particularly residential homes and land suitable for development of residential homes;\n\u2022competition from other real estate investors with significant capital, including other real estate operating companies and developers and institutional investment funds;\n\u2022fluctuations in interest rates, which could adversely affect the ability of homebuyers to obtain financing on favorable terms or their willingness to obtain financing at all;\n\u2022unanticipated increases in expenses, including, without limitation, insurance costs, development costs, real estate assessments and other taxes and costs of compliance with laws, regulations and governmental policies; and\n\u2022changes in enforcement of laws, regulations and governmental policies, including, without limitation, health, safety, environmental, zoning and tax laws.\nAdverse changes in macroeconomic conditions in and around the markets we operate in, and where prospective purchasers of our homes live, could reduce the demand and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in markets where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of our homes live have had and may in the future have a negative impact on our business. Adverse changes in employment and median income levels, job growth, consumer confidence, interest rates, perceptions regarding the strength of the housing market, and population growth, or an oversupply of homes for sale may reduce demand or depress prices for our homes and cause home buyers to cancel their agreements to purchase our homes. This, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\nIn addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in a general decline in the purchase of homes or an increased incidence of home order cancellations. If we cannot successfully implement our business strategy, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation or deflation.\nInflation can adversely affect our homebuilding operations by increasing costs of land, financing, materials, labor and construction. While we attempt to pass on cost increases to homebuyers through increased prices, in a weak housing market, we may not be able to offset cost increases with higher selling prices. In addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on housing demand. In a highly inflationary environment, depending on industry and other economic conditions, we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. Moreover, with inflation, the costs of capital increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources could decline. Current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nAlternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could lead to a deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation could also cause the value of our inventory to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance, which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes and have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the continued availability and satisfactory performance of subcontractors which, if unavailable, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe conduct our land development and homebuilding operations primarily as a general contractor. Virtually all land development and construction work is performed by unaffiliated third-party subcontractors. As a consequence, the timing and quality of the development of our land and the construction of our homes depends on the availability and skill of our subcontractors. There may not be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third-party subcontractors in the markets in which we operate. If there are inadequate subcontractor resources, our ability to meet customer demands, both timing and quality, could be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our future growth and our profitability.\nLabor and raw material shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of land development and home construction, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe residential construction industry experiences labor and raw material shortages from time to time, including shortages in qualified tradespeople and supplies such as insulation, drywall, cement, steel and lumber. These labor and raw material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods when a region in which we operate experiences a natural disaster that has a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures. When new home demand increases significantly, such as we have seen since the second half of 2020, increased demand for the raw materials, products and appliances for new homes can contribute to extended lead times, supply shortages and price increases. For example, we have recently and may continue to experience price increases, shortages and significant extensions to our lead time for the delivery of materials such as lumber, appliances and windows. This has and may continue to result in longer construction periods, delays in home closings and margin compression if we are unable to increase our sales prices accordingly.\nThe cost of labor and raw materials may also be adversely affected during periods of shortage or high inflation. Shortages and price increases could cause delays in, and increase our costs of, land development and home construction, which we may not be able to recover by raising home prices due to market demand and because the price for each home is typically set prior to its delivery pursuant to the agreement of sale with the homebuyer. In addition, the federal government has, at various times during 2019 and 2020, imposed tariffs on a variety of imports from foreign countries and may impose additional tariffs in the future. Significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on raw materials that we use in our homebuilding operation, such as lumber or steel, could cause the cost of home construction to increase which we may not be able to recover by raising home prices or which could slow our absorption due to being constrained by market demand. As a result, shortages or increased costs of labor and raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to recruit, retain and develop highly skilled, competent employees may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nKey employees, including management team members at both the corporate and homebuilder subsidiary levels, are fundamental to our ability to obtain, generate and manage opportunities. If any of the management team members were to cease employment with us, our results of operations could suffer. Our ability to retain our management team or to attract suitable replacements should any members of its management team leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key management team members or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. In addition, we do not maintain key person insurance in respect of any member of our named executive officers.\nIn addition, key employees working in the land development, homebuilding and construction industries are highly sought after. Experienced employees in the homebuilding, land acquisition and construction industries are fundamental to our ability to generate, obtain and manage opportunities. In particular, local knowledge and relationships are critical to our ability to source attractive land acquisition opportunities. Failure to attract and retain such personnel or to ensure that their experience and knowledge is not lost when they leave the business through retirement, redundancy or otherwise may adversely affect the standards of our service and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to acquire undeveloped land, partially finished developed lots and finished lots suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices, in accordance with our land investment criteria.\nThe homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land and the risk inherent in purchasing and developing land is directly impacted by changes in consumer demand for housing. The availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our investment criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers, inflation in land prices, zoning, allowable housing density, the ability to obtain building permits and other regulatory requirements. Should suitable land or lots become more difficult to locate or obtain, the number of lots we may be able to develop and sell could decrease, the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could increase, perhaps substantially, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs competition for suitable land increases, the cost of acquiring both finished and undeveloped lots and the cost of developing owned land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline, which could adversely impact our financial results. The availability of suitable land assets could also affect the success of our land acquisition strategy, which may impact our ability to increase the number of active selling communities, to grow our revenues and margins and to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf we are unable to develop communities successfully or within expected timeframes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBefore a community generates any revenue, time and material expenditures are required to acquire and prepare land, entitle and finish lots, obtain development approvals, pay taxes and construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model homes and sales facilities. It can take several years from the time that we acquire control of a property to the time that we make our first home sale on the site. Delays in the development of communities expose us to the risk of changes in market conditions for homes. A decline in our ability to develop and market our communities successfully and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and on our ability to service our debt and to meet our working capital requirements.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid. As a result, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited and we may be forced to hold non-income producing assets for an extended period of time. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms that we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.\nWe depend on the success of our partially owned controlled builders.\nWe participate in the homebuilding business, in part, through non-wholly owned subsidiaries, which we refer to as our \u201ccontrolled builders.\u201d We are able to exercise control over the operations of each controlled builder. We have entered into arrangements with these controlled builders in order to take advantage of their local knowledge and relationships, acquire attractive land positions and brand images, manage our risk profile and leverage our capital base. Even though the co-investors in our controlled builders are subject to certain non-competition provisions, the viability of our participation in the homebuilding business depends on our ability to maintain good relationships with our controlled builders. Our controlled builders are focused on maximizing the value of their operations and working with a partner that can help them be successful. The effectiveness of our management, the value of our expertise and the rapport we maintain with our controlled builders are important factors for new builders considering doing business with us and may affect our ability to attract homebuyers, subcontractors, employees or others upon whom our business, financial condition and results of operations ultimately depend. Further, our relationships with our controlled builders generate additional business opportunities that support our growth. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our controlled builders, we may be unable to fully take advantage of existing agreements or expand our relationships with these controlled builders. Additionally, our opportunities for pursuing acquisitions of additional builders may be adversely impacted.\nIn Atlanta, we sell lots to our controlled builder for its homebuilding operations and provide it loans to finance home construction. If our controlled builder fails to successfully execute its business strategies for any reason, it may be unable to purchase lots from us, repay outstanding construction finance loans made by us or borrow from us in the future, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn integral component of our growth strategy is the use of controlled builders, joint ventures, partnerships and other strategic investments, and these counterparties\u2019 interests may not be wholly aligned with ours or those of our investors.\nOur controlled builders and the third parties with whom we enter into partnerships, joint ventures or other strategic investments are separate and distinct entities from us. Consequently, these counterparties may have different economic, financial and industry positions from us which could influence their business decisions, including but not limited to strategic decision-making which they believe to be in their best interests but which may not be aligned with those of our shareholders. While we exercise different levels of control over the entities in which we invest or co-invest, our rights may be limited contractually or by statute and we may not be able to ensure that their decisions are in alignment with those of our investors. Disputes between us and these third parties could result in legal proceedings that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. If our counterparties take actions that are not in our best interests it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our profitability.\nIf we are required to either repurchase or sell a substantial portion of the equity interest in our controlled homebuilding subsidiaries, our capital resources and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nThe operating agreements governing our partially owned controlled builders contain buy-sell provisions that may be triggered in certain circumstances. In the event that a buy-sell event occurs, our builder will have the right to initiate a buy-sell process, which may happen at an inconvenient time for us. In the event the buy-sell provisions are exercised at a time when we lack sufficient capital to purchase the remaining equity interest, we may elect to sell our equity interest in the entity. If we are forced to sell our equity interest, we will no longer benefit from the future operations of the applicable entity. If a buy-sell provision is exercised and we elect to purchase the interest in an entity that we do not already own, we may be obligated to\nexpend significant capital in order to complete such acquisition, which may result in our being unable to pursue other investments or opportunities. If either of these events occurs, our revenue and net income could decline or we may not have sufficient capital necessary to implement our growth strategy.\nOur geographic concentration could materially and adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in our current markets should decline.\nIn the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, we principally operate in the counties of Dallas, Collin, Denton, Ellis, Rockwall and Tarrant . In Atlanta, we principally operate in the counties of Fulton, Gwinnett, Cobb, Forsyth, Cherokee and Dekalb. In Florida, we principally operate in the counties of Indian River and St. Lucie. To the extent housing demand and population growth slow in our core markets, our favorable growth outlook may not be realized. Furthermore, we may be unable to compete effectively with the resale home market in our core markets. Because our operations are concentrated in these areas, a prolonged economic downturn in one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and a disproportionately greater impact on us than other homebuilders with more diversified operations. Further, slower rates of population growth or population declines in the DFW, Atlanta or Treasure Coast markets, especially as compared to the high population growth rates in prior years, could affect the demand for housing, causing home prices in these markets to decline and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur developments are subject to government regulation, which could cause us to incur significant liabilities or restrict our business activities.\nOur developments are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number and type of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not yet entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or \u201cslow-growth\u201d or \u201cno-growth\u201d initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development and service fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development. As a result, lot and home sales could decline and costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our current results of operations and our long-term growth prospects.\nChanges in global or regional environmental conditions and governmental actions in response to such changes may adversely affect us by increasing the costs of or restricting our planned or future growth activities.\nThere is growing concern from many members of the scientific community and the general public that an increase in global average temperatures due to emissions of greenhouse gases and other human activities have caused, or will cause, significant changes in weather patterns and increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Government mandates, standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or projected climate change impacts have resulted, and are likely to continue to result, in restrictions on land development in certain areas and increased energy, transportation and raw material costs. Governmental requirements directed at reducing effects on climate could cause us to incur expenses that we cannot recover or that will require us to increase the price of homes we sell to the point that it affects demand for those homes.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by and decrease in the value of our land or homes declines as well as the associated carrying costs.\nWe continuously acquire land for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets, and may in the future acquire land for expansion into new markets. However, the market value of land, building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions, and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values. If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory, we may not be able to generate profits consistent with those we have generated in the past and we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell lots and homes. When market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating, option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable, at which time we may elect to forgo deposits and pre-acquisition costs and terminate such arrangements. In the face of adverse market conditions, we may have substantially higher inventory carrying costs, may have to write down our inventory as a result of impairment and/or may have to sell land or homes at a loss. Any material write-downs of assets, or sales at a loss, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for our homes and lots is dependent on the cost and availability of mortgage financing.\nOur business depends on the ability of our homebuyers, as well as the ability of those who buy homes from the third-party homebuilding entities to which we sell lots (our \u201chomebuilding customers\u201d), to obtain financing for the purchase of their homes. Many of these homebuyers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us or our homebuilding customers. Rising interest rates, decreased availability of mortgage financing or of certain mortgage programs, higher down payment requirements or increased monthly mortgage costs may lead to reduced demand for our homes and lots. Increased interest rates can also hinder our ability to realize our backlog because certain of our home purchase contracts provide homebuyers with a financing contingency. Financing contingencies allow homebuyers to cancel their home purchase contracts in the event that they cannot arrange for adequate financing within a certain time period after the execution of the home purchase contracts. As a result, rising interest rates can decrease our home sales and mortgage originations. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the federal government has a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its conservatorship of Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d), both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, and its insurance of mortgages originated by lenders through the Federal Housing Administration (the \u201cFHA\u201d) and the Veterans Administration (\u201cVA\u201d). The availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including consumer interest rates for such loans, could be adversely affected by a curtailment or cessation of the federal government\u2019s mortgage-related programs or policies. The FHA may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards, raise minimum down payment requirements, impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs and/or limit the number of mortgages it insures. Due to growing federal budget deficits, the U.S. Treasury may not be able to continue supporting the mortgage-related activities of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA and the VA at present levels, or it may revise significantly the federal government\u2019s participation in and support of the residential mortgage market. Because the availability of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA- and VA-backed mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing and selling many of our homes, any limitations, restrictions or changes in the availability of such government-backed financing could reduce our home sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny increase in unemployment or underemployment may lead to an increase in the number of loan delinquencies and property repossessions, which would have an adverse impact on our business.\nPeople who are not employed, are underemployed, who have left the labor force or are concerned about the loss of their jobs are less likely to purchase new homes, may be forced to try to sell the homes they own and may face difficulties in making required mortgage payments. Therefore, any increase in unemployment or underemployment may lead to an increase in the number of loan delinquencies and property repossessions and have an adverse impact on our business both by reducing demand for our homes, lots and construction loans and by increasing the supply of homes for sale.\nIncreases in the after-tax costs of owning a home could prevent reduce demand for our homes and lots.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act made major changes to the Internal Revenue Code that, in part, affect the after-tax cost of owning a home. Specifically, the Tax Act limited the ability of homebuyers to deduct (i) property taxes, (ii) mortgage interest, and (iii) state and local income taxes. Due to such changes, the after-tax cost of owning a new home has increased for many of our potential homebuyers and the potential homebuyers of our homebuilding customers. In addition, if the federal government or a state government further changes its income tax laws to further eliminate or substantially limit these income tax deductions, the after-tax cost of owning a new home would further increase for many of our potential customers. The loss or reduction of these homeowner tax deductions that have historically been available has and could further reduce the perceived affordability of homeownership, and therefore the demand for and sales price of new homes, including ours. In addition, increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives, such as funding schools or road improvements, or increases in insurance premiums can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes, and can have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nThe occurrence of severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism could increase our operating expenses and reduce our revenues and cash flows.\nThe climates and geology of the states in which we operate present increased risks of severe weather and natural disasters. The occurrence of severe weather conditions or natural disasters can delay new home deliveries and lot development, reduce the availability of materials and/or negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas.\nAdditionally, to the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, wildfires or other natural disasters or similar events occur, our homes under construction or our lots under development could be damaged or destroyed, which may result in losses exceeding our insurance coverage. Any of these events could increase our operating expenses, impair our cash flows and reduce our revenues. To the extent that climate change increases the frequency and severity of weather related disasters, we may experience increasing negative weather related impacts to our operations in the future.\nFurther, acts of war, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States and any foreign power or acts of terrorism may cause disruption to the U.S. economy, or the local economies of the markets in which we operate, cause shortages of building materials, increase costs associated with obtaining building materials, result in building code changes that could increase costs of construction, affect job growth and consumer confidence or cause economic changes that we cannot anticipate, all of which could reduce demand for our lots, homes and construction loans and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nHigh cancellation rates may negatively impact our business.\nOur backlog reflects the number and value of homes for which we have entered into non-contingent sales contracts with homebuyers but not yet delivered. Although these sales contracts require a cash deposit, a homebuyer may in certain circumstances cancel the contract and receive a complete or partial refund of the deposit as a result of contract provisions. If home prices decline, the national or local homebuilding environment or general economy weakens, our neighboring competitors reduce their sales prices (or increase their sales incentives), interest rates increase or the availability of mortgage financing tightens, homebuyers may have an incentive to cancel their contracts with us, even where they might be entitled to no refund or only a partial refund. Significant cancellations could have a material adverse effect on our business as a result of lost sales revenue and the accumulation of unsold housing inventory.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against competitors in the homebuilding, land development and financial services industries.\nCompetition in the land development and homebuilding industries is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry. Land developers and homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels for development and resale or homebuilding (or make such acquisitions more expensive), hinder our market share expansion and lead to pricing pressures that adversely impact our margins and revenues. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products. Furthermore, a number of our primary competitors are significantly larger, have a longer operating history and may have greater resources or lower cost of capital than us. Accordingly, competitors may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate. Our homebuilding business also competes for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.\nOur construction financing business competes with other lenders, including national, regional and local banks and other financial institutions, some of which have greater access to capital or different lending criteria and may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential homebuyers.\nOur future growth may include additional strategic investments, joint ventures, partnerships and/or acquisitions of companies that may not be as successful as we anticipate and could disrupt our ongoing businesses and adversely affect our operations.\nOur investments in our homebuilding subsidiaries have contributed to our historical growth and similar investments may be a component of our growth strategy in the future. We may make additional strategic investments, enter into new joint venture or partnership arrangements or acquire businesses, some of which may be significant. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, significant start-up costs, insufficient revenues to offset expenses associated with these new investments and inadequate return of capital on these investments, any of which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to successfully identify and manage future investments, joint ventures, partnerships or acquisitions could harm our results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may increase our costs, limit the areas in which we can build homes and develop land and delay completion of our projects.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding or development site vary according to\nmultiple factors, including the site\u2019s location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding and land development activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders\u2019 compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to comply strictly with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to our business may increase our costs. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders and land developers in the future.\nUnder various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including for bodily injury, and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nBuilding sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the land development and homebuilding industries poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements, health and safety performance is critical to the success of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities and our ability to attract employees, subcontractors and homebuyers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPoor relations with the residents of our communities, or with local real estate agents, could negatively impact our home sales, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.\nResidents of communities we develop rely on us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities. Efforts made by us to resolve these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation. In addition, we could be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes or to modify community development plans, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nMost of our potential homebuyers engage local real estate agents who are unaffiliated with us in connection with their search for a new home. If we do not maintain good relations with, and a good reputation among, these real estate agents, the agents may not encourage potential homebuyers to consider, or may actively discourage homebuyers from considering, our communities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe use information technology and other computer resources to carry out operational and marketing activities, as well as to maintain our business records. As part of our normal business activities, we may collect and store certain confidential information, including information about employees, homebuyers, customers, vendors and suppliers and may share information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business. Many of these resources are provided to us and/or maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify certain security and service level standards. Our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if these resources are compromised, degraded, damaged or fail, whether due to a virus or other harmful circumstance, intentional penetration or disruption of our information technology resources by a third-party, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption or failure or error (including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions (including the failure to follow our security protocols) or lost connectivity to networked resources.\nThere has been an increase in cyber-attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Breaches of our data security systems, including by cyber-attacks, could result in the unintended public disclosure or the misappropriation of our proprietary information or personal and confidential information, about our employees, consumers who view our homes, homebuyers or business partners, requiring us to incur significant expense to address and resolve such issues. The release of confidential\ninformation may also lead to identity theft and related fraud, litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals and/or business partners and/or regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, and any significant disruption of our business could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation and cause us to lose homebuyers, customers, sales and revenue. We maintain insurance coverage for potential breaches but the costs to remedy a breach may not be fully covered by our insurance. We provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats and utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems, and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data. We use various encryption, tokenization and authentication technologies to mitigate cybersecurity risks and have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential cyber threats.\nProduct liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high. This coverage may be restricted and become more costly in the future. If the limits or coverages of our current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or we are not able to obtain adequate, or reasonably priced, insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, we may experience losses that could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, so our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate.\nThe homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly results of operations and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes five to nine months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders convert to home deliveries. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occurs during the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although we may also be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.\nAdditionally, weather-related problems may occur, delaying starts or closings or increasing costs and reducing profitability. In addition, delays in opening new communities or new sections of existing communities could have an adverse impact on home sales and revenues. Expenses are not incurred and recognized evenly throughout the year. Because of these factors, our quarterly results of operations may be uneven and may be marked by lower revenues and earnings in some quarters compared with others.\nShortages or extreme fluctuation in availability of natural resources and utilities could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe markets in which we operate may in the future be subject to utility or other resource shortages, including significant changes to the availability of electricity and water. Shortages of natural resources in our markets, particularly of water, may make it more difficult for us to obtain regulatory approval of new developments. We may experience material fluctuations in utility and resource costs across our markets, and we may incur additional costs and may not be able to complete construction on a timely basis if such fluctuations arise. Furthermore, these shortages and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate, which may reduce demand for our homes, lots and construction loans and negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by the failure of persons who act on our behalf to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines.\nAlthough we expect all of our employees, officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, there may be instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business engage in practices that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines. Should we learn of practices relating to homes we build, lots we develop or financing we provide that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we would move actively to stop the non-complying practices as soon as possible and would take disciplinary action with regard to employees who were aware of the practices and did not take steps to address them, including in some instances terminating their employment. However, regardless of the steps we take after we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we can in some instances be subject to fines or other governmental penalties, and our reputation can be injured, due to the practices having taken place.\nWe may suffer uninsured losses or suffer material losses in excess of insurance limits.\nWe could suffer physical damage to property or incur liabilities resulting in losses that may not be fully recoverable by insurance. In addition, certain types of risks, such as personal injury claims, may be, or may become in the future, either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may not be currently or in the future covered by our insurance policies or otherwise be subject to significant deductibles or limits. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur or be subject to deductibles, we could sustain financial loss or lose capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future income from that property. In addition, we could be liable to repair damage or meet liabilities caused by risks that are uninsured or subject to deductibles. We may be liable for any debt or other financial obligations related to affected property. Material losses or liabilities in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future.\nProducts supplied to us and work done by subcontractors can expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes, and, in some cases, to select and obtain building materials. Despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures, in some cases, subcontractors may use improper construction processes or defective materials. Defective products widely used by the homebuilding industry can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of homes. The cost of complying with our warranty obligations may be significant if we are unable to recover the cost of repairs from subcontractors, materials suppliers and insurers.\nLaws and regulations governing the residential mortgage industry could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn 2018 and 2020, we established joint ventures, Green Brick Mortgage and BHome Mortage, respectively, to provide mortgage related services to homebuyers. The residential mortgage lending industry remains under intense scrutiny and is heavily regulated at the federal, state and local levels. Although we do not originate mortgages, we are directly or indirectly subject to certain of these regulations. Changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations could require our joint venture to incur significant compliance costs. A material failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in the loss or suspension of required licenses or other approvals, the imposition of monetary penalties, and restitution awards or other relief. Any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financing and Capital Structure\nChanges in the method pursuant to which LIBOR rates are determined and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.\nThe United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) has announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 (the \u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Following the implementation of any reforms to LIBOR or the methods pursuant to which LIBOR rates are determined, or other benchmark rates that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, the manner of administration of such benchmarks may change, with the result that such benchmarks may perform differently than in the past, such benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. Under our Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, LIBOR may be used to set the fluctuating interest rate (the \u201cBase Rate\u201d) and the interest rate for any Eurodollar Rate Advance. If LIBOR is phased out, we may be required to renegotiate with our lender to establish a new interest rate (the \u201cLIBOR Successor Rate\u201d). We can give no assurance that we and our lender will be able to agree on a LIBOR Successor Rate. If we and our lender cannot agree on a LIBOR Successor Rate, our ability to draw upon the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility may be materially impacted.\nWe may be unable to obtain suitable bonding for the development of our housing projects.\nWe are periodically required to provide bonds to governmental authorities and others to ensure the completion of our projects. Depending on market conditions, surety providers may be reluctant to issue new bonds and may request credit enhancements (such as cash deposits or letters of credit) in order to maintain existing bonds or to issue new bonds. If we are unable to obtain required bonds for our future projects, or if we are required to provide credit enhancements with respect to our current or future bonds, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDifficulty in obtaining sufficient capital could result in an inability to acquire land for our developments or increased costs and delays in the completion of development projects.\nThe homebuilding industry is capital-intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land parcels and begin development. Land acquisition, development and construction activities may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of financing or the unwillingness of third parties to engage in partnerships, joint ventures or other alternative arrangements.\nIn addition to the financing provided by the senior unsecured notes, we currently have access to a senior secured revolving credit facility and a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We cannot ensure that we will be able to extend the maturity of these credit facilities or arrange another facility on acceptable terms or at all.\nFurthermore, in the future, we may seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources, including additional bank financings and/or securities offerings. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for land acquisition and construction financing, may be greatly reduced nationally, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. The credit and capital markets are subject to volatility. If we are required to seek additional financing to fund our operations, volatility in these markets may restrict our flexibility to access such financing. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures, we may be unable to acquire land for our housing developments and/or to develop the housing. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital for planned development expenditures could also cause project delays and any such delay could result in cost increases. Any one or more of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur debt instruments contain limitations and restrictions that could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and could adversely affect our growth.\nOur revolving credit facilities and the terms of our senior unsecured notes impose certain restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 operations and activities and require us to maintain certain financial covenants. The most significant restrictions relate to debt incurrence (including non-recourse indebtedness), creation of liens, repayment of certain indebtedness prior to its respective stated maturity, sales of assets, cash distributions (including paying dividends), capital stock repurchases, and investments by us and certain of our subsidiaries. These restrictions may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and could adversely affect our growth.\nThe restrictions in our debt instruments could prohibit or restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 activities, such as undertaking capital raising or restructuring activities or entering into other transactions. In addition, if we fail to comply with these restrictions, an event of default could occur and our debt under these debt instruments could become due and payable prior to maturity. Any such event of default could lead to cross defaults under certain of our other debt or negatively impact other covenants. In any of these situations, we may be unable to amend the applicable instrument or obtain a waiver without significant additional cost, or at all. Any such situation could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to future fluctuations in response to a number of factors beyond our control. In recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company or its performance, and those fluctuations could materially reduce our common stock price. If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and our stock price.\nCertain large stockholders own a significant percentage of our shares and exert significant influence over us. Their interests may not coincide with ours and they may make decisions with which we may disagree.\nGreenlight Capital, Inc. and its affiliates (\u201cGreenlight\u201d) and James R. Brickman own approximately 34% and 4%, respectively, of the voting power of the Company. These large stockholders, acting together, could determine substantially all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a sale or other change of control transaction. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change\nin control of our company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, these stockholders could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that you would not approve or make decisions with which you may disagree.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid any dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends or contained in our financing instruments and other considerations that the Board deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nCertain large stockholders\u2019 shares have been and may in the future be sold into the market, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly.\nWe believe that a significant portion of our common stock beneficially owned by Greenlight and Mr. Brickman are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws. We entered into registration rights agreements with each of these parties in 2014 which provide these parties the right to require us to register the resale of their shares under certain circumstances. In December 2020, 24,118,668 shares held by Greenlight were registered for resale on Form S-3 in accordance with the registration rights agreement. Following the recent offering, Greenlight beneficially owned 17,418,668 shares of our common stock. After a customary lockup period expires, these shares may be sold in the market, subject to compliance with securities laws. If these holders sell substantial amounts of these shares, the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.", "PERMNO": 92089, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "GRBK"}
