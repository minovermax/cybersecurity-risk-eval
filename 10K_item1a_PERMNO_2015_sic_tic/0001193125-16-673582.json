Risk Factors.\nInvestors or potential investors should carefully consider the risks described below. Additional risks of which the Corporation is presently unaware or that the Corporation considers immaterial may also impair business operations and hinder financial performance.\nIncurrence of Net Losses\nDue to negative economic conditions that impacted the manufactured housing, modular housing and recreational vehicle industries, the Corporation incurred net losses from fiscal years 2008 to 2015. Losses in future years could negatively affect the Corporation\u2019s liquidity.\nChanging Consumer Preferences\nChanges in consumer preferences for manufactured housing, modular housing and park models occur over time, and consequently the Corporation responds to changing demand by evaluating the market acceptability of its products. Delays in responding to changing consumer preferences could have an adverse effect on net sales, operating results and cash flows.\nDependence on Independent Dealers\nThe Corporation sells its manufactured homes, modular homes and park models to independent dealers. These dealers are not obligated to exclusively sell the Corporation\u2019s products, and may choose to sell competitor\u2019s products. In addition, a dealer may become financially insolvent and be forced to close its business. Both scenarios could have an adverse effect on net sales, operating results and cash flows.\nCost and Availability of Raw Materials\nPrices and availability of raw materials used to manufacture the Corporation\u2019s products can change significantly due to fluctuations in supply and demand. In addition, the cost of raw materials is also influenced by transportation costs. The Corporation has historically been able to have an adequate supply of raw materials by maintaining good relations with its vendors. Increased prices have historically been passed on to dealers by raising the price of manufactured housing, modular housing and park models. There is no certainty that the Corporation will be able to pass on future price increases and maintain an adequate supply of raw materials. The inability to raise the price of its products and to maintain a proper supply of materials could have a negative impact on net sales, operating results and cash flows.\nDealer Inventories\nAs wholesale shipments of manufactured homes, modular homes and park models exceed retail sales, dealer inventories reach a level where dealers decrease orders from manufacturers. As manufacturers respond to reduced demand, many either offer discounts to maintain production volumes or curtail production levels. Both outcomes could have a negative impact on net sales, operating results and cash flows.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors. - (Continued).\nCompetition\nAs noted in Item 1, the manufactured housing, modular housing and park model industries are highly competitive with particular emphasis on price and features offered. Some of the Corporation\u2019s competitors are vertically integrated by owning retail, consumer finance and insurance operations. This integration may provide competitors with an advantage with dealers. In addition, the Corporation\u2019s housing products compete with other forms of housing, such as new and existing site-built homes, apartments, condominiums and townhouses. The inability to effectively compete in this environment could result in lower net sales, operating results and cash flows.\nRetail Financing Availability\nCustomers who purchase the Corporation\u2019s products generally obtain retail financing from third party lenders. The availability, terms and cost of retail financing depend on the lending practices of financial institutions, governmental policies and economic and other conditions, all of which are beyond the Corporation\u2019s control. A customer seeking to purchase a manufactured home without land will generally pay a higher interest rate and have a shorter loan maturity versus a customer financing the purchase of land and a home. This difference is due to most states classifying home-only manufactured housing loans as personal property rather than real property for purposes of taxation and lien perfection.\nIn past years, many lenders of home-only financing have tightened credit underwriting standards, with some deciding to exit the industry. These actions resulted in decreased availability of retail financing, causing a negative effect on sales and operating results. If retail financing were to be further curtailed, net sales, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWholesale Financing Availability\nIndependent dealers of the Corporation\u2019s products generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesale floor plan financing provided by lending institutions. A dealer\u2019s ability to obtain financing is significantly affected by the number of lending institutions offering floor planning, and by an institution\u2019s lending limits. In past years, the industries in which the Corporation operates experienced a reduction in both the number of lenders offering floor planning and the amount of money available for financing. Any further decline in wholesale financing could have a negative impact on a dealer\u2019s ability to purchase manufactured housing, modular housing and park model products, resulting in lower net sales, operating results and cash flows.\nGovernmental Regulations\nAs noted in Item 1, the Corporation is subject to various governmental regulations. Implementation of new regulations or amendments to existing regulations could significantly increase the cost of the Corporation\u2019s products. In addition, failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines or potential civil or criminal liability. Both scenarios could negatively impact net sales, operating results and cash flows.\nContingent Repurchase Agreements\nAs referenced in Note 11 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, the Corporation is contingently liable under repurchase agreements with certain financial institutions providing inventory financing for retailers of its products. The Corporation could be required to fulfill some or all of the repurchase agreements, resulting in increased expense and reduced cash flows.\nCyclical and Seasonal Nature of Business\nThe industries in which the Corporation operates are highly cyclical, and are impacted by but not limited to the following conditions:\n\u2022\nAvailability of wholesale and retail financing;\n\u2022\nConsumer confidence;\n\u2022\nInterest rates;\nItem 1A. Risk Factors. - (Continued).\nCyclical and Seasonal Nature of Business - (Continued)\n\u2022\nDemographic and employment trends;\n\u2022\nAvailability of used or repossessed homes or park model; and\n\u2022\nImpact of inflation.\nSales associated with the manufactured housing, modular housing and park model industries are also seasonal in nature with sales being lowest in the winter months. Seasonal changes, in addition to weakness in demand in one or both of the Corporation\u2019s market segments, could materially impact the Corporation\u2019s net sales, operating results and cash flows.\nDependence on Executive Officers and Other Key Personnel\nThe Corporation depends on the efforts of its executive officers and certain key employees. An unexpected loss of the service of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on net sales, operating results and cash flows of the Corporation.\nCovenant Compliance\nThe Corporation\u2019s secured revolving credit facility necessitates compliance with various financial covenants. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Corporation on two occasions did not meet a covenant requiring a monthly loss not exceeding $500,000. A waiver of the covenant defaults was obtained in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The inability to meet covenants in the future represents an event of default, which if not cured or waived could negatively affect the Corporation\u2019s ability to obtain financing under the facility and thereby have an adverse effect on liquidity.", "PERMNO": 38850, "SIC": 2451, "TIC": "SKY"}
