{"cik": "813298", "company": "DESTINATION XL GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion identifies certain important factors that could affect our financial position, our actual results of operations and our actions and could cause our financial position, results of operations and our actions to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of our Company. Other factors, which are not identified herein, could also have such an effect.\nThe following risk factors are all of the important factors of which we are aware that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. We operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results, performance or achievements. We cannot assure you that our projected results or events will be achieved or will occur.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Industry\nWe may not be successful in executing our DXL strategy and growing our market share.\nWe are currently implementing our strategic plan to open 230 DXL stores by the end of fiscal 2017 while simultaneously closing a significant number of our Casual Male XL retail stores and Rochester Clothing stores. However, for us to be successful in the future and maintain growth, we must be able to continue increasing our market share within the big & tall industry. Our growth and market share are dependent on our ability to successfully execute the roll-out of our DXL store concept, convert our existing Casual Male and Rochester customers into DXL customers and continue to attract new customers. Our inability to execute successfully the following factors, among others, could prevent us from growing our market share and DXL brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position:\n\u25cf\nnegotiate favorable lease arrangements for new DXL stores;\n\u25cf\nexit existing lease agreements on favorable terms;\n\u25cf\neffectively open and close stores within established cost parameters;\n\u25cf\ncoordinate the timing of DXL store openings and Casual Male XL store closings;\n\u25cf\nhire qualified store management and store associates;\n\u25cf\ndevelop an effective marketing program to build brand and store concept awareness as well as increase store traffic;\n\u25cf\npredict and respond to fashion trends, while offering our customers a broad selection of merchandise in an extended selection of sizes;\n\u25cf\ngrow our DXL e-commerce business, benefiting our omni-channel environment;\n\u25cf\nmaintain our existing customer base as we transition them to the DXL store format;\n\u25cf\nattract and retain new target customers to our DXL concept;\n\u25cf\ncontinue to grow and then sustain dollars-per-transaction and share of wallet; and,\n\u25cf\noperate the DXL store concept at appropriate operating margins.\nOur marketing programs and success in maintaining and building our brand awareness, driving traffic and converting that traffic into an increased loyal customer base are critical to achieving successful market share growth within the big & tall industry.\nOur success in increasing our market share in the big & tall apparel business is largely dependent on building and maintaining favorable brand recognition for our DXL concept and effectively marketing our merchandise to all of our target customers in several diverse market segments so that they will become loyal shoppers who spend a greater portion of their wallet on our product offerings. In order to grow our brand recognition and our market share, we depend on the successful development of our brand through several means including television and radio advertising, advertising events, direct mail marketing, e-commerce and customer prospecting. Our business is directly impacted by the success of these efforts and those of our vendors. Future advertising efforts by us, our vendors or our other licensors, may be costly and may not result in increased market share or revenues.\nOur business is seasonal and is affected by general economic conditions.\nLike most other retail businesses, our business is seasonal. Historically, a significant portion of our operating income has been generated during our fourth quarter (November-January). In addition, similar to other retail businesses, our operations may be negatively affected by local, regional or national economic conditions, such as levels of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates and consumer confidence.\nOur business may be adversely affected by economic and political issues abroad.\nEconomic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source merchandise for our global sourcing program, as well as shipping and docking issues, could adversely impact the availability and cost of such merchandise. Disruptions in the global transportation network, such as political instability, the financial instability of our suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, labor and port strikes, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. In the event of disruptions or delays in deliveries due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect our results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. These and other issues affecting our suppliers could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nThe loss of, or disruption in, our centralized distribution center could negatively impact our business and operations.\nAll merchandise for our stores and e-commerce operations is received into our centralized distribution center in Canton, Massachusetts, where the inventory is then processed, sorted and shipped to our stores or directly to our customers. We depend in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of the distribution center. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and well-positioned to support our strategic plans, events beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events, employee matters or shipping problems, could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores or directly to our customers.\nWith all of our management information systems centralized in our corporate headquarters, any disruption or destruction of our system infrastructure would materially affect our business. This type of disaster is mitigated by our offsite storage and disaster recovery plans, but we would still incur business interruption which could impact our business for several weeks.\nAlthough we maintain business interruption and property insurance, we cannot be sure that our insurance will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us, in the event our distribution center is shut down for any reason or if we incur higher costs and longer lead times in connection with a disruption from our distribution center.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and implement our omni-channel initiatives, our market share and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOne of our strategic initiatives has been to move from being a multi-channel retailer to an omni-channel retailer. Our customer\u2019s shopping behavior continues to evolve across multiple channels and we are working to meet his needs. Our goal is to provide a seamless customer experience whether he shops at a store, on-line, or from a smartphone or other device. During fiscal 2014, with the implementation of new software, our inventory at the store level is now visible on our website and available for both web and in-store orders. We expect to continue to make similar ongoing investments in our information technology systems to support our evolving omni-channel capabilities.\nOmni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and our success depends on our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives.\nIf the implementation of our omni-channel initiatives is not successful, our systems are unable to support such initiatives, or if our competitors are more successful, our financial results and our market penetration may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on third parties for the manufacture of the merchandise we sell.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and are therefore entirely dependent on third parties for the manufacture of the merchandise we sell. Without adequate supplies of merchandise to sell to our customers in the merchandise styles and fashions demanded by our particular customer base, sales would decrease materially and our business would suffer. We are dependent on these third parties\u2019 ability to fulfill our merchandise orders and meet our delivery terms. In the event that manufacturers are unable or unwilling to ship products to us in a timely manner or continue to manufacture products for us, we would have to rely on other current manufacturing sources or identify and qualify new manufacturers. We might not be able to identify or qualify such manufacturers for existing or new products in a timely manner and such manufacturers might not allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. Our inability to secure adequate and timely supplies of private label merchandise would negatively impact proper inventory levels, sales and gross margin rates, and ultimately our results of operations.\nIn addition, even if our current manufacturers continue to manufacture our products, they may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with our standards. If we are forced to rely on manufacturers who produce products of inferior quality, then our brand recognition and customer satisfaction would likely suffer. These manufacturers may also increase the cost to us of the products we purchase from them.\nA significant portion of our merchandise is imported directly from other countries, and U.S. domestic suppliers who source their goods from other countries supply most of our remaining merchandise. In the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, we may not be able to maintain adequate inventory levels of important merchandise on a consistent basis, which would negatively impact our sales and potentially erode the confidence of our customer base, leading to further loss of sales and an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used in the manufacturing of our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin or on our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands. The prices for fabrics depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them. To the extent that we cannot offset these cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies, such higher costs will need to be passed on to our customers. Such increased costs could lead to reduced customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.\nOur success depends significantly on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain additional personnel.\nOur future success is dependent on the personal efforts, performance and abilities of our key management which includes our executive officer as well as several significant members of our senior management. For example, the loss of the services of David Levin, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is an integral part of our daily operations and is the primary decision maker in all our important operating matters, could significantly impact our business until an adequate replacement or replacements can be identified and put in place. The loss of any of our senior management may result in a loss of organizational focus, poor operating execution, an inability to identify and execute strategic initiatives, an impairment in our ability to identify new store locations, and an inability to consummate possible acquisitions.\nThe competition is intense for the type of highly skilled individuals with relevant industry experience that we require and we may not be able to attract and retain new employees of the caliber needed to achieve our objectives.\nOur business may be negatively impacted and we may be liable if third parties misappropriate proprietary information of our customers and breach our security systems.\nWe may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information. During fiscal 2014, approximately 90% of our sales were settled through credit and debit card transactions. Any security breach could expose us to risks of loss, litigation and liability and could adversely affect our operations as well as cause our shoppers to stop shopping with us as a result of their lack of confidence in the security of their personally identifiable information, which could have a negative impact on our sales and profitability. A number of retailers have experienced actual security breaches where credit and debit card information may have been stolen, including a number of highly publicized incidents with well-known retailers in late 2013. If third parties are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate the personal information or credit card information of our customers or if third parties gain unauthorized and improper access to such information, we could be subject to liability. These liabilities could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims, claims for other misuses of personal information, including unauthorized marketing purposes, and could ultimately result in litigation. Liability for misappropriation of this information could be significant.\nFurther, if a third party were to use this proprietary customer information in order to compete with us, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and could result in litigation.\nWe have been Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) compliant since 2007, which we believe is important in ensuring that our security systems are protected, but there is always a risk that protected systems can be compromised. During fiscal 2014, significant investments were made to further secure our Company\u2019s credit and debit processing environments. These included the implementation of a new store network specific firewall solution, a new malware prevention product, and a software white listing technology for additional malware protection.\nOur business is highly competitive, and competitive factors may reduce our revenues and profit margins.\nThe United States men\u2019s big & tall apparel market is highly competitive with many national and regional department stores, mass merchandisers, specialty apparel retailers and discount stores offering a broad range of apparel products similar to the products that we sell. Besides retail competitors, we consider any manufacturer of big & tall merchandise operating in outlet malls throughout the United States to be a competitor. It is also possible that another competitor, either a mass merchant or a men\u2019s specialty store or specialty apparel catalog, could gain market share in men\u2019s big & tall apparel due to more favorable pricing, locations, brand and fashion assortment and size availability. Many of our competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. The presence in the marketplace of various fashion trends and the limited availability of shelf space also can affect competition. We may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors in the future and could lose brand recognition and market share. A significant loss of market share would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to predict fashion trends and customer preferences successfully.\nCustomer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and tend to change rapidly. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to predict effectively and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer demands and to translate market trends to appropriate saleable product offerings. If we are unable to predict or respond to changing styles or trends successfully and misjudge the market for products or any new product lines, our sales will be impacted and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. In response, we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which would decrease our revenues and margins. In addition, the failure to satisfy consumer demand, specifically in our DXL stores and website, could have serious longer-term consequences, such as an adverse impact on our brand value and the loss of market share to our competitors.\nThe loss of any of our key trademarks or licenses could adversely affect demand for our products.\nWe own and use a number of trademarks and operate under several trademark license agreements. We believe that certain of these trademarks have significant value and are instrumental in our ability to create and sustain demand for and to market our products. We cannot be certain that these trademarks and licensing agreements will remain in effect and enforceable or that any license agreements, upon expiration, can be renewed on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, any future disputes concerning these trademarks and licenses may cause us to incur significant litigation costs or force us to suspend use of the disputed trademarks.\nThe re-occurrence of any disruption to the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, or those of our customers and vendors.\nThe re-occurrence of any disruption to the capital and credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, or those of our customers and vendors. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity. Such disruptions may also adversely impact the capital needs of our customers and vendors, which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nActs of terrorism or a catastrophic event could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nUnforeseen events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our vendors and other suppliers, or result in political or economic instability.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and heightened security measures in response to an act of terrorism may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence which could negatively impact our sales by causing consumer spending to decline. Furthermore, an act of terrorism or war, or the threat thereof, could negatively impact our business by interfering with our ability to obtain merchandise from vendors or substitute suppliers at similar costs in a timely manner.\nFailure to comply with laws, rules and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance.\nOur business is subject to federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations, such as state and local wage and hour laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the False Claims Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), securities laws, import and export laws (including customs regulations), privacy and information security regulations, unclaimed property laws, the Affordable Care Act and many others. The effect of some of these laws and regulations may be to increase the cost of doing business and may have a material impact on our earnings. In addition, the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to legal and regulatory requirements and increased enforcement. In addition, as a result of operating in the U.K., we must comply with that country\u2019s laws and regulations, which may differ substantially from, and may conflict with, corresponding U.S. laws and regulations. We may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies, which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry, country or practice. If we fail to comply with laws, rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, we may be subject to government enforcement action, class action litigation or other litigation, damage to our reputation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, and increased cost of regulatory compliance, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile due to many factors.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may increase or decrease rapidly in the future depending on news announcements and changes in general market conditions. Since January 1, 2003, the closing price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $0.26 per share (March 3, 2009) to a high of $14.95 per share (October 26, 2006). The following factors, among others, may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price:\n\u25cf\noverall changes in the economy and general market volatility;\n\u25cf\nnews announcements regarding our quarterly or annual results of operations;\n\u25cf\nquarterly comparable sales;\n\u25cf\nacquisitions;\n\u25cf\ncompetitive developments;\n\u25cf\nlitigation affecting us; or\n\u25cf\nmarket views as to the prospects of the retail industry generally.\nRights of our stockholders may be negatively affected if we issue any of the shares of preferred stock which our Board of Directors has authorized for issuance.\nWe have available for issuance up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue any or all of these shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without any further action on the part of stockholders. The rights of our stockholders may be negatively affected if we issue a series of preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or distribution upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nIn addition, the issuance of preferred stock by our Board of Directors pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, as amended, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of the outstanding voting stock of our Company.\nState laws and our certificate of incorporation, as amended, may inhibit potential acquisition bids that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe are subject to certain provisions of Delaware law, which could also delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. In particular, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in certain business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless specific conditions are met. In addition, certain provisions of Delaware law could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including, without limitation, discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock. The provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation, as amended, contains provisions that restrict any person or entity from attempting to transfer our stock, without prior permission from the Board of Directors, to the extent that such transfer would (i) create or result in an individual or entity becoming a five-percent shareholder of our stock, or (ii) increase the stock ownership percentage of any existing five-percent shareholder. These provisions provide that any transfer that violates such provisions shall be null and void and would require the purported transferee to, upon demand by us, transfer the shares that exceed the five percent limit to an agent designated by us for the purpose of conducting a sale of such excess shares. These provisions would make the acquisition of our Company more expensive to the acquirer and could significantly delay, discourage, or prevent third parties from acquiring our Company without the approval of our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 11379, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "DXLG"}
