{"cik": "1578776", "company": "PRUDENTIAL BANCORP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-12-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn analyzing whether to make or to continue on investment in our securities, investors should consider, among other factors, the following risk factors.\nOur non-performing assets expose us to increased risk of loss\nAt September 30, 2017, we had total non-performing assets of $15.6 million, or 1.70% of total assets as compared to $16.5 million or 2.94% of total assets as of September 30, 2016. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not accrue interest income on non-accrual loans and no interest income is recognized until the loan is performing and the financial condition of the borrower supports recording interest income on a cash basis. We must reserve for probable losses, which are established through a current period charge to income in the provision for loan losses, and from time to time, write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract us from the overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities of Prudential Savings. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inaccurate, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly. At September 30, 2017, our allowance for loan losses amounted to $4.5 million, or 0.8% of total loans and 29.0% of non-performing loans, compared to $3.3 million, or 0.9% of total loans and 20.6% of non-performing loans at September 30, 2016.\nHigher loan losses could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings\nWhen we loan money we incur the risk that our borrowers will not repay their loans. We reserve for loan losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, borrowers with adjustable-rate loans could see their payments increase. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to pay their loans, resulting in our charging off more loans and increasing our allowance. In addition, when real estate values decline, the potential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios. The continued weakness in the national economy and the economies of the areas in which our loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or repossessions, resulting in the increased charge-off amounts and the need for additional loan loss provisions in future periods. In addition, our determination as to the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by our primary banking regulators, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as part of their examination process, which may result in the establishment of an additional provision based upon the judgment of such agencies after a review of the information available at the time of its examination. Our allowance for loan losses amounted to 0.8% of total loans and 29.0% of non-performing loans at September 30, 2017. Our allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2017 may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require an increased provision to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect earnings.\nOur existing residential mortgage loans exposes us to lending risks, and the geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy.\nAt September 30, 2017, $351.3 million, or 53.8 % of our loan portfolio, was secured by one-to-four family real estate. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. The decline in residential real estate values as a result of the downturn in our local housing market that occurred in recent years in many cases reduced the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages loans to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral. Real estate values are affected by various factors, including supply and demand, changes in general or regional economic conditions, interest rates, governmental rules or policies and natural disasters. Future weakness in economic conditions also could result in reduced loan demand and a decline in loan originations. In particular, a significant decline in real estate values would likely lead to a decrease in new construction, commercial real estate and residential mortgage loan originations and increased delinquencies and defaults in our real estate loan portfolio.\nOur increased emphasis on originating construction and commercial real estate loans may expose us to increased lending risks.\nAt September 30, 2017, $145.5 million, or 22.3%, of our loan portfolio consisted of construction loans, including loans for the acquisition and development of property, and $127.6 million, or 19.6%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied residential real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction compared to the estimated costs, including interest, of construction and other assumptions. Additionally, if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted with a project, when completed, having a value less than the loan amount. We have attempted to minimize these risks by generally concentrating on residential construction loans in our market area to contractors with whom we have established lending relationships and by selling, with respect to larger construction and land development loans, participation interests in order to reduce our exposure. Likewise, commercial real estate loans generally expose a lender to a greater risk of loss than one-to-four family residential loans. Repayment of commercial real estate loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property or business to cover operating expenses and debt service. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Changes in economic conditions that are out of the control of the borrower and lender could impact the value of the security for the loan, the future cash flow of the involved property, or the marketability of a construction project with respect to loans originated for the acquisition and development of property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced with respect to commercial real estate properties than residential properties. Also, many of construction borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan.\nIn recent periods, the majority of our non-performing assets have related to construction loans. At September 30, 2017, five construction loans aggregating $8.7 million were considered non-performing and on non-accrual status. All of these construction loans were related to a loan relationship consisting of nine loans with a total principal balance outstanding of $10.7 million, all of which was deemed non-performing as of such date. In addition, non-performing assets at September 30, 2017 included 33 one-to-four family loans aggregating $3.7 million, five commercial real estate loans aggregating $1.6 million and one single-family residential loan aggregating $1.4 million related to the same borrower.\nImposition of limits by the bank regulators on commercial and multi-family real estate lending activities could curtail our growth and adversely affect our earnings.\nIn 2006, the FDIC, the FRB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d (the \u201cCRE Guidance\u201d). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure could receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of commercial real estate and multi-family loans represents 220.2% of the Bank\u2019s total risk-based capital at September 30, 2017.\nIn December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the \u201c2015 Statement\u201d). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies, among other things, indicate the intent to continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the FDIC, our primary federal regulator, were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, for reasons noted above or otherwise, our earnings would be adversely affected.\nWe have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate in our market area; adverse economic conditions in our market area have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our financial condition and result of operations\nSubstantially all of our loans are to individuals, businesses and real estate developers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Delaware and our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in these market areas. Severe declines in housing prices and property values have been particularly acute in our primary market areas in recent years. A deterioration in economic conditions or a prolonged weakness in the economic recovery in our primary market areas could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business:\n\u2022 Loan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022 Problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022 Demand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022 The carrying value of our other real estate owned may decline further; and\n\u2022 Collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may continue to decline in value, in turn reducing a customer\u2019s borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans.\nThe Company\u2019s credit standards and its on-going credit assessment processes might not protect it from significant credit losses.\nThe Company assumes credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. We manage our credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions and a continuous quality assessment process of credit already extended. Our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize local lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. The Company\u2019s credit administration function employs risk management techniques to help ensure that problem loans and leases are promptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide us with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary and to take appropriate corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk.\nA significant percentage of our assets is invested in securities which typically have a lower yield than our loan portfolio.\nOur results of operations are substantially dependent on our net interest income. At September 30, 2017, $269.2 million or 29.9 % of our assets was invested in investment securities, certificates of deposit, cash and amounts due from banks. These investments yield substantially less than the loans we hold in our portfolio. The weighted average yield on such assets for the year ended September 30, 2017 was 2.67% as compared to 4.12% for loans. Accordingly, our net interest margin is lower than it would have been if a higher proportion of our interest-earning assets consisted of loans. In addition, at September 30, 2017, $178.4 million, or 74.4% of our investment securities, are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income, which affects our reported equity. Accordingly, given the material size of the investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale and due to possible mark-to-market adjustments of that portion of the portfolio resulting from market conditions, we may experience greater volatility in the value of reported equity. Moreover, given that we actively manage our investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale, we may sell securities which could result in a realized loss, thereby reducing our net income.\nWhile we intend to invest a greater proportion of our assets in loans with the goal of increasing our net interest income, we may not be able to increase originations of loans that are acceptable to us.\nOur success depends on hiring and retaining certain key personnel.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as loan and deposit generation, as well as operational functions such as regulatory compliance and information technology. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could cause a decrease in our net income. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nHigher interest rates would hurt our profitability\nManagement is unable to predict fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many factors, including inflation, recession, unemployment, monetary policy, domestic and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets, and investor and consumer demand. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of single-family residential loans) and the interest expense generated by our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (the \u201cFOMC\u201d), and market interest rates. The FOMC raised the federal funds rate twice to date in 2017 and may implement an additional increase as of the end of December 2017.\nA sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings. A significant portion of our loans have fixed interest rates (or, if adjustable, are initially fixed for periods of five to 10 years) and longer terms than our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates we earn on loans. As a result of our historical focus on the origination of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, which focus has been emphasized in recent years due to asset quality issues experienced by our construction and land development lending activities, the majority of our loans have fixed interest rates. In addition, a large percentage of our investment securities and mortgage-backed securities have fixed interest rates and are classified as held to maturity. As is the case with many banks and savings institutions, our emphasis on increasing the development of core deposits, those with no stated maturity date, has resulted in our interest-bearing liabilities having a shorter duration than our assets. As of September 30, 2017, 41.7% of our loan portfolio had maturities of 10 years or more. Furthermore, at such date, only $91.8 million or 14.1% of the loans due after September 30, 2017 bear adjustable interest rates. At September 30, 2017, 38.0% of our deposits had no stated maturity date and 37.1% consisted of certificates of deposit with maturities of one year or less. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because interest rates change over time and are currently at historical low levels. As interest rates increase, our cost of funds will increase more rapidly than the yields on the bulk of our interest-earning assets. In addition, the market value of our fixed-rate assets for example, our investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolios, would decline if interest rates increase. For example, we estimate that as of September 30, 2017, a 200 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in our net portfolio value declining by approximately $34.1 million or 2.6%. Net portfolio value is the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nThe Company and Prudential Savings are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of insurance funds and the depositors and borrowers of Prudential Savings rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firms. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of our operations as could our interpretation of those changes.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is significantly changing the current bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \"unfair, deceptive or abusive\" acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks with $10 billion or less in assets continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk-based capital requirements for bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks, which could limit our ability to borrow at the holding company level and invest the proceeds from such borrowings as capital in Prudential Savings Bank, and will exclude certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as Tier 1 capital, such as trust preferred securities.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business will not be known until all of the regulations implementing the statute are adopted and implemented. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act will impact our business, operations or financial condition. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may require us to make changes to our business and operations and will likely result in additional costs and divert management\u2019s time from other business activities, any of which may adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nHowever, in February 2017, the President issued an executive order that a policy of his administration would be making regulation efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored, and directed certain regulatory agencies to review and identify laws and regulations that inhibit federal regulation of the U.S. financial system in a manner consistent with the policies stated in the executive order. Any changes in laws or regulation as a result of this review could result in a repeal, amendment to or delayed implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nThe Bank has deferred tax assets totaling $4.1 mil and any future reduction in the federal statutory tax rate could also cause a reduction in the economic benefit of the net operating loss and other deferred tax assets available to us and a corresponding charge to reduce the book value of the deferred tax asset recorded on our balance sheet. The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have each passed tax reform legislation which, if enacted, would reduce the corporate income tax rate to 20%, from a current rate of 35%. At September 30, 2017, we had deferred tax assets with a net book value of $86.2 million, based on a federal tax rate of 35%. If the federal statutory corporate income tax rate is reduced to 20%, this asset will be revalued at the lower rate, resulting in a charge to income tax expense and a corresponding reduction in deferred tax assets.\nWe have become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, the federal banking agencies approved a new rule that has substantially amended regulatory risk-based capital rules. The final rule implements the regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel III\u201d) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which were effective for us on January 1, 2016, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from prior rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings to be included for calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. Prudential Savings elected to opt out of the requirement under the final rule to include certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings for calculating its regulatory capital requirements. The final rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and, when fully phased in, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased-in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nWe have analyzed the effects of these new capital requirements on a fully phased-in basis, and we believe that we meet all of these new requirements, including the full 2.5% capital conservation buffer, as if these new requirements had been in effect as of September 30, 2017.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy, and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or repurchasing shares. Specifically, beginning in 2017, Prudential Savings ability to pay dividends is limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the new capital rules, which may further limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders.\nProposed and final regulations could restrict our ability to originate and sell loans.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u2022 excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u2022 interest-only payments;\n\u2022 negative amortization; and\n\u2022 terms of longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a loan must be made to a borrower whose total monthly debt-to-income ratio does not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower on the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the regulatory agencies to issue regulations that require securitizes of loans to retain \u201cnot less than 5% of the credit risk for any asset that is not a qualified residential mortgage.\u201d The regulatory agencies have issued a final rule to implement this requirement. The final rule provides that the definition of \u201cqualified residential mortgage\u201d includes loans that meet the definition of qualified mortgage issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nThe final rule could have a significant effect on the secondary market for loans and the types of loans we originate, and restrict our ability to make loans. Similarly, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, which could limit our growth or profitability.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our current market and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth\nWe face intense competition in making loans, attracting deposits and hiring and retaining experienced employees. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and attract deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits sometimes results in us charging lower interest rates on our loans and paying higher interest rates on our deposits, which reduces our net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions outside of our control\nAs of September 30, 2017, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was approximately $238.6 million. We have historically taken a conservative investment strategy, with concentrations of securities that are backed by government sponsored enterprises. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\nIf the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in the Company\u2019s financial reporting, which could harm its business and the trading price of its common stock.\nThe Company has established a process to document and evaluate its internal controls over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations, which require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting. In this regard, management has, among other things, dedicated internal resources and engaged outside consultants to (i) assess and document the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting, (ii) take steps to improve control processes, where appropriate, (iii) validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and (iv) implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Although the Company\u2019s management and audit committee believe that its system of internal controls is effective, the Company cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that the Company implements and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm the Company\u2019s operating results or cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations. If the Company fails to correct any issues in the design or operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, or fails to prevent fraud, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in the Company\u2019s financial reporting, which could harm its business and the trading price of its common stock.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders.\nThe Company is exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from its actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect its ability to attract and keep customers and can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. The Company\u2019s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. The Company also may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. The Company is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as the Company is) and to the risk that its (or its vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability of the Company to operate its business, potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide key components of its business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s business infrastructure, for example, system support and network access. While the Company has selected these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from their failure to provide services for any reason or their poor performance of services, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nThe Company\u2019s operations may be adversely affected by cyber security risks.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in systems and on networks. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to operations and our business strategy. The Company has invested in accepted technologies, and continually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect our networks, computers and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure or those of third parties used by us to compile, process or store such information may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged or disclosed. A breach in security could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to successfully compete may be reduced if we are unable to make technological advances.\nThe banking industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology. In addition to improving customer services, effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. As a result, our future success will depend in part on our ability to address our customers\u2019 needs by using technology. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively develop new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products to our customers. Many of our competitors have far greater resources than we have to invest in technology.\nWe expect that implementation of a new accounting standard could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Bank for our first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which we expect may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal Reserve Board policy could limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. These regulatory policies could affect our ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nThe integration of Polonia Bancorp as a result of its merger with the Company may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected.\nPrudential Bancorp and Polonia Bancorp historically operated until the effective time of the merger on January 1, 2017, independently. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine the businesses of Prudential Bancorp and Polonia Bancorp. Prudential Bancorp is integrating Polonia\u2019s business into its own. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to successfully conduct its business in the markets in which Polonia Bancorp previously operated, which could have an adverse effect on Prudential Bancorp\u2019s financial results and the value of its common stock. If Prudential Bancorp experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause the Company to lose current customers or cause customers of Polonia Bancorp to remove their accounts from Polonia Bancorp or Prudential Bancorp and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company for an undetermined period after consummation of the merger.\nPrudential Bancorp may fail to fully realize the cost savings estimated for the merger with Polonia Bancorp.\nPrudential Bancorp estimates that it will achieve cost savings from the merger when the two companies have been fully integrated. While the Company continues to be comfortable with these expectations as of the date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2017, it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be incorrect.\nThe actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what Prudential Bancorp expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If the Company is not able to adequately address integration challenges, Prudential Bancorp may be unable to successfully integrate the Company\u2019s and Polonia Bancorp\u2019s operations or to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies.", "PERMNO": 90637, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "PBIP"}
