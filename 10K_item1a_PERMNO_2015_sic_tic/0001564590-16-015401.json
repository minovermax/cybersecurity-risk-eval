You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have concluded that due to our need for additional capital, and the uncertainties surrounding our ability to raise such funding, substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred significant losses from operations since our inception and expect losses to continue for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.8 million and a working capital deficiency of $47.2 million. We believe that, based on our cash and cash equivalent balances at December 31, 2015, the additional $1.0 million drawn in March 2016 under the Ferrer Note and our expected cash usage, we have sufficient capital resources to meet our anticipated cash needs until the end of April 2016. We have incurred significant losses from operations since our inception and expect losses to continue for the foreseeable future. In light of our ongoing costs and product candidate development, and our projected working capital needs, we expect to need to source additional capital to finance our ongoing operations in the next twelve months. We may not be able to source sufficient capital on acceptable terms, or at all, to continue to pursue approval to commercialize ADASUVE in the United States or other countries, to continue development of our other product candidates or to continue operations. We plan to source additional capital which may be used to fund strategic initiatives, operations and working capital, or development of product candidates. In addition to product revenues, royalties and milestone payments, we may finance our operations through additional distribution or licensing collaborations, sale of equity securities, or utilization of debt arrangements. Such funding may not be available or may be on terms that are not favorable to us. Our inability to source capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives. Even if we are able to source additional capital, we may be forced to significantly reduce our operations if our business prospects do not improve. If we are unable to source additional capital, we may be forced to shut down operations altogether.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Letter of Intent with Ferrer with respect to the Transaction. The Letter of Intent does not constitute a binding agreement to consummate such acquisition and it entitles both us and Ferrer to terminate discussions at any time in our or Ferrer's sole discretion. Additionally we can, at our discretion, enter into discussions with third parties and continue to explore strategic options. We continue to have discussions with Ferrer regarding a transaction. There can be no assurance that such potential transaction will be agreed to or consummated and you should not acquire any shares of our common stock in reliance on our consummation of the Transaction. Additionally, if we are unable to complete the Transaction, we will likely need to source additional financing to fund our operations.\nOur audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that we will continue in operation for the next twelve months and will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from our inability to continue as a going concern. Our operating and capital plans for the next twelve months call for cash expenditure to exceed our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and working capital. We concluded that due to our need for additional capital, and the uncertainties surrounding our ability to raise such funding, substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We may be forced to reduce our operating expenses, raise additional funds, principally through the additional sales of our securities or debt financings, or enter into an additional corporate partnership to meet our working capital needs. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when\nneeded or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital or complete a strategic transaction, we may be unable to continue to fund our operations, develop our product candidates or realize value from our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and might realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment in our common stock.\nWe may not complete our proposed transaction with Ferrer and our inability to consummate the proposed transaction could harm the market price of our common stock and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is no assurance that the proposed Transaction with Ferrer will occur when and as we expect, or at all. Currently, we are party only to the non-binding Letter of Intent with respect to the proposed Transaction, and we may not be able to reach an agreement with Ferrer as to the terms of a definitive agreement. In addition, even if we do enter into a definitive agreement, the proposed Transaction may not be completed, due to a failure to satisfy required closing conditions or otherwise. If the proposed Transaction is not completed for any reason, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, failure to complete the proposed Transaction will result in a reduction in the amount of cash otherwise available to us and may limit our ability to implement our business strategy. The failure of the proposed Transaction to occur may also result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us among other potential strategic partners, as well as in the investment community generally. Finally, we are incurring expenses pursuing the proposed Transaction, and these expenses will reduce our earnings and cash flows, whether or not the proposed Transaction is completed.\nOur near-term prospects are dependent on ADASUVE. If we or our present and future collaborators are unable to successfully commercialize ADASUVE for the acute treatment of agitation in adults with schizophrenia or bipolar disease, our ability to generate significant revenue or achieve profitability will be adversely affected.\nADASUVE is our only product approved for marketing in the United States, the EU and certain Latin American countries, and our ability to generate revenue in the near term is entirely dependent upon sales of ADASUVE. We do not have any product approved for marketing outside of the United States, the EU or Latin America. We or our present and future collaborators may not be able to successfully commercialize ADASUVE for a number of reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nwe or our present and any future collaborators may not be able to establish or demonstrate in the medical community the safety and efficacy of ADASUVE and any potential advantages over existing therapeutics and products currently in clinical development;\n\u00b7\nwe do not have any current collaborator for the commercialization of ADASUVE in the U.S. and there is no guarantee that we will ever enter into a commercialization agreement with any such collaborator;\n\u00b7\ndoctors may be hesitant to prescribe ADASUVE until results from our post-approval studies are available or other long term data regarding efficacy and safety become available;\n\u00b7\nresults from our post-approval studies may fail to verify the clinical benefit of ADASUVE for the treatment of agitation in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia or may reveal unforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7\nour limited experience in marketing, selling and distributing ADASUVE;\n\u00b7\nreimbursement and coverage policies of government and private payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators;\n\u00b7\nthe relative price of ADASUVE as compared to alternative treatment options;\n\u00b7\nthe reliability of our estimates, including the frequency of agitation in many patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia;\n\u00b7\nwe or our collaborators may not have, or may not choose to dedicate, adequate financial or other resources to successfully commercialize ADASUVE; and\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to manufacture ADASUVE in commercial quantities or at acceptable costs.\nIf we or our collaborator are unable to successfully commercialize ADASUVE for the treatment of agitation in adults with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, our ability to generate revenue from royalties and product sales and achieve profitability will be adversely affected and our stock price would likely decline.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Teva Amendment to reacquire the ADASUVE U.S. commercial rights and restructure our obligations under the Teva Note. The Teva Amendment provides for (i) the transfer of the NDA and related regulatory filings for ADASUVE to us and the assumption of responsibility by us for all regulatory activities related to ADASUVE in the U.S. as soon as practicable; (ii) an exclusive license of Teva intellectual property with respect to ADASUVE, which intellectual property will be assigned to us in connection with a change of control or an exclusive license to ADASUVE in the United States to a third party; (iii) our undertaking responsibility for the REMS program, either through Teva\u2019s vendors or vendors otherwise selected by us; (iv) the transfer from Teva of existing supplies of ADASUVE as well as all commercial, medical and academic materials, documents and relationships; (v) the right of us to sell Teva-labeled product in accordance with all applicable laws and Teva policies; and (vi) the satisfaction and termination of all payment obligations of the parties with respect to the commercialization of ADASUVE except as with respect to the Amended Teva Note and our issuance of 2,172,886 shares of our common stock to Teva. We cannot be assured that we will be able to resume production to continue product availability to patients and healthcare providers in the United States after the return of the rights to us. If we are not able to continue product availability to patients and healthcare providers in the United States, we will not be able to generate any commercial revenue from ADASUVE.\nWe plan to identify a new U.S. commercial partner for ADASUVE in 2016, however, we cannot be assured that we will be successful or whether or not the terms of such collaboration would be on terms less favorable to us than those of our future collaborators.\nThere is no guarantee that even if we do engage in a strategic transaction that such strategic transaction will increase stockholder value.\nWe have engaged Guggenheim Securities, LLC to assist in exploring strategic options to enhance stockholder value, including a possible sale or disposition of one or more corporate assets, a strategic business combination, partnership or other transactions. We may never complete a strategic transaction, and in the event that we do complete a strategic transaction, implementation of such transactions may impair stockholder value or otherwise adversely affect our business. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges and may pose significant integration challenges and/or management and business disruptions, any of which could harm our results of operation, business prospects, and impair the value of any such strategic transaction to our stockholders.\nWe have a history of net losses. We expect to continue to incur substantial and increasing net losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $21.3 million, $36.7 million, and $39.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $432.0 million and a stockholders\u2019 deficit of $71.7 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial net losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future. These losses and negative operating cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the commercialization of ADASUVE by us and Ferrer, our ability to supply commercial quantities of ADASUVE, and conduct pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to predict accurately the timing or amount of future revenues or expenses, or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. In February 2016, we reacquired the U.S. rights for ADASUVE from Teva. We plan to identify a new U.S. commercial partner for ADASUVE in 2016, however, we cannot be assured that we will be successful or whether or not the terms of such collaboration would be on terms\nless favorable to us than those of our future collaborators. Even if we were to enter into such an agreement, we cannot be assured that we or a new collaborator would be able to successfully commercialize ADASUVE in the U.S.\nTo date, we have not generated any significant royalty revenue. We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, equipment financing, debt financing, collaboration and licensing agreements, and government grants. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of growth or contraction of our expenses and the level and rate of growth, if any, of our revenues. Revenues from strategic collaborations are uncertain because we may not enter into any additional strategic collaborations or our current collaboration may have different results than we anticipate. If we or our collaborator are unable to successfully commercialize ADASUVE or one or more of our product candidates or if sales revenue from ADASUVE or any product candidate that receives marketing approval is insufficient, we will not achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability.\nOur operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate. If our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our stock could decline.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. ADASUVE sales will be difficult to predict from period to period. For example, we did not have any shipments of ADASUVE in the fourth quarter of 2014 and do not anticipate any product shipments beginning in the first quarter of 2016 through at least the second quarter of 2017. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\na failure to achieve a sufficient level of demand by patients and healthcare providers for ADASUVE and our ability to enter into and maintain successful collaborations to satisfy any such demand for ADASUVE;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and level of investment in our or our collaborator\u2019s sales and marketing efforts to support ADASUVE sales;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and level of investment in our or our collaborator\u2019s research and development activities involving ADASUVE;\n\u00b7\nexpenditures we may incur to acquire or develop additional products; and\n\u00b7\nwhether we have sufficient available capital to continue operating.\nIn addition, we measure compensation cost for stock-based awards made to employees at the grant date of the award, based on the fair value of the award, and recognize the cost as an expense over the employee\u2019s requisite service period. As the variables that we use as a basis for valuing these awards change over time, including our underlying stock price, the magnitude of the expense that we must recognize may vary significantly. Any such variance from one period to the next could cause a significant fluctuation in our operating results.\nFor these reasons, it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future profits or losses. As a result, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps substantially.\nWe will need substantial additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.\nWe will need to source additional capital to fund our operations, to develop our product candidates and to support our commercial manufacturing capabilities. Our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors including:\n\u00b7\nOur success in commercializing ADASUVE in the United States or the success of any collaboration to commercialize ADASUVE in the United States;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to execute the ADASUVE REMS program to the satisfaction of the FDA;\n\u00b7\nFerrer\u2019s success in commercializing ADASUVE in the Ferrer Territories;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and success of any future licensing arrangement that we may enter into for the commercial rights for ADASUVE in the United States, outside the United States and the Ferrer Territories;\n\u00b7\nthe development costs for our other product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of complying with our post-approval commitments;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of complying with the process for renewal of marketing authorization in the EU;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, rate of progress, results and costs of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, rate of progress, results and costs of our commercial manufacturing development and commercial manufacturing activities;\n\u00b7\nour ability to execute our commercial production strategy;\n\u00b7\npayments received under our collaborations with Ferrer and any future strategic collaborations;\n\u00b7\nthe continuation of the Ferrer collaborations under their agreed terms;\n\u00b7\nthe filing, prosecution and enforcement of patent claims; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with commercializing our other product candidates, if they receive regulatory approval.\nWe believe that, based on our cash and cash equivalent balances at December 31, 2015, the additional $1.0 million drawn in March 2016 under the Ferrer Note and our expected cash usage, we have sufficient capital resources to meet our anticipated cash needs until the end of April 2016. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate, or to alter our operations. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. The key assumptions underlying these estimates include:\n\u00b7\nno unexpected costs related to the strategic transactions or any financing goals;\n\u00b7\nthe success of finding a collaborator to commercialize ADASUVE in the United States;\n\u00b7\ncontinuation of our Ferrer collaborations;\n\u00b7\nno unexpected costs related to the development of our product candidates; and\n\u00b7\nno unbudgeted growth in the number of our employees during this period.\nEven if circumstances do not cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate, we may be forced to significantly reduce our operations if our business prospects do not improve. If we are unable to source additional capital, we may be forced to shut down operations altogether.\nWe may never be able to generate a sufficient amount of product or royalty revenue to cover our expenses. We did not generate any product revenues until the second quarter of 2013 and did not generate any royalty revenues until the second quarter of 2014. We suspended our commercial production operations during the third quarter of 2015 and fulfilled our close-out orders from Teva and shipped the last order from Ferrer in October 2015. We are uncertain when we will resume production and do not anticipate any product shipments through at least the second quarter of 2017 or until we find a partnering solution in the U.S. to replace Teva. In February 2016, we entered into the Teva Amendment to reacquire the ADASUVE U.S. commercial rights for and restructure our obligations under the Teva Note. The Teva Amendment provides for (i) the transfer of the NDA and related regulatory filings for ADASUVE to us and the assumption of responsibility by us for all regulatory activities related to ADASUVE in the U.S. as soon as practicable; (ii) an exclusive license of Teva intellectual property with respect to ADASUVE, which intellectual property will be assigned to us in connection with a change of control or an exclusive license to ADASUVE in the United States to a third party; (iii) our undertaking responsibility for the REMS program, either through Teva\u2019s vendors or vendors otherwise selected by us; (iv) the transfer from Teva of existing supplies of ADASUVE as well as all commercial, medical and academic materials, documents and relationships; (v) the right of us to sell Teva-labeled product in accordance with all applicable laws and Teva policies; and (vi) the satisfaction and termination of all payment obligations of the parties with respect to the commercialization of ADASUVE except as with respect to the Amended Teva Note and our issuance of 2,172,886 shares of our common stock to Teva . If we are not able to continue product availability to patients and healthcare\nproviders in the United States, we will not be able to generate any commercial revenue from ADASUVE. In addition, in connection with a royalty securitization financing we effected in March 2014, we contributed and sold our rights to U.S. ADASUVE royalties and milestone payments to a wholly-owned subsidiary that issued $45.0 million of 12.25% senior secured notes, or the Notes. To date we have not recognized significant royalty revenues. Until we generate sufficient revenues to cover expenses, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements. Any financing transaction may contain unfavorable terms. For example, the terms of certain warrants we have issued in previous financings could require us to pay warrant holders a significant portion of the proceeds in a change of control transaction, potentially materially reducing the proceeds available to holders of our common stock. If we source additional funds by issuing equity securities our stockholders\u2019 equity will be diluted and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. If we source additional funds through strategic collaborations, we may be required to relinquish rights to ADASUVE, our product candidates or our technologies, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Complying with the terms of the foregoing rights and restrictions may make it more difficult to complete certain types of transactions and result in delays to our fundraising efforts.\nWe do not have sales and marketing capabilities, and consequently must rely on commercial collaborations to sell our products, and we and our collaborator may be unable to generate significant product revenue.\nIn December 2012, the FDA granted marketing approval for ADASUVE in the United States for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in adults. The approval of ADASUVE was our first regulatory approval. We do not have a sales and marketing organization and as a company, we do not have significant experience in the sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Teva Amendment to reacquire the ADASUVE U.S. commercial rights for and restructure our obligations under the Teva Note. The Teva Amendment provides for (i) the transfer of the NDA and related regulatory filings for ADASUVE to us and the assumption of responsibility by us for all regulatory activities related to ADASUVE in the U.S. as soon as practicable; (ii) an exclusive license of Teva intellectual property with respect to ADASUVE, which intellectual property will be assigned to us in connection with a change of control or an exclusive license to ADASUVE in the United States to a third party; (iii) our undertaking responsibility for the REMS program, either through Teva\u2019s vendors or vendors otherwise selected by us; (iv) the transfer from Teva of existing supplies of ADASUVE as well as all commercial, medical and academic materials, documents and relationships; (v) the right of us to sell Teva-labeled product in accordance with all applicable laws and Teva policies; and (vi) the satisfaction and termination of all payment obligations of the parties with respect to the commercialization of ADASUVE except as with respect to the Amended Teva Note and our issuance of 2,172,886 shares of our common stock to Teva. We plan to identify a new U.S. commercial partner for ADASUVE in 2016, however, we cannot be assured that we will be successful or whether or not the terms of such collaboration would be on terms less favorable to us than those of our future collaborators. Also, the end of Teva\u2019s commercialization efforts could have an effect on investors\u2019 perception of potential sales of ADASUVE inside and outside the United States, which could also cause a decline in our stock price and may make it more difficult for us to enter into additional strategic collaborations. The Notes issued by our wholly-owned subsidiary in conjunction with our royalty securitization financing are secured by the right to receive U.S. ADASUVE royalty and milestone payments and our equity ownership in the wholly-owned subsidiary. To date, royalties and milestone payments based on commercial sales of ADASUVE in the U.S. have not been sufficient to pay the amounts due under the Notes. If the amounts received by the wholly-owned subsidiary are not sufficient to meet the obligations under the Notes and we do not voluntarily provide the subsidiary with the funds to make required payments as they come due, the holders of the Notes may foreclose on the equity we own in the subsidiary and we could lose rights to receive future payments related to U.S. rights to ADASUVE.\nIn February 2013, the EC granted a marketing authorization for ADASUVE, as ADASUVE (Staccato loxapine) 4.5 mg or 9.1 mg, inhalation powder, pre-dispensed. In October 2011, we entered into a commercial collaboration with Ferrer pursuant to the Ferrer Agreement, to commercialize ADASUVE in the Ferrer Territories. The marketing authorization for ADASUVE is valid in all 28 EU Member States, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Beginning in August 2014, Ferrer began to receive individual country approvals in Latin America. As of September 30, 2015, Ferrer or its distributors, currently markets ADASUVE in nineteen countries of the Ferrer Territories (Austria, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Paraguay, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, and Sweden). Ferrer has also received\napproval to market ADASUVE in ten additional Latin American countries. Ferrer anticipates additional European and Latin American country approvals and launches in 2016. If Ferrer is unable to commercialize ADASUVE successfully in the various Ferrer Territories or if Ferrer is unable to fulfill the post-marketing authorization commitments that were required as part of the marketing authorization granted for ADASUVE in the EU, our revenue will suffer and our stock price may decline. The transfer of the MAA for ADASUVE to Ferrer was completed in August 2015.\nWe also intend to seek distribution collaborators in addition to Ferrer for ADASUVE and our product candidates. If we are unable to enter into an international or domestic distribution collaboration, we will be unable to generate revenues from countries outside the United States and the Ferrer Territories.\nIf we enter into additional strategic collaborations, we may be required to relinquish important rights to and control over the development of ADASUVE or our product candidates or otherwise be subject to terms unfavorable to us.\nOur relationship with Ferrer is, and any other strategic collaboration with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies we may establish will be, subject to a number of risks including:\n\u00b7\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a strategic collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a strategic collaborator\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to control the amount or timing of resources that our strategic collaborators devote to the development or commercialization of ADASUVE or our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour present and future strategic collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding, terminate a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new version of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7\nour present and future strategic collaborators may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from the strategic collaboration arrangement or may elect to discontinue research and development programs;\n\u00b7\nour present and future strategic collaborators may not commit adequate resources to the marketing and distribution of any future products, limiting our potential revenues from these products;\n\u00b7\ndisputes may arise between us and our strategic collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of ADASUVE or our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management\u2019s attention and consumes resources;\n\u00b7\nour present and future strategic collaborators may experience financial difficulties;\n\u00b7\nour present and future strategic collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in a manner that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7\nour present and future strategic collaborators could independently move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors; and\n\u00b7\nFerrer could terminate its arrangement with us or allow it to expire, which would delay and may increase the cost of developing our product candidates or commercializing ADASUVE.\nThe REMS program for ADASUVE imposes, and any REMS on any other approved products may impose, regulatory burdens on the distribution and sales of ADASUVE or any other approved products and also on healthcare providers that may make the products commercially unattractive or impractical.\nAs a condition of FDA approval, we are required to have a REMS program for ADASUVE, and we may be required to implement a REMS program for any other product candidates we may develop. A REMS may include various elements, such as distribution of a medication guide or a patient package insert; implementation of a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug\u2019s risks; imposition of limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, including training and certification requirements; or other measures that the FDA\ndeems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The FDA has a wide degree of discretion in deciding which elements are necessary for the safe use of a product, and it may impose elements that significantly burden our ability to commercialize the product, or that burden healthcare providers to the extent that use of the product is severely curtailed.\nFor ADASUVE, the REMS program contains measures to ensure that the product is administered only in healthcare facilities enrolled in the ADASUVE REMS program that have immediate on-site access to equipment and personnel trained to manage acute bronchospasm, including advanced airway management (intubation and mechanical ventilation). The REMS program may not allow commercialization and use of ADASUVE in a commercially feasible manner. In the future, the FDA could impose additional REMS elements, such as if the REMS proves inadequate in managing the risk of bronchospasm associated with ADASUVE or if new safety risks emerge, and such additional elements could substantially burden or even eliminate our ability to commercialize ADASUVE in a feasible manner.\nIf we or our current and future collaborators are unable to successfully complete the ADASUVE post-marketing studies required by the FDA and EC, or if data generated from the post-marketing studies indicate safety concerns, our sales could be diminished and our ability to generate a profit could be negatively affected.\nAs a condition of U.S. ADASUVE approval, there are several required post-marketing studies, including a 10,000 patient observational clinical trial that is designed to gather patient safety data based on the \u201creal-world\u201d use of ADASUVE in the hospital setting and a clinical program designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in agitated adolescent patients. The data derived from any post-approval study or trial could result in additional restrictions on the commercialization of ADASUVE through changes to the approved ADASUVE label, additional goals or elements in the REMS program, the imposition of additional post-approval studies or trials, or even the withdrawal of the approval of ADASUVE. Our business, operations and stock price may be negatively affected if any of these or similar events occur.\nAs a condition of the ADASUVE EU marketing authorisation, we were responsible for conducting and funding the post-approval studies, including (i) a benzodiazepine interaction study, which has been completed, (ii) a controlled study to determine ADASUVE\u2019s effect on cardiac rhythms, or a thorough QTc study, with two doses of ADASUVE, which has been completed, (iii) a clinical program designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in agitated adolescent patients, (iv) an observational clinical trial, and (v) a drug utilization clinical trial. As part of the transfer of the MAA to Ferrer in June 2015, Ferrer assumed responsibility for completing any outstanding studies. Results of the benzodiazepine interaction study and the thorough QTc study have been submitted to the EMA.\nIf we and our present or future collaborators are unable to fulfill the FDA or EU post-marketing obligations, or do not fulfill these obligations within an appropriate time, or if the EMA determines from the results of the completed benzodiazepine interaction study or the completed thorough QTc study that ADASUVE poses or may pose actual or possible safety risks to some patients, the NDA could be suspended, withdrawn, or limited, and the current marketing authorization in the EU could be varied, suspended or withdrawn and our business, operations and stock price may be negatively affected.\nAdditionally, in February 2016 we reacquired the U.S. rights for ADASUVE from Teva including the assumption of responsibility by us for all regulatory activities related to ADASUVE in the United States as soon as practicable. We cannot be assured that we will be able to fulfill these FDA post-marketing obligations without the support of Teva.\nIf we do not produce our commercial devices cost effectively, we will never be profitable.\nADASUVE and our Staccato system-based product candidates contain electronic and other components in addition to the API. The cost to produce ADASUVE and our product candidates, and any additional approved products, will likely be higher per dose than the cost to produce intravenous or oral tablet products. This higher cost of goods may prevent us or our collaborators from ever selling any products at a profit. The development and production of our technology entail a number of technical challenges, including achieving adequate dependability in our production, that may be expensive or time consuming to solve. Any delay in or failure to develop and\nmanufacture any future products in a cost effective way could prevent us from generating any meaningful revenues and prevent us from becoming profitable.\nIn October 2011, we committed to sell ADASUVE to Ferrer for a fixed transfer price, which is below our current production costs, and in May 2013, we committed to supply ADASUVE to Teva at a price based on costs of commercial production, which transfer price will convert to a fixed price upon achievement of costs equal to a specified per-unit price. In February 2016 we reacquired the U.S. rights for ADASUVE from Teva. We cannot be assured that the supply terms to a future collaborator, if any, will be on equivalent or better terms as with Teva. Our future manufacturing costs per unit will be dependent on future demand of ADASUVE. If we and our present and future collaborators do not generate sufficient demand, our manufacturing costs will exceed the fixed transfer price and will result in losses. If we are unable to generate profits from manufacturing our products, we may be required to seek alternative manufacturing strategies.\nDuring 2013 and 2014, Alexza completed production of ADASUVE for commercial launch and initial stocking, which did not utilize Alexza\u2019s full manufacturing capacity. In collaboration with Teva and Ferrer, Alexza conducted an analysis to evaluate need for the product and cost-effective strategies for ADASUVE commercial production. The analysis included supply chain requirements, production volume and timelines, batch sizes and possible scenarios to make global production more efficient and cost-effective. In the first quarter of 2015, Teva and Ferrer provided longer-term, ADASUVE orders, allowing us to manufacture ADASUVE in a consistent manner to take advantage of the efficiencies of continued batch production. During the third quarter of 2015, we completed all required ADASUVE production for Teva\u2019s and Ferrer\u2019s ADASUVE orders. As a result, we suspended our ADASUVE commercial manufacturing operations. We plan for ADASUVE commercial production to resume in the future as additional commercial product is required by Ferrer or any future collaborators. We may also consider contracting with third party manufacturers for ADASUVE units if deemed more efficient, including third-party manufacturers with multi-product facilities. We cannot predict when, if ever, we will begin to again commercially manufacture ADASUVE. If we do not restart our commercial manufacturing, we cannot predict if third-party manufacturers will be able to produce ADASUVE at a price which would allow us to generate profits.\nThe availability and amount of reimbursement for ADASUVE and our product candidates and the manner in which government and private payors may reimburse for our potential products is uncertain.\nMany of the patients in the United States who seek treatment with ADASUVE or any other of our products that are approved for marketing will be eligible for Medicare benefits. Other patients may be covered by private health plans. The Medicare program is administered by CMS, and coverage and reimbursement for products and services under Medicare are determined pursuant to statute, regulations promulgated by CMS, and CMS\u2019s subregulatory coverage and reimbursement determinations. CMS\u2019s regulations and interpretive determinations are subject to change, as are the procedures and criteria by which CMS makes coverage and reimbursement determinations and the reimbursement amounts established by statute, particularly because of budgetary pressures facing the Medicare program. For example, we anticipate that ADASUVE will be used only in the hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient settings. In the hospital inpatient setting, Medicare does not provide separate reimbursement for drugs but pays for them as part of the payment for the hospital stay. In the hospital outpatient setting, the statute establishes the payment rate for new drugs and biologicals administered incident to a physician\u2019s service that are granted \u201cpass-through status\u201d at the rate applicable in physicians\u2019 offices (i.e., ASP plus six percent) for two to three years after FDA approval. For drugs and biologicals that do not have pass-through status, CMS establishes the payment rates by regulation. For 2015, these drugs are reimbursed at ASP plus six percent if they have an average cost per day exceeding $95; drugs with an average cost per day of less than $95 are not separately reimbursed. In future years, CMS could change both the payment rate and the average cost threshold, and these changes could adversely affect payment for ADASUVE. In addition, the President has proposed and Congress has considered amending the statute to reduce Medicare\u2019s payment rates for drugs and biologicals, and if such legislation is enacted, it could adversely affect payment for ADASUVE. Moreover, ADASUVE is different from many drugs covered by Medicare Part B because it is administered by a healthcare professional through a disposable inhaler.\nEffective April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologicals, were reduced by up to 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-25, or BCA, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, Pub. L. 112-240, or ATRA. The BCA requires sequestration for most federal programs, excluding Medicaid, Social Security,\nand certain other programs, because Congress failed to enact legislation by January 15, 2012, to reduce federal deficits by $1.2 trillion over ten years. The BCA caps the cuts to Medicare payments or items and services at 2%, and requires the cuts to be implemented on the first day of the first month following the issuance of a sequestration order. The ATRA delayed implementation of sequestration from January 2, 2013, to March 1, 2013, and as a result, the Medicare cuts took effect April 1, 2013, and will remain in effect unless Congress enacts legislation to cancel the cuts. The cuts were originally scheduled to occur through 2021, but under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, these cuts were extended through 2023. These cuts could adversely impact payment for ADASUVE and related procedures.\nIn March 2014, Teva announced the U.S. launch of ADASUVE. We expect ADASUVE to experience pricing pressures in the United States due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals. We cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts, or the lack of reimbursement, will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, ADASUVE or any future products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we or any collaborator may not be able to effectively commercialize ADASUVE or any future products, In addition, if we or any collaborator fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for ADASUVE or any future products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we or any collaborator will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed.\nPayors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as ASP, AMP and Actual Acquisition Cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. CMS has made draft National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, and draft National Average Retail Price, or NARP, data publicly available on at least a monthly basis. In July 2013, CMS suspended the publication of draft NARP data, pending funding decisions. In November 2013, CMS moved to publishing final rather than draft NADAC data and has since made updated NADAC data publicly available on a weekly basis. Therefore, it may be difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover ADASUVE or any future products. As discussed below, once we or any collaborator begin to participate in government pricing programs, recent legislative changes to the 340B drug pricing program, and the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also could impact our revenues. We anticipate that a significant portion of our revenue from sales of ADASUVE will be obtained through government payors, including Medicaid, and any failure to qualify for reimbursement for ADASUVE under those programs would have a material negative effect on revenues from sales of ADASUVE.\nThe EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume-based arrangements and reference pricing mechanisms. We anticipate that pricing and reimbursement decisions concerning ADASUVE in the EU will have a significant impact on the sales of the product in the EU. Failure to obtain pricing and reimbursement for ADASUVE at an appropriate level in any of the EU Member States would, in part due to EU parallel trade rules, have a material adverse effect on revenues from sales of ADASUVE.\nHealthcare law and policy changes, including those based on recently enacted legislation, may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict and these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. In March 2010, the Healthcare Reform Act, or PPACA, was adopted in the United States. The Healthcare Reform Act substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations, in some cases in ways we cannot currently predict. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal and private healthcare programs, new Medicare reimbursement methods and rates, increased rebates and taxes on pharmaceutical products, expansion of the 340B program, and revised fraud and abuse and enforcement requirements. These changes will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in\nthe development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.\nWe anticipate that if we continue to commercialize ADASUVE in the United States or other potential product candidates, some of our revenue and the revenue from our future collaborators may be derived from U.S. government healthcare programs, including Medicare. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have an adverse effect on our industry generally and the ability to successfully commercialize ADASUVE or our product candidates or could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects.\nThe Healthcare Reform Act made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, in which we expect to participate. Effective March 23, 2010, rebate liability expanded from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well. With regard to the amount of the rebates owed, the Healthcare Reform Act increased the minimum Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price for most innovator products and from 11% to 13% for non-innovator products; changed the calculation of the rebate for certain innovator products that qualify as line extensions of existing drugs; and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the average manufacturer price. We expect that the increased minimum rebate of 23.1% will apply to ADASUVE. Finally, the Healthcare Reform Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government beginning in 2011. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $3.0 billion in 2015 (and set to increase in ensuing years), based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Additional provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act, some of which became effective in 2011, may negatively affect our future revenues.\nThe Healthcare Reform Act also expanded the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing discount program, which we expect to participate in. The 340B pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs. The Healthcare Reform Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Healthcare Reform Act. The Healthcare Reform Act, as drafted, exempted \u201corphan drugs\u201d - those designated under section 526 of the FDCA - from the ceiling price requirements for these newly-eligible entities.\nThe Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, which administers the 340B program, previously had issued a final regulation to implement the orphan drug exception that interpreted the orphan drug exception narrowly. That final regulation was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on May 23, 2014 on the ground that HRSA did not have the authority to issue a regulation on this topic. On July 21 2014, HRSA issued an \u201cinterpretive\u201d rule that again interprets the orphan drug exception narrowly, consistent with the invalidated final rule. Like the invalidated final rule, it exempts orphan drugs from the ceiling price requirements for the newly-eligible entities only when the orphan drug is used for its orphan indication. Under the interpretive rule, the newly-eligible entities are entitled to purchase orphan drugs at the ceiling price when the orphan drug is not used for its orphan indication. The uncertainty regarding how the statutory orphan drug exception will be applied will increase the complexity of compliance, will make compliance more time-consuming, and could negatively impact our results of operations. HRSA previously was expected to issue a comprehensive proposed regulation in 2014 that would have addressed many aspects of the 340B program. However, the invalidation of the orphan drug regulation on the ground that HRSA did not have rulemaking authority for that topic has raised questions regarding whether HRSA has the authority to issue the comprehensive regulation. We have applied for orphan drug status for AZ-002, and expect to apply for orphan drug status in the EU. There can be no assurance that AZ-002 will receive such designation, and should HRSA successfully attempt to limit the scope of the orphan drug exception in the future, this might have a negative impact on our business.\nThe Healthcare Reform Act also obligates the Secretary of the HHS to create regulations and processes to improve the integrity of the 340B program and to update the agreement that manufacturers must sign to participate in the 340B program to obligate a manufacturer to offer the 340B price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes the drug available to any other purchaser at any price and to report to the government the ceiling prices for its drugs. HRSA has stated on its website that in 2015 it plans to issue a proposed guidance for notice and comment that will\naddress key policy issues raised by various stakeholders committed to the integrity of the 340B program. HRSA also states it is planning to issue proposed rules pertaining to civil monetary penalties for manufacturers, calculation of the 340B ceiling price, and administrative dispute resolution. When this guidance is issued, it could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in the inpatient setting.\nMany of the Healthcare Reform Act\u2019s most significant reforms started taking effect last year with more still pending, and the details will be shaped significantly as the various provisions become active, especially given the political nature of the law. In 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States heard challenges to the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the viability of certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision upheld most of the Healthcare Reform Act and determined that requiring individuals to maintain \u201cminimum essential\u201d health insurance coverage or pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service was within Congress\u2019s constitutional taxing authority. However, the Supreme Court struck down a provision in the Healthcare Reform Act that penalized states that choose not to expand their Medicaid programs through an increase in the Medicaid eligibility income limit from a state\u2019s current eligibility levels to 133% of the federal poverty limit. As a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, it is unclear whether states will expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level and whether there will be more uninsured patients in 2015 than anticipated when Congress passed the Healthcare Reform Act. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there will be fewer insured patients overall. The reduction in the number of insured patients could impact the sales, business and financial condition.\nWhile the constitutionality of key provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act was upheld by the Supreme Court, legislative changes to it remain possible. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates or could limit or eliminate our future spending on development projects.\nIn addition to the Healthcare Reform Act, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to keep these costs down while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for ADASUVE or any other product candidates that are approved or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies or third-party payors, or may increase the tax obligations on life sciences companies such as ours. While it is too early to predict specifically what effect the Health Reform Act and its implementation or any future legislation or policies will have on our business, we believe that healthcare reform may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf future products are regulated solely as medical devices and we fail to complete the required IRS forms for exemptions, make timely semi-monthly payments of collected excise taxes, or submit quarterly reports as required by the Medical Device Excise Tax, we may be subject to penalties, such as Section 6656 penalties for any failure to make timely deposits.\nSection 4191 of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted by Section 1405 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Public Law 111-152 (124 Stat. 1029 (2010)), in conjunction with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148 (124 Stat. 119 (2010)), imposed as of January 1, 2013, an excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices. The excise tax imposed by Section 4191 is 2.3% of the price for which a taxable medical device is sold within the U.S.\nIf FDA determines that any future company product is regulated as a medical device, the excise tax will apply to future sales of any company medical device listed with the FDA under Section 510(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 21 C.F.R. Part 807, unless the device falls within an exemption from the tax, such as the exemption governing direct retail sale of devices to consumers or for foreign sales of these devices. We will need to assess to what extent this excise tax may impact the sales price and distribution agreements under which any of our products are sold in the U.S. If any product is regulated as a medical device, we expect general and administrative expense to increase due to the medical device excise tax. We will need to submit IRS forms applicable to relevant exemptions, make semi-monthly payments of any collected excise taxes, and make timely (quarterly) reports to the\nIRS regarding the excise tax. To the extent we do not comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Excise Tax we may be subject to penalties.\nIf we or any collaborator fail to comply with reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, including programs developed by countries outside the United States, after we or any collaborator begin to participate in such programs, we or any collaborator could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe expect to participate, or any collaborator to participate, in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and amended by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 as well as subsequent legislation. We also expect to participate, or any collaborator to participate, in and have certain price reporting obligations to several state Medicaid supplemental rebate programs, and we anticipate that we will have obligations to report ASP for the Medicare program for future product candidates. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we will be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates will be based on pricing data that we will report on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. These data will include the AMP and, in the case of innovator products, the best price, or BP, for each drug. The rebate liability resulting from this reporting will negatively impact our financial results.\nThe PPACA made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Effective March 23, 2010, rebate liability expanded from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well. With regard to the amount of the rebates owed, the PPACA increased the minimum Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price for most innovator products and from 11% to 13% for non-innovator products; changed the calculation of the rebate for certain innovator products that qualify as line extensions of existing drugs; and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the average manufacturer price. We expect that the increased minimum rebate of 23.1% will apply to ADASUVE. In addition, the PPACA and subsequent legislation changed the definition of AMP. Finally, the PPACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a new branded prescription drug fee to the federal government beginning in 2011. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer will pay a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $3.0 billion in 2014 (and set to increase in ensuing years) based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Additional provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act, some of which became effective in 2011, may negatively affect our future revenues.\nIn the future, Congress could enact legislation that further increases Medicaid drug rebates or other costs and charges associated with participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. The issuance of regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program will increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, will be time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFederal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing discount program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid rebate program. Changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid rebate amount under PPACA and CMS\u2019s issuance of final regulations implementing those changes also could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations once we or any collaborator begin to participate in the 340B program.\nCompliance with the regulations associated with the 340B program will increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, will be time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations once we or any collaborator begin to participate in the 340B program.\nAs described above, the Healthcare Reform Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities but exempts \u201corphan drugs\u201d - those designated under section 526 of the FDCA - from the ceiling price requirements for these newly-eligible entities. We believe our product candidate in active development, AZ-002 (Staccato alprazolam), could qualify for orphan drug status. HRSA previously had issued a final regulation to implement the orphan drug exception that interpreted the orphan drug exception narrowly. That final regulation was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on May 23, 2014 on the ground that HRSA did not have the authority to issue a regulation on this topic. On July 21 2014, HRSA issued an \u201cinterpretive\u201d rule that again interprets the orphan drug exception narrowly, consistent with the invalidated final rule. Like the invalidated final rule, it exempts orphan drugs from the ceiling price requirements for the newly-eligible entities only when the orphan drug is used for its orphan indication. Under the interpretive rule, the newly-eligible entities are entitled to purchase orphan drugs at the ceiling price when the orphan drug is not used for its orphan indication. The uncertainty regarding how the statutory orphan drug exception will be applied will increase the complexity of compliance, will make compliance more time-consuming, and could negatively impact our results of operations. HRSA previously was expected to issue a comprehensive proposed regulation in 2014 that would have addressed many aspects of the 340B program. However, the invalidation of the orphan drug regulation on the ground that HRSA did not have rulemaking authority for that topic has raised questions regarding whether HRSA has the authority to issue the comprehensive regulation.\nThe Healthcare Reform Act also obligates the Secretary of the HHS to create regulations and processes to improve the integrity of the 340B program and to update the agreement that manufacturers must sign to participate in the 340B program to obligate a manufacturer to offer the 340B price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes the drug available to any other purchaser at any price and to report to the government the ceiling prices for its drugs. HRSA has stated that in 2015 it plans to issue a proposed guidance for notice and comment that will address key policy issues raised by various stakeholders committed to the integrity of the 340B program. HRSA also states it is planning to issue proposed rules pertaining to civil monetary penalties for manufacturers, calculation of the 340B ceiling price, and administrative dispute resolution.\nFederal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program report ASP information to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program. We anticipate that ADASUVE will fall into that category. Manufacturers calculate ASP based on a statutorily defined formula and interpretations of the statute by CMS as to what should or should not be considered in computing ASP. An ASP for each National Drug Code for a product that is subject to the ASP reporting requirement must be submitted to CMS no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. Once we or any collaborator begin to participate in the Medicare program, changes affecting the calculation of ASP could affect the ASP calculations for our products and the resulting Medicare payment rate, and could negatively impact our results of operations once we begin to participate in the Medicare program.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. Once we or any collaborator begin to participate in the Medicaid program, the Medicaid rebate amount will be computed each quarter based on our submission to the CMS of our current AMP and BP for the quarter. If we become aware that our reporting for prior quarters was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we or any collaborator will be obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would serve to increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid rebate program. Once we begin to participate in the Medicaid program, any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the price that we or any collaborator will be required to charge certain safety-net providers under the Public Health Service 340B drug discount program.\nOnce we or any collaborator begin to participate in government pricing programs, we or any collaborator will be liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we or any collaborator are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price, average sales price, or best price information to the government, we or any collaborator may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price, average sales price, and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $10,000 per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. In the event that CMS were to terminate our rebate agreement after we or any collaborator begin to participate in the Medicaid program, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.\nIn September 2010, CMS and the Office of the Inspector General indicated that they intend to pursue more aggressively companies who fail to report these data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. We cannot assure you that our or any collaborator\u2019s submissions, once we or any collaborator begin to submit pricing data to CMS, will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.\nFederal law requires that for a company to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs, as well as to be purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, it also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. To participate, we or any collaborator will be required to enter into an FSS contract with the VA, under which we must make our innovator \u201ccovered drugs,\u201d such as ADASUVE or other product candidates, available to the \u201cBig Four\u201d federal agencies - the VA, the Department of Defense, or DoD, the Public Health Service, and the Coast Guard - at pricing that is capped pursuant to a statutory federal ceiling price, or FCP, formula set forth in Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA. The FCP is based on a weighted average wholesaler price known as the \u201cnon-federal average manufacturer price,\u201d or Non-FAMP, which manufacturers are required to report on a quarterly and annual basis to the VA. If a company misstates Non-FAMPs or FCPs it must restate these figures. Pursuant to the VHCA, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to penalties of $100,000 for each item of false information.\nFSS contracts are federal procurement contracts that include standard government terms and conditions, separate pricing for each product, and extensive disclosure and certification requirements. All items on FSS contracts are subject to a standard FSS contract clause that requires FSS contract price reductions under certain circumstances where pricing is reduced to an agreed \u201ctracking customer.\u201d Further, in addition to the \u201cBig Four\u201d agencies, all other federal agencies and some non-federal entities are authorized to access FSS contracts. FSS contractors are permitted to charge FSS purchasers other than the Big Four agencies \u201cnegotiated pricing\u201d for covered drugs that is not capped by the FCP; instead, such pricing is negotiated based on a mandatory disclosure of the contractor\u2019s commercial \u201cmost favored customer\u201d pricing. We cannot anticipate the pricing structure we will enter into with respect to our products. The FSS contract price may have a material adverse effect on future revenues from sales of ADASUVE.\nOnce we or any collaborator enter into an FSS contract, if we or any collaborator overcharge the government in connection with the FSS contract, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we or any collaborator will be required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges could result in allegations under the Federal False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we or any collaborators fail to gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community, we will not become profitable.\nThe Staccato system is a fundamentally new method of drug delivery. ADASUVE or any future product based on our Staccato system may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we will not meet our revenue guidance nor will we generate sufficient product or royalty revenues to become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of ADASUVE or any of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our collaborators\u2019 sales forces to convince potential purchasers of ADASUVE\u2019s advantages over other treatments;\n\u00b7\ndemonstration of acceptable quality, safety and efficacy in clinical trials and meeting applicable regulatory standards for approval;\n\u00b7\nthe existence, prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u00b7\npotential or perceived advantages or disadvantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\ntherapeutic or other improvements of ADASUVE over existing or future drugs used to treat the same or similar conditions;\n\u00b7\nperceptions about the relationship or similarity between ADASUVE or our product candidates and the parent drug compound upon which ADASUVE or our product candidate is based;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of market entry relative to competitive treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to produce ADASUVE or any future products in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to offer ADASUVE or any future products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u00b7\nrelative convenience, product dependability and ease of administration;\n\u00b7\nthe restrictions imposed on ADASUVE by the REMS program and labeling requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nacceptance by patients, the medical community or third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nthe sufficiency of coverage and reimbursement of ADASUVE or our product candidates by governmental and other third-party payors; and\n\u00b7\nthe product labeling, including the package insert, and the marketing restrictions required by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries.\nWe are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our and our collaborators\u2019 ability to commercialize our products.\nWe and our collaborators are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations, such as safety reporting requirements, periodic and annual reporting requirements, and regulatory oversight of the promotion and marketing of our products. In addition, the manufacture, labeling, packaging, distribution, import, export, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for ADASUVE and any of our product candidates that may be approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. We are responsible for completing several post-marketing requirements that were a condition to FDA approval of ADASUVE, including the responsibility for conducting a 10,000 patient observational clinical trial designed to gather patient safety data based on the real-world use of ADASUVE, as well as a clinical program addressing the safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in agitated adolescent patients. The adolescent efficacy study has been completed. With the reacquisition of commercial rights, we have the responsibility for the remaining post marketing requirements. As a condition of grant of EU marketing authorization for ADASUVE by the EC, we were responsible for the conduct and funding of post-authorization studies, including (i) a benzodiazepine interaction\nstudy, which has been completed, (ii) a controlled study to determine ADASUVE\u2019s effect on cardiac rhythms, or a thorough QTc study, with two doses of ADASUVE, which has been completed, (iii) a clinical program designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in agitated adolescent patients, (iv) an observational clinical trial, and (v) a drug utilization clinical trial. As part of the transfer of the MAA to Ferrer in June 2015, Ferrer assumed responsibility for completing any outstanding EU studies.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may also impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our future products, or impose requirements for burdensome post-approval study commitments. For example, ADASUVE\u2019s U.S. labeling contains a \u201cboxed warning\u201d regarding the risks of bronchospasm caused by the product and the increased risk of death for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. Boxed warnings are used to highlight warning information that is especially important to the prescriber. Products with boxed warnings are subject to more restrictive advertising and promotion regulations than products without such warnings. The terms of any product approval, including labeling, may be more restrictive than we desire and could affect the commercial potential of the product. If we become aware of previously unknown problems with any of our products in the United States or overseas or at our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, a regulatory agency may impose labeling changes or restrictions on our products, our collaborators, our manufacturers or on us. In such an instance, we could experience a significant drop in the sales of the affected products, our product revenues and reputation in the marketplace may suffer, and we could become the target of lawsuits.\nThe FDA and other governmental authorities, including foreign regulatory authorities, also actively enforce regulations prohibiting off-label promotion, and governments have levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion. Governments have also required companies to enter into corporate integrity agreements and/or non-prosecution agreements that impose significant reporting and other burdens on the affected companies.\nWe and our commercial collaborators are also subject to regulation by regional, national, state and local agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory bodies, as well as governmental authorities in those foreign countries in which we may in the future commercialize our products. The FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, the Social Security Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern to varying degrees the research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities relating to prescription pharmaceutical products, including preclinical testing, approval, production, labeling, sale, distribution, import, export, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information, promotion, marketing, and pricing to government purchasers and government healthcare programs. Any manufacturing, licensing, or commercialization collaborators we have or may in the future have, including Ferrer, will be subject to many of the same requirements.\nThe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Further, the Healthcare Reform Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. We intend to comply with the exemptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but our practices or those of our commercial collaborators may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability and may be subject to scrutiny.\nThe Federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and have\nreached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under these laws for a variety of alleged marketing activities, including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees, grants, free travel, and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe our products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs. Companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the marketing of their products for unapproved uses. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have also been prosecuted on other legal theories of Medicare and Medicaid fraud.\nThe majority of U.S. states also have statutes or regulations similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Federal False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.\nCompliance with various federal and state laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that violate them may face substantial penalties. The potential sanctions include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a company\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. Because of the breadth of these laws and the lack of extensive legal guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, it is possible that some of our business activities or those of our commercial collaborators could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and growth prospects.\nWe or our commercial collaborators could become subject to government investigations and related subpoenas. Such subpoenas are often associated with previously filed qui tam actions, or lawsuits filed under seal under the Federal False Claims Act. Qui tam actions are brought by private plaintiffs suing on behalf of the federal government for alleged Federal False Claims Act violations. The time and expense associated with responding to such subpoenas, and any related qui tam or other actions, may be extensive, and we cannot predict the results of our review of the responsive documents and underlying facts or the results of such actions. Responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties, settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.\nThe number and complexity of both federal and state laws continues to increase, and additional governmental resources are being added to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. In particular, the Healthcare Reform Act includes a number of provisions aimed at strengthening the government\u2019s ability to pursue anti-kickback and false claims cases against pharmaceutical manufacturers and other healthcare entities, including substantially increased funding for healthcare fraud enforcement activities, enhanced investigative powers, amendments to the False Claims Act that make it easier for the government and whistleblowers to pursue cases for alleged kickback and false claim violations and, since last year, payments made on or after August 1, 2013, public reporting of payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers to physicians and teaching hospitals nationwide. While it is too early to predict what effect these changes will have on our business, we anticipate that government scrutiny of pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices will continue for the foreseeable future and subject us and our commercial collaborators to the risk of government investigations and enforcement actions. Responding to a government investigation or enforcement action would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and growth prospects.\nSimilar restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of medicinal products in the EU and other countries. The applicable laws at EU level and in the individual EU Member States require promotional materials and advertising concerning medicinal products to comply with the product\u2019s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of a medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product which does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of\nmedicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at both EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.\nInteractions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians\u2019 codes of professional conduct in the individual EU Member States. The provision of any inducement to physicians to prescribe, recommend, endorse, order, purchase, supply, use or administer a medicinal product is prohibited. A number of EU Member States have introduced additional rules requiring pharmaceutical companies to publically disclose their interactions with physicians and to obtain approval from employers, professional organizations and/or competent authorities before entering into agreements with physicians. Violations of these rules could lead to the imposition of fines or imprisonment.\nLaws, including those governing promotion, marketing and anti-kickback provisions, industry regulations and professional codes of conduct are often strictly enforced. Increasing regulatory scrutiny of the promotional activities of pharmaceutical companies has been observed in a number of EU Member States. The Bribery Act in the United Kingdom entered into force on 1 July 2011. This Act applies to any company incorporated in or \u201ccarrying on business\u201d in the UK, irrespective of where in the world the alleged bribery activity occurs. Even though we strive for complete and continuous adherence to all laws and rules during our promotion and marketing activities, this Act could have implications for our interactions or those of Ferrer with physicians both in and outside the UK.\nPayments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publically disclosed and this obligation will expand to other EU Member States. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment. Even in those countries where we are not directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our products, inappropriate activity by our international distribution collaborators can have implications for us.\nIf we or any current or future collaborators fail to comply with applicable federal, state, local, or foreign regulatory requirements, we or they could be subject to a range of regulatory actions that could affect our or any collaborators\u2019 ability to commercialize our products and could harm or prevent sales of the affected products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products. Any threatened or actual government enforcement action could also generate adverse publicity and require that we devote substantial resources that could otherwise be used in other aspects of our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of applicable anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010.\nAnti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, generally prohibit directly or indirectly giving, offering, or promising anything of value to improperly induce the recipient to act, or refrain from acting, in a manner that would confer a commercial advantage. The anti-bribery provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act generally prohibit directly or indirectly giving, offering or promising an inducement to a public official (broadly interpreted) to corruptly influence the official\u2019s actions in order to obtain a commercial advantage. The U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery in both the private and public sectors. In addition, an organization that \u201cfails to prevent bribery\u201d by anyone associated with the organization may be charged under the U.K. Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented \u201cadequate procedures\u201d to prevent bribery. In recent years, the U.S. Government has brought enforcement actions that resulted in significant monetary penalties against several multinational healthcare companies for violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act stemming from illegal payments and other illegal benefits provided to non-U.S. healthcare professionals. We plan to adopt and implement policies and procedures designed to ensure that those involved in the marketing, sale, and distribution of our products are both aware of these legal requirements and committed to complying therewith. However, we cannot assure that these policies and procedures will protect us from potentially illegal acts committed by individual employees or agents. If we were found to be liable for anti-corruption law violations, we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf we do not establish additional strategic collaborations, we will have to undertake additional development and future commercialization efforts on our own, which would be costly and delay our ability to commercialize any future products.\nAn element of our business strategy is our intent to selectively collaborate with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies to obtain assistance for the development and commercialization of ADASUVE and our product candidates. In October 2011, we entered into the Ferrer Agreement with Ferrer for the commercialization of ADASUVE in the Ferrer Territories. In May 2013, we entered into a commercial collaboration with Teva, granting Teva an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ADASUVE in the United States. In February 2016 we reacquired the U.S. rights for ADASUVE from Teva. We cannot be assured that we will be able to successfully commercialize ADASUVE in the U.S. As a result of our reacquisition of the U.S. rights to ADASUVE, we plan to identify a new U.S. commercial partner for ADASUVE in 2016, however, we cannot be assured that we will be successful or whether or not the terms of such collaboration would be on terms less favorable to us than those of the Teva Agreement. We may never enter into additional strategic collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize ADASUVE or our product candidates. Other than Ferrer, we do not currently have any strategic collaborations for ADASUVE or any of our product candidates. The Notes issued by our wholly-owned subsidiary in conjunction with our royalty securitization financing are secured by the right to receive royalty and milestone payments based on commercial sales of ADASUVE in the U.S. and our equity ownership in the wholly-owned subsidiary. To date, royalties and milestone payments based on commercial sales of ADASUVE in the U.S. have not been sufficient to pay the amounts due under the Notes. If the amounts received by the wholly-owned subsidiary are not sufficient to meet the obligations under the Notes and we do not voluntarily provide the subsidiary with the funds to make required payments as they come due, the holders of the Notes may foreclose on the equity we own in the subsidiary and we could lose rights to receive future payments related to U.S. rights to ADASUVE.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators, and these strategic collaborations can be intricate and time consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate additional strategic collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any additional strategic collaborations because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic collaborations. We are currently seeking collaborations to commercialize ADASUVE outside of the United States and the Ferrer Territories. If we are unable to negotiate additional strategic collaborations for ADASUVE outside of the United States and the Ferrer Territories, we may be unable to maximize ADASUVE\u2019s commercial potential.\nIf we are unable to negotiate additional collaborations for ADASUVE or our product candidates we may be forced to curtail the development of a particular candidate, reduce or delay its development program, or one or more of our other development programs, delay its commercialization, or undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. In addition, we will bear all the risk related to the development of a product candidate. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring ADASUVE or our product candidates to market successfully and generate revenue or profit.\nADASUVE and any of our product candidates approved for marketing remain subject to ongoing regulatory review in the United States, the EU or in other countries. If we or any collaborators fail to comply with the regulations, we could lose these approvals, and the sale of any future products could be suspended. If approval is denied or limited in a country, or if a country imposes post-marketing requirements, that decision could negatively affect our ability to market our product in such countries.\nEven with regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the FDA, the EC or another foreign regulatory authority could condition approval on conducting additional costly post-approval studies or trials or could limit the scope of our approved labeling or could impose burdensome post-approval obligations, such as those required in the United States and in the post-marketing obligations required as part of a marketing authorization in the EU. Moreover, the product may later cause adverse effects that limit or prevent its widespread use, force us to withdraw it from the market, cause the FDA, the EC or another foreign regulatory authority to impose additional obligations or restriction on marketing, or impede or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approvals in additional countries. In addition, we will continue to be subject to FDA, EMA, EC and other foreign regulatory authority\nregulations, as well as periodic inspections to ensure adherence to applicable regulations. After receiving marketing approval, the FDA, the EC and other foreign regulatory authorities could impose extensive regulatory requirements on the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, distribution, and record keeping related to the product. The approval of the ADASUVE NDA requires that we implement, administer and assess at regular intervals a REMS program that, among other things, limits the use of ADASUVE to healthcare facilities enrolled in the ADASUVE REMS program.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Teva Amendment to reacquire the ADASUVE U.S. commercial rights for and restructure our obligations under the Teva Note. The Teva Amendment provides for (i) the transfer of the NDA and related regulatory filings for ADASUVE to us and the assumption of responsibility by us for all regulatory activities related to ADASUVE in the U.S. as soon as practicable; (ii) an exclusive license of Teva intellectual property with respect to ADASUVE, which intellectual property will be assigned to us in connection with a change of control or an exclusive license to ADASUVE in the United States to a third party; (iii) our undertaking responsibility for the REMS program, either through Teva\u2019s vendors or vendors otherwise selected by us; (iv) the transfer from Teva of existing supplies of ADASUVE as well as all commercial, medical and academic materials, documents and relationships; (v) the right of us to sell Teva-labeled product in accordance with all applicable laws and Teva policies; and (vi) the satisfaction and termination of all payment obligations of the parties with respect to the commercialization of ADASUVE except as with respect to the Amended Teva Note and our issuance of 2,172,886 shares of our common stock to Teva.\nWe plan to identify a new U.S. commercial partner for ADASUVE in 2016, however, we cannot be assured that we will be successful or whether or not the terms of such collaboration would be on terms less favorable to us than those of the Teva Agreement. Notes issued by our wholly-owned subsidiary in conjunction with the royalty securitization financing are secured by the right to receive U.S. ADASUVE royalty and milestone payments and our equity ownership in the wholly-owned subsidiary. To date, royalties and milestone payments based on commercial sales of ADASUVE in the U.S. have not been sufficient to pay the amounts due under the Notes. If the amounts received by the wholly-owned subsidiary are not sufficient to meet the obligations under the Notes and we do not voluntarily provide the subsidiary with the funds to make required payments as they come due, the Note holders may foreclose on the equity we own in the subsidiary and we could lose rights to receive future payments related to U.S. rights to ADASUVE.\nAs a condition to marketing authorization for ADASUVE granted by the EC in the EU, we are responsible for the conduct and funding of post-marketing studies, including (i) a benzodiazepine interaction study, which has been completed, (ii) a controlled study to determine ADASUVE\u2019s effect on cardiac rhythms, or a thorough QTc study, with two doses of ADASUVE, which has been completed, (iii) a clinical program designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in agitated adolescent patients, (iv) an observational clinical study, and (v) a drug utilization study. Results of the benzodiazepine interaction study and the thorough QTc study have been submitted to the EMA. As part of the transfer of the MAA to Ferrer in June 2015, Ferrer assumed responsibility for completing any outstanding studies.\nThe costs associated with development and approval of study protocols and the completion of studies and clinical trials are significant. There are risks involved with relying on our own capabilities to perform the tasks required by the post-market studies for ADASUVE, as well as with entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we enter into an arrangement with a third party or parties to perform the tasks required for the ADASUVE post-market studies and trials, the expense of such outsourcing could be significant, decreasing the profitability of ADASUVE. Additionally, any third party with whom we may collaborate may not fulfill its obligations or carry out activities sufficiently to satisfy FDA, EC, EMA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory authority standards, which could result in increased expenses needed to remediate any deficiencies or could even result in an FDA, EC, EMA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory authority enforcement action, including the imposition of civil money penalties and the withdrawal of approval of the product in the U.S. Finally, the data derived from any post-market study or trial could result in additional restrictions on the commercialization of ADASUVE through changes to the approved ADASUVE label, a more burdensome REMS program, the imposition of additional post-market studies or trials, or could even lead to the withdrawal of the approval of the product.\nIf we or any current or future collaborators fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, the EMA, the EC or other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, or previously unknown problems with any\nfuture products, suppliers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we or our collaborators could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the products, suppliers or manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u00b7\ninjunctions, consent decrees, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u00b7\nfines;\n\u00b7\nproduct seizures, detentions or import or export bans;\n\u00b7\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u00b7\nvariation, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nrequired variations of the clinical trial protocol\n\u00b7\nsuspension or termination of any clinical trials of the products;\n\u00b7\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u00b7\nrefusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications; and\n\u00b7\ndenial of permission to file an application or supplement in a jurisdiction.\nIf we or our current or future collaborators are subject to administrative or judicially-imposed sanctions arising out of enforcement of the FDA, EU or other applicable U.S. and foreign laws, it could impair our ability to manufacture and the ability of our current and future collaborators to successfully market ADASUVE, even if such an enforcement action does not relate specifically to ADASUVE. Such enforcement could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results.\nProblems with the third parties that manufacture the API in ADASUVE or our product candidates may delay our clinical trials or subject us to liability.\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of the API used in ADASUVE or any of our product candidates. We have no experience in API manufacturing, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of the APIs used in ADASUVE and our product candidates, on either a clinical or commercial scale. As a result, we rely on third parties to supply the API used in ADASUVE and each of our product candidates. We expect to continue to depend on third parties to supply the API for ADASUVE and our current and future product candidates and to supply the API for ADASUVE in commercial quantities.\nAn API manufacturer must meet high precision and quality standards for that API to meet regulatory specifications and comply with regulatory requirements. A contract manufacturer is subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. Additionally, a contract manufacturer must pass a pre-approval inspection by the FDA and corresponding foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP prior to the FDA\u2019s or corresponding foreign authorities\u2019 approval of any product candidate for marketing. A contract manufacturer\u2019s failure to conform to cGMP could result in a refusal by the FDA or a corresponding foreign authority to approve or a delay in their approval of a product candidate for marketing. We are ultimately responsible for confirming that the APIs used in ADASUVE and our product candidates are manufactured in accordance with applicable regulations.\nOur third-party suppliers may not carry out their contractual obligations or meet our deadlines. In addition, the API they supply to us may not meet our specifications and quality policies and procedures or they may not be able to supply the API in commercial quantities. If we need to find alternative suppliers of the API used in ADASUVE or any of our product candidates, we may not be able to contract for such supplies on acceptable terms, if at all. Any such failure to supply or delay caused by such contract manufacturers would have an adverse effect on our ability to continue clinical development of our product candidates or commercialize ADASUVE.\nIf our third-party drug suppliers fail to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in compliance with cGMP regulations, we could be subject to certain product liability claims in the event such failure to comply resulted in defective products that caused injury or harm.\nUnless our preclinical studies demonstrate an acceptable safety profile of our product candidates, we will not be able to pursue clinical development or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe must satisfy the FDA and other regulatory authorities abroad, through extensive preclinical studies, that our product candidates have an acceptable safety profile. Our Staccato system creates a condensation aerosol from drug compounds, and there currently are no approved products that use a similar method of drug delivery other than ADASUVE. Companies developing other inhalation products have not defined or successfully completed the types of preclinical studies we believe will be required for submission to regulatory authorities as we seek approval to conduct our clinical trials. We may not have conducted or may not conduct in the future the types of preclinical testing ultimately required by regulatory authorities, or future preclinical tests may indicate that our product candidates are not safe for use in humans. Preclinical testing is expensive, can take many years and has an uncertain outcome. In addition, success in initial preclinical testing does not ensure that later preclinical testing will be successful.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the preclinical testing process, which could delay or prevent our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u00b7\nour preclinical testing may produce inconclusive or negative safety results, which may require us to conduct additional preclinical testing or to abandon product candidates that we believed to be promising;\n\u00b7\nour product candidates may have unfavorable pharmacology, toxicology or carcinogenicity; and\n\u00b7\nour product candidates may cause undesirable side effects.\nAny such events would increase our costs and could delay or prevent our ability to conduct clinical testing and commercialize our product candidates, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure or delay in commencing or completing clinical trials for our product candidates could harm our business.\nOther than for ADASUVE, we have not completed all the clinical trials necessary to support an application with the FDA or other regulatory authorities abroad for approval to market any of our product candidates other than for ADASUVE in the United States and the European Union. Future clinical trials may be delayed or terminated as a result of many factors, including:\n\u00b7\ninsufficient financial resources to fund such trials;\n\u00b7\ndelays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites;\n\u00b7\nregulators, Ethics Committees or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nregulators, Ethics Committees or institutional review boards may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or concerns about patient safety;\n\u00b7\nwe may suspend or terminate our clinical trials if we believe that they expose the participating patients to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience slower than expected patient enrollment or lack of a sufficient number of patients who meet the enrollment criteria for our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\npatients may not complete clinical trials due to safety issues, side effects, dissatisfaction with the product candidate, or other reasons;\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, preventing us from collecting the data required by our study protocol;\n\u00b7\nproduct candidates may demonstrate a lack of efficacy during clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience governmental or regulatory delays, failure to obtain regulatory approval or changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines; and\n\u00b7\nwe may experience delays in our ability to manufacture clinical trial materials in a timely manner as a result of ongoing process and design enhancements to our Staccato system.\nAny delay in commencing or completing clinical trials for our product candidates could delay commercialization of our product candidates and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is possible that none of our product candidates will successfully complete clinical trials or receive regulatory approval, which would severely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our product candidates do not meet safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials, they will not receive regulatory approval, and we will be unable to market them.\nThe clinical development and regulatory approval process is extremely expensive and takes many years. Prior clinical trial program designs and results are not necessarily predictive of future clinical trial designs or results. Initial results may not be confirmed upon full analysis of the detailed results of a trial. Product candidates in later stage clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical trials with acceptable endpoints. Whether an approval will be granted, and the timing of such approval cannot be accurately predicted. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for ADASUVE in markets outside of the United States and the Ferrer Territories or for our other product candidates in any markets where we seek regulatory approval, we will be unable to market and sell them in those locations and therefore we may never be profitable.\nAs part of the regulatory process, we must conduct clinical trials for each product candidate to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA, the EC and other regulatory authorities abroad. The number and design of clinical trials that will be required varies depending on the product candidate, the condition being evaluated, the trial results and regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. In June 2008, we announced that our Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial of AZ-002 (Staccato alprazolam) for the treatment of panic disorder did not meet either of its two primary endpoints. In September 2009, we announced that our Phase 2b clinical trial of AZ-104 (Staccato loxapine, low-dose) for the treatment of migraine did not meet its primary endpoint.\nIf our product candidates fail to show a clinically significant benefit compared to placebo, they will not be approved for marketing.\nThe design of our clinical trials is based on many assumptions about the expected effect of our product candidates, and if those assumptions prove incorrect, the clinical trials may not produce statistically significant results. For example, in 2008 we released the preliminary results from our Phase 2a clinical trial with AZ-002 in patients with panic disorder, a separate indication from our current AZ-002 indication of ARS. The study did not meet its two primary endpoints, which were the effect of AZ-002 on the incidence of a doxapram-induced panic attack and the effect of AZ-002 on the duration of a doxapram-induced panic attack, both as compared with placebo. Our Staccato system is not similar to other approved drug delivery methods, and there is no precedent for the application of detailed regulatory requirements to our product candidates. We cannot assure you that the design of, or data collected from, the clinical trials of our product candidates will be sufficient to support the FDA, the EC and other foreign regulatory approvals.\nRegulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates even if they meet safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials.\nThe FDA, the EC and other foreign regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny marketing approval for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\na product candidate may not be considered to have a favorable risk-benefit ratio;\n\u00b7\nthe manufacturing processes or facilities we have selected may not meet the applicable requirements; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in their approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional work on our part.\nPart of the regulatory approval process includes compliance inspections of manufacturing facilities, processes, and products to ensure adherence to applicable regulations and guidelines. The regulatory agency may delay, limit or deny marketing approval of our other product candidates as a result of such inspections. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, approval for any of our product candidates could prevent us from ever generating meaningful revenues or achieving profitability.\nOur product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their endpoints in clinical trials. Regulatory agencies, including the FDA, the EMA, the EC or their advisors may disagree with our trial design and our interpretations of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Regulatory agencies may change requirements for approval even after a clinical trial design has been approved. For example, ADASUVE and our other product candidates combine drug and device components in a manner that the FDA considers to meet the definition of a combination product under FDA regulations. The FDA exercises significant discretion over the regulation of combination products, including the discretion to require separate marketing applications for the drug and device components in a combination product. ADASUVE and our product candidates are being regulated as drug products under the NDA process administered by the FDA. The FDA could in the future require additional regulation of ADASUVE or our product candidates under the medical device provisions of the FDCA. Our systems are designed to comply with cGMP and, where applicable, the QSR, which sets forth the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements for medical devices, and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. If we fail to comply with these regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRegulatory agencies also may approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies, such as the FDA\u2019s requirement that we perform a Phase 4 observational study and a study in adolescent patients for ADASUVE. Similarly, as a condition to the marketing authorization for ADASUVE in the EU, we were responsible for the conduct and funding of post-authorization studies, including (i) a benzodiazepine interaction study, which has been completed, (ii) a controlled study to determine ADASUVE\u2019s effect on cardiac rhythms, or a thorough QTc study, with two doses of ADASUVE, which has been completed, (iii) a clinical program designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADASUVE in agitated adolescent patients, (iv) an observational clinical study, and (v) a drug utilization study. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. As part of the transfer of the MAA to Ferrer in June 2015, Ferrer assumed responsibility for completing any outstanding studies\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and our clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, or we may be delayed in doing so.\nWe rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, academic institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We are responsible for confirming that our preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. The FDA and equivalent other country regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, for conducting and recording the results of our preclinical studies and with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, to assure that data and reported results are accurate and that the clinical trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities. If the third parties\nconducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, do not meet expected deadlines, fail to comply with the FDA or and equivalent other country regulatory authorities GLP or GCP regulations and standards, do not adhere to our clinical trial protocols or otherwise fail to generate reliable clinical data, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials.\nIf we experience problems with the manufacturers of components of ADASUVE or our product candidates, our ability to supply ADASUVE and our other product candidates will be impaired, our sales may be lower than expected and our development programs may be delayed and we may be subject to liability.\nWe outsource the manufacturing of the components of our Staccato system, including the printed circuit boards, the plastic airways, and the chemical heat packages to be used in our commercial single dose device. We have no experience in the manufacturing of components, other than our chemical heat packages, and we currently lack the resources and the capability to manufacture them, on either a clinical or commercial scale. As a result, we rely on third parties to supply these components. We expect to continue to depend on third parties to supply these components for ADASUVE and our current product candidates and any devices based on the Staccato system we develop in the foreseeable future.\nThe third-party suppliers of the components of our Staccato system must meet high precision and quality standards for our finished devices to comply with regulatory requirements. A contract manufacturer is subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure that our finished devices remain in strict compliance with the QSR, and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We are ultimately responsible for confirming that the components used in the Staccato system are manufactured in accordance with specifications, standards and procedures necessary to ensure that our finished devices comply with the QSR or other applicable regulations.\nOur third party suppliers may not comply with their contractual obligations or meet our deadlines, or the components they supply to us may not meet our specifications and quality policies and procedures. If we need to find alternative suppliers of the components used in the Staccato system, we may not be able to contract for such components on acceptable terms, if at all. Any such failure to supply or delay caused by such contract manufacturers would have an adverse effect on our ability to manufacture commercial quantities of ADASUVE and on our ability to continue clinical development of our product candidates or commercialize ADASUVE. In April 2014, we contracted with Autoliv to build two additional manufacturing cells, but we or a third party may not be able to use the cells to manufacture heat packages of sufficient quality, in sufficient quantity or at low enough cost to become profitable.\nIn addition, the heat packages used in the single dose version of our Staccato system are manufactured using certain energetic, or highly combustible, materials that are used to generate the rapid heating necessary for vaporizing the drug compound while avoiding degradation. Manufacture of products containing energetic materials is regulated by the U.S. government. We have entered into a manufacture agreement with Autoliv for the manufacture of the heat packages in the commercial design of our single dose version of our Staccato system. If Autoliv fails to manufacture the heat packages to the necessary specifications, or does not carry out its contractual obligations to supply our heat packages to us, or if the FDA requires different manufacturing or quality standards than those set forth in our manufacture agreement, our clinical trials or commercialization efforts may be delayed, suspended or terminated while we seek additional suitable manufacturers of our heat packages, which may prevent us from commercializing ADASUVE or our product candidates that utilize the single dose version of the Staccato system.\nIn the first quarter of 2015, Teva and Ferrer provided longer-term, ADASUVE orders, allowing us to manufacture ADASUVE in a consistent manner to take advantage of the efficiencies of continued batch production. During the third quarter of 2015, we completed all required ADASUVE production for Teva\u2019s and Ferrer\u2019s ADASUVE orders. As a result, we suspended our ADASUVE commercial manufacturing operations. We plan for ADASUVE commercial production to resume in the future as additional commercial product is required by Ferrer or any future collaborators. We may also consider contracting with third party manufacturers for ADASUVE units if deemed more efficient, including third-party manufacturers with multi-product facilities. We cannot predict when, if\never, we will begin to again commercially manufacture ADASUVE. If we do not restart our commercial manufacturing, we cannot predict if third-party manufacturers will be able to produce ADASUVE at a price which would allow us to generate profits.\nProduct candidates that we may develop may require expensive carcinogenicity tests.\nWe combine small molecule drugs with our Staccato system to create proprietary product candidates. Some of these drugs may not have previously undergone carcinogenicity testing that is now generally required for marketing approval. We may be required to perform carcinogenicity testing with product candidates incorporating drugs that have not undergone carcinogenicity testing or may be required to do additional carcinogenicity testing for drugs that have undergone such testing. Any carcinogenicity testing we are required to complete will increase the costs to develop a particular product candidate and may delay or halt the development of such product candidate.\nIf some or all of our patents expire, are invalidated or are unenforceable, or if some or all of our patent applications do not yield issued patents or yield patents with narrow claims, competitors may develop competing products using our or similar intellectual property and our business will suffer.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and trade secret protection for our technologies, ADASUVE and our product candidates both in the United States and other countries. We do not know whether any patents will issue from any of our pending or future patent applications. In addition, a third party may successfully circumvent our patents. Our rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or otherwise cover commercially valuable products or processes.\nThe degree of protection for our proprietary technologies, ADASUVE and our product candidates is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u00b7\nwe might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;\n\u00b7\nwe might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u00b7\nthe claims of our issued patents may be narrower than as filed and not sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from circumventing them;\n\u00b7\nit is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u00b7\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies or drug candidates that are patentable;\n\u00b7\nour patent applications or patents may be subject to interference, opposition or similar administrative proceedings;\n\u00b7\nany patents issued to us or our potential strategic collaborators may not provide a basis for commercially viable products or may be challenged by third parties in the course of litigation or administrative proceedings such as reexaminations or interferences; and\n\u00b7\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has developed regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, but many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, particularly the first inventor to file provisions, only became effective 18 months after its enactment. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and\nthe enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nEven if valid and enforceable patents cover ADASUVE, our product candidates and our technologies, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time.\nOur current patents or any future patents that may be issued regarding ADASUVE or our product candidates or methods of using them, can be challenged by our competitors who can argue that our patents are invalid and/or unenforceable. Third parties may challenge our rights to, or the scope or validity of, our patents. Patents also may not protect ADASUVE or our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making these or similar product candidates without legally infringing our patents. The FDCA and the FDA regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to challenge patent validity or create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug or device in order to facilitate the approval of generic substitutes. These same types of incentives encourage manufacturers to submit new drug applications that rely on literature and clinical data not prepared for or by the drug sponsor.\nOur potential strategic collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain patents is uncertain because, to date, some legal principles remain unresolved, there has not been a consistent policy regarding the breadth or interpretation of claims allowed in patents in the United States, and the specific content of patents and patent applications that are necessary to support and interpret patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal, scientific and factual issues. Furthermore, the policies governing pharmaceutical and medical device patents outside the United States may be even more uncertain. Changes in either patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. The employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors of our company and our strategic collaborators may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. Failure to protect or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nOur research and development collaborators may have rights to publish data and other information in which we have rights. In addition, we sometimes engage individuals or entities to conduct research that may be relevant to our business. The ability of these individuals or entities to publish or otherwise publicly disclose data and other information generated during the course of their research is subject to certain contractual limitations. These contractual provisions may be insufficient or inadequate to protect our trade secrets and may impair our patent rights. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information, then our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information may be jeopardized.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend time and money and could shut down some of our operations.\nOur commercial success depends in part on not infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products that are similar to ADASUVE or our product candidates, as well as methods of making or using similar or identical products. We are aware of certain pending U.S. patent applications related generally to a systemic respiratory delivery of loxapine. If these patent applications result in issued patents and we wish to use the claimed technology, we would need to obtain a license from the third party. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all.\nIn addition, administrative proceedings, such as interferences and reexaminations before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, could limit the scope of our patent rights. We may incur substantial costs and diversion of management and technical personnel as a result of our involvement in such proceedings. In particular, our patents and patent applications may be subject to interferences in which the priority of invention may be awarded to a third party. We do not know whether our patents and patent applications would be entitled to priority over patents or\npatent applications held by such a third party. Our issued patents may also be subject to reexamination proceedings. We do not know whether our patents would survive reexamination in light of new questions of patentability that may be raised following their issuance.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology or their proprietary products without authorization. In addition, third parties may already have or may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies or our products infringes these patents. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management and technical personnel in defending against any of these claims. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell any future products and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. In that event, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. In the event we cannot develop alternative methods or products, we may be effectively blocked from developing, commercializing or selling any future products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses would be expensive and could prevent us from commercializing any future products.\nWe review from time to time publicly available information concerning the technological development efforts of other companies in our industry. If we determine that these efforts violate our intellectual property or other rights, we intend to take appropriate action, which could include litigation. Any action we take could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical personnel in enforcing our patents or other intellectual property rights against others. Furthermore, the outcome of any action we take to protect our rights may not be resolved in our favor.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical industry is intense. If our competitors are able to develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less costly than ADASUVE or any future products that we may develop, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe face competition from established as well as emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than ADASUVE or any future products that we may develop and commercialize. In addition, significant delays in the development or commercialization of ADASUVE or our product candidates could allow our competitors to bring products to market before us and impair our ability to commercialize ADASUVE or our product candidates.\nWe anticipate that ADASUVE will compete with various injectable formulations of other antipsychotic and benzodiazepine drugs and oral, orally-disintegrating tablet and liquid formulations of other antipsychotic drugs and benzodiazepine drugs. Only the injectable antipsychotics are approved for the treatment of agitation.\nWe anticipate that, if approved, AZ-002 would compete with the oral tablet forms of alprazolam and possibly IV, oral and rectal forms of other benzodiazepines.\nWe anticipate that, if approved, AZ-007 would compete with non-benzodiazepine GABA-A receptor agonists, selective melatonin receptor agonists, orexin receptor antagonists or histamine (H1) receptor antagonists that are approved or in development. We are aware of more than 13 approved generic versions of zolpidem, or zaleplon, oral tablets, including one version of zolpidem intended to treat middle of the night awakening, that has been approved by the FDA. Additionally, we are aware of one product that completed Phase 2 development for the treatment of insomnia.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Established pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to discover quickly and develop novel compounds or drug delivery technology that could make ADASUVE or our product candidates obsolete. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through strategic collaborations with large and established companies. In addition, these third parties compete with\nus in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing, and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA or equivalent other country regulatory authorities\u2019 approval or discovering, developing and commercializing products before we do. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition will suffer.\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to develop or commercialize ADASUVE or our product candidates.\nWe are highly dependent on our President and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas B. King, the loss of whose services might adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. In addition, recruiting and retaining qualified clinical, scientific and engineering personnel to manage clinical trials of our product candidates and to perform future research and development work will be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. Although we believe we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, competition for experienced management and clinical, scientific and engineering personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms. In addition, we do not have employment agreements with any of our employees, and they could leave our employment at will. We have change of control agreements with our executive officers and vice presidents that provide for certain benefits upon termination or a change in role or responsibility in connection with a change of control of our company. We do not maintain life insurance policies on any employees. Failure to attract and retain personnel would prevent us from developing and commercializing ADASUVE and our product candidates.\nThe reduction of our workforce in 2015, and any future workforce and expense reductions, may have an adverse impact on our internal programs and may divert management attention.\nWe have substantially reduced the number of our executive and non-executive officers within the last 12 months. Additionally, the suspension of our ADASUVE commercial production included dismissal of a large number of our staff, some of whom had advanced or specialized skills. As a result, our headcount has decreased from 81 full-time employees at March 31, 2015 to approximately 27 full time employees at March 23, 2016. This workforce reduction was primarily implemented to preserve our capital resources and to manage our operating expenses. This workforce reduction may also limit our ability to complete our corporate objectives. We may also be required to implement further workforce and expense reductions in the future. Further workforce and expense reductions could result in reduced progress on our internal programs. In addition, employees, whether or not directly affected by a reduction, may seek future employment with our business partners or competitors. While our employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement at the time of hire, the confidential nature of certain proprietary information may not be maintained in the course of any such future employment. In addition, the implementation of expense reduction programs may result in the diversion of efforts of our executive management team and other key employees, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf plaintiffs bring product liability claims or lawsuits (including, but not limited to, consumer protection, mass tort or class actions) against us or our present and future collaborators, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of ADASUVE or product candidates that we may develop.\nAs the supplier of ADASUVE to Ferrer and any future collaborators, we are obligated to deliver commercial supply from a qualified manufacturing facility in accordance with certain specifications. In addition, we are obligated to supply ADASUVE free from product defects or manufacturing defects from our manufacture of ADASUVE. The development, manufacture, testing, marketing and sale of combination pharmaceutical and medical device products, like ADASUVE, entail significant risk of product liability claims, lawsuits (including, but not limited to consumer protection, mass tort or class actions), safety alerts or recalls. We may be held liable if any product we develop or manufacture causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable or unsafe during product design testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale, including, but not limited to quality issues, component failures, manufacturing flaws, unanticipated or improper uses of ADASUVE or any future products, design defects, inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information, or for unlawful, unfair or fraudulent competition or business practices relating to such products. Side effects of, or design or manufacturing defects in,\nthe products tested or commercialized by us or any collaborator could result in exacerbation of a clinical trial participant or patient\u2019s condition, serious injury or impairment, even death and/or out-of-pocket expenditures. This could result in product liability claims, lawsuits, safety alerts and/or recalls for ADASUVE or any future products, including those in clinical testing, to be commercialized, or already commercialized. Product liability claims or lawsuits may be brought by individuals seeking relief for themselves, by persons seeking to represent a class of claimants/plaintiffs, or by a large number of individual claimants in a coordinated or mass tort litigation or class action. We cannot predict the frequency, outcome, or cost to defend or resolve such product liability claims or lawsuits.\nWhile we have not had to defend against any product liability claims or other lawsuits to date, we face greater risk of product liability claims or lawsuits as we or any collaborator commercialize ADASUVE or other future products. As ADASUVE or any future product is more widely prescribed, we believe it is likely that product liability claims or lawsuits will eventually be brought against us. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, such claims or lawsuits may result in decreased demand for any products or product candidates that we may develop, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical trials, issuance of safety alerts, recall of products under investigation or already commercialized, costs and legal fees to defend and resolve litigation, injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits, or substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients, loss of revenue, and the inability to commercialize any products we develop. Safety alerts or recalls could result in the FDA or similar government agencies in the United States, or abroad, investigating or bringing enforcement actions regarding any products and/or practices, with resulting significant costs and negative publicity, all of which could materially adversely affect us.\nProduct liability insurance is expensive, can be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. We currently have product liability insurance that covers commercial product and clinical trials. Partly as a result of product liability lawsuits related to pharmaceutical and medical device products, product liability and other types of insurance have become more difficult and costly for pharmaceutical and medical device companies to obtain. Insurance may be prohibitively expensive, or may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Inability to maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims or lawsuits could impede or negatively affect the commercialization of ADASUVE or our product candidates. If we are sued for any injury caused by any product, our liability could exceed our insurance coverage and total assets. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers will pay for defense and indemnity of claims or lawsuits or that coverage will be adequate or otherwise available.\nA successful claim or lawsuit brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Such claims could also harm our reputation and the reputation of ADASUVE or any future products, adversely affecting our ability to develop and market any products successfully. In addition, defending a product liability claim or lawsuit is expensive and can divert the attention of key employees from operating our business.\nProduct recalls and safety alerts may be issued at our discretion or at the discretion of our suppliers, collaborators, government agencies, and other entities that have regulatory authority for medical device and pharmaceutical sales. Any recall of ADASUVE could materially adversely affect our business by rendering us unable to sell ADASUVE for some time, causing us to incur significant recall costs and by adversely affecting our reputation. A recall could also result in product liability claims.\nOur product candidate AZ-002 contains a drug substance that is regulated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Failure to comply with applicable regulations and requirements could harm our business.\nThe Controlled Substances Act imposes various registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, procurement and manufacturing quotas, labeling and packaging requirements, security controls and a restriction on prescription refills on certain pharmaceutical products. The DEA regulates drug substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest potential for abuse relative to the other schedules in the CSA. Alprazolam, the API in AZ-002, is regulated as a Schedule IV substance and zaleplon, the API in AZ-007, is regulated as a Schedule IV substance. AZ-002 and AZ-007 are subject to DEA regulations relating to registration, security, record keeping and reporting,\ndistribution and, if approved, physician prescription procedures, and DEA regulations may impact the availability of the scheduled substance available for clinical trials and commercial distribution. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations. Failure to comply with current and future regulations of the DEA could lead to a variety of sanctions, including revocation, or denial of renewal, of DEA registrations, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe single dose version of our Staccato system contains materials that are regulated by the U.S. government, and failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business.\nThe single dose version of our Staccato system uses energetic materials to generate the rapid heating necessary for vaporizing the drug, while avoiding degradation. Manufacture of products containing energetic materials is controlled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF. Technically, the energetic materials used in our Staccato system are classified as \u201clow explosives,\u201d and the ATF has granted us a license/permit for the manufacture of such low explosives. Additionally, due to inclusion of the energetic materials in our Staccato system, the United States Department of Transportation, or DOT, might regulate shipments of the single dose version of our Staccato system. However, the DOT has granted the single dose version of our Staccato system \u201cNot Regulated as an Explosive\u201d status. Failure to comply with the current and future regulations of the ATF or DOT could subject us to future liabilities and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, these regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or construct new facilities or could require us to incur other significant expenses in order to maintain compliance.\nWe use hazardous chemicals and highly combustible materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals. We also use energetic materials in the manufacture of the chemical heat packages that are used in our single dose devices. Our operations produce hazardous waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge or injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use of these materials and our liability may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.\nCertain of our suppliers are working with these types of hazardous and energetic materials in connection with our component manufacturing agreements. In the event of a lawsuit or investigation, we could be held responsible for any injury caused to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, these hazardous and energetic materials. Further, under certain circumstances, we have agreed to indemnify our suppliers against damages and other liabilities arising out of development activities or products produced in connection with these agreements.\nWe will need to implement additional systems, procedures and controls in the future as we grow and to satisfy new reporting requirements as a commercial entity.\nNumerous laws and regulations affect commercial companies, including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback, False Claims Act, the Federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. The rules make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as compared to the policies generally available to public companies. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as executive officers.\nCompliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback, False Claims Act, the Federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and other regulations will continue to increase our costs and require additional management resources. As we grow, we will need to continue to implement additional reporting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy new reporting requirements. We currently do not have an internal audit group. In addition, we may need to hire additional legal and accounting staff with appropriate\nexperience and technical knowledge, and we cannot assure you that if additional staffing is necessary that we will be able to do so in a timely fashion.\nOur business is subject to complex corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting requirements that could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state governments, the SEC, and the NASDAQ Capital Market. These entities have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act contains significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions, some of which the SEC, has implemented by adopting additional rules and regulations in areas such as the compensation of executives, referred to as \u201csay-on-pay.\u201d We cannot assure you that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations. If we fail to comply with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act and associated SEC rules, or any other regulations or if our interpretations of these rules and regulations differ from the regulating bodies, we could be subject to a range of consequences, including restrictions on our ability to sell equity securities or otherwise raise capital funds, the de-listing of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market, suspension or termination of our clinical trials, restrictions on future products or our manufacturing processes, significant fines, or other sanctions or litigation. Any of such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and the price of our common stock. Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities.\nOur facility is located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could damage our facility and equipment, which could cause us to curtail or cease operations.\nOur facility, which is the location where the final manufacturing of our product occurs, is located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and, therefore, is vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, such as power loss, fire, floods and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired. We currently may not have adequate insurance to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions, and we do not plan to purchase additional insurance to cover such losses due to the cost of obtaining such coverage. Any significant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result we manage a number of third party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, security breaches and other cyber attacks. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent the adverse effect of such events. Significant disruptions of our information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business. Such disruptions could also result in government investigations, fines, or penalties, and/or lawsuits directly or indirectly related to breach of data security, also adversely affecting our business.\nEU Member States and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the EU Data Protection Directive, as implemented into national laws by the EU Member States, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. Furthermore, there is a growth towards the public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU which adds to the complexity of processing health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, EMA disclosure initiatives, and voluntary commitments by industry. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the EU Data Protection Directive and national laws differently, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Moreover, guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. Failing to comply with these laws could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results. The EU Data Protection Directive prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area, or EEA, that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection. This includes the United States. A proposal for an EU Data Protection Regulation, intended to replace the current EU Data Protection Directive, is currently under consideration and, if adopted, could lead to additional and stricter requirements and penalties in the event of non-compliance.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo, or the DRC, and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for public companies that use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. We have determined that we use at least one of these conflict minerals in the manufacture of ADASUVE and our other product candidates, although we have not yet determined the source of the conflict minerals that we use. These new disclosure requirements require us to use diligent efforts to determine which conflict minerals we use and the source of those conflict minerals, and disclose the results of our findings. There are and will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including those costs incurred in conducting diligent efforts to determine which conflict minerals we use and the sources of conflict minerals used in ADASUVE and our other product candidates. Further, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in ADASUVE and our other product candidates. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free conflict minerals, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict free conflict minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. In addition, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that ADASUVE and our other product candidates contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in ADASUVE and our other product candidates through the procedures we may implement. If we determine to redesign ADASUVE and our other product candidates to not use conflict minerals, we would incur costs associated with doing so.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile.\nOur common stock price has experienced large fluctuations. In addition, the trading prices of life science and biotechnology company stocks in general have experienced extreme price fluctuations in recent years. The valuations of many life science companies without consistent product revenues and earnings are extraordinarily high based on conventional valuation standards, such as price to revenue ratios. These trading prices and valuations may not be sustained. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of life science or biotechnology companies could depress our stock price regardless of our results of operations. Other broad market and industry factors may decrease the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our performance. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions such as terrorism, military conflict, recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, also may decrease the trading price of our common stock. In addition, our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe success of the commercial launches of ADASUVE in the United States and the Ferrer Territories;\n\u00b7\nour and our collaborators\u2019 ability to complete and implement our post-approval commitments for ADASUVE;\n\u00b7\nthe process and outcome of our post-approval commitments for ADASUVE;\n\u00b7\nour ability to manufacture ADASUVE at a cost effective price;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated regulatory approvals or non-approvals of our product candidates or competing products;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated cash depletion of our financial resources;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated results and timing of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to ADASUVE or our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the expected or actual timing of our development programs such as for AZ-002, including delays or cancellations of clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nperiod to period fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of new technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nconditions or trends in the life science and biotechnology industries;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market valuations of other life science or biotechnology companies;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulations;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty, or increased costs, associated with replacing Autoliv as the supplier of chemical heat packages for ADASUVE and other product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock (or other securities) by us;\n\u00b7\nwhether or not we are successful in completing a strategic transaction, including the Transaction with Ferrer, and\n\u00b7\nsales and distributions of our common stock by our stockholders.\nIn the past, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation after periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. If a stockholder files a securities class action suit against us, we would incur substantial legal fees, and our management\u2019s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, existing common stockholders will experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may go down.\nWe will need to source additional capital to fund our operations to develop our product candidates. We may obtain such financing through the sale of our equity securities from time to time. As a result, our existing common stockholders will experience immediate dilution upon any such issuance. For example, in February 2012, we issued 4,400,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an additional 4,400,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering; in March 2012, we issued 241,936 shares of our common stock in a private placement to Ferrer; in July 2012 we issued 80,429 shares of our common stock to Azimuth in consideration for its execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement; in August and September 2012, we issued an aggregate of 3,489,860 shares of our common stock to Azimuth under the Purchase Agreement; in May 2013, we issued 1,437,481 shares of our common stock to Azimuth under the Purchase Agreement; in October 2014, we issued 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in a private placement to Ferrer; in September 2015 we issued 125,000 shares of our unregistered common stock to Ferrer pursuant to the Ferrer Note and a stock issuance agreement; and in February 2016 we issued 2,172,886 shares of our unregistered common stock to Teva pursuant to a stock issuance agreement as consideration for the reduction of the outstanding principal by $5 million, and the forgiveness of all accrued but unpaid interest, under the Teva Note. If we enter into other financing transactions in which we issue equity securities in the future, our existing common stockholders will experience immediate dilution upon any such issuance.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, we may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. To maintain the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others:\n\u00b7\na minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, and\n\u00b7\na market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10% or more stockholders) of at least $1 million and\nIn addition to the above requirements, we must meet at least one of the following requirements:\n\u00b7\nstockholders\u2019 equity of at least $2.5 million; or\n\u00b7\na market value of listed securities of at least $35 million; or\n\u00b7\nnet income from continuing operations of $500,000.\nOn June 19, 2015, we received a notice from The NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that our common stock had not met the $35 million market value of listed securities requirement for 30 consecutive business days and that, if we were unable to demonstrate compliance with this requirement during the applicable grace periods, our common stock would be delisted after that time. In accordance with the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, we have been provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days from the date the notice to regain compliance with the minimum market value of listed securities requirement. To regain compliance, the minimum market value of our common stock must meet or exceed $35 million for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the grace period. If we do not regain compliance during the 180 calendar day grace period, we may receive a delisting notification from The NASDAQ Stock Market. We may, at that time, request a hearing to remain on The NASDAQ Capital Market, which request will ordinarily suspend such delisting determination until a decision by The NASDAQ Stock Market subsequent to the hearing.\nOn December 17, 2015, we received notice from the NASDAQ Staff indicating that our common stock had not met the $35 million market value of listed securities requirement for 30 consecutive business days and that we did not regain compliance with this requirement within the 180 day grace period, and, accordingly, we would be subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market unless we timely requested a hearing before the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel, or the Panel, to review this determination.\nAdditionally, on January 20, 2016, we received a notice from The NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that our common stock does not meet the continued listing requirement as set forth in NASDAQ Rule 5550(a)(2) based on the closing bid price of our common stock for the preceding 30 business days. The minimum closing bid price required to maintain continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market is $1.00 per share. Under NASDAQ Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a 180 calendar day grace period from the date of the notice to regain compliance by meeting the continued listing standard. The continued listing standard will be met if our common stock has a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180 calendar day grace period. If we do not regain compliance within the 180 calendar day grace period, we will be afforded an additional 180 calendar day compliance period, provided that on the 180th day of the first grace period we (i) meet the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market (except for the bid price requirement) based on our most recent public filings and market information and (ii) notify NASDAQ of our intent to cure this deficiency.\nWe requested a hearing with NASDAQ to review our December 2015 delisting determination. This hearing occurred in February 2016. On March 7, 2016, the Panel issued a determination granting our request for the continued listing of our Common Stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Our continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market is subject to, among other things, evidence of our compliance with the minimum $35 million market value of listed securities requirement by June 14, 2016. In order to satisfy the market value of listed securities requirement, we must evidence a market capitalization of at least $35 million for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days on or before June 14, 2016. We are taking definitive steps to timely evidence compliance with the terms of the Panel\u2019s decision.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in providing timely evidence of compliance with the terms of the Panel\u2019s decision or otherwise maintaining our listing of the Common Stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market. If we are not successful in maintaining our listing, it could impair the liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, the delisting of our common stock from a national exchange could materially adversely affect our ability to access capital markets. As of March 23, 2016, the total market value of our publicly held shares of our common stock (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors, affiliates and 10% or more stockholders) was $10.7 million, the total market value of our listed securities was $12.2 million and the closing bid price of our common stock was $0.56 per share. As of December 31, 2015, we had a stockholders\u2019 deficit of $71.7 million.", "PERMNO": 91154, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ALXA"}
