Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, and the ultimate impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the scope and duration of the pandemic and the actions taken by governmental authorities, our clients and our business partners in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant deterioration in global macro-economic conditions has continued to impact our business. Considerable uncertainty continues to exist regarding the likely trajectory of the pandemic and the speed of the economic recovery, and\nthe ultimate impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the scope and duration of the pandemic, the actions that will be taken by governmental authorities to both contain the outbreak and to provide continuing support to affected businesses through additional stimulus funds and otherwise, the speed and efficiency of the vaccine roll out in New York state and nationally, and the ongoing response of and impact to our clients and business partners.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, causing businesses to shut down and unemployment rates to increase, has disrupted global supply chains, and has created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. In response to the pandemic, governmental and other authorities have instituted numerous measures to contain the virus including travel bans, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns.\nOur business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows will be impacted by factors which include, but are not limited to: the continued health and availability of our colleagues, continued dampened demand for our products and services, a prolonged period of low or near zero interest rates, a potential further deterioration in the financial condition of our clients resulting in an increase in our allowance for credit losses and the recognition of further credit losses, and a prolonged, deterioration of business conditions in our primary markets, particularly the New York Metro Market and the New York Suburban Market.\nWe have taken meaningful steps and precautions to safeguard the health and well-being of our colleagues. However, COVID-19 could still impact the availability and effectiveness of our colleagues as a result of illness, mandatory quarantines, mandated financial center closures or other reasons. If our employees are not able to work effectively or a substantial number of employees are unable to work, our business and financial result could be adversely affected.\nOur clients face a very challenging business environment. The current economic conditions, especially if prolonged, could negatively impact the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, cause an increase in the number of non-performing loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, and cause significant property damage, all of which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nThe pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in our ACL - loans to $326.1 million or 1.49% of total loans at December 31, 2020 versus $106.2 million or 0.50% at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately $165.0 million of the $251.7 million of provision for credit loss expense was recorded as a result of changes in the macro assumptions in our forecast model resulting from COVID-19 and the ensuing deterioration in macro-economic conditions. At December 31, 2020, loans criticized as special mention were $461.5 million and classified loans (substandard and doubtful) were $529.1 million. The collateral for these loans is mainly located in the New York Metro Market and includes office, retail, hotel and multi-family properties. At December 31, 2020, we had $208.4 million of loan payment deferral agreements with borrowers. The existing challenging business environment could deteriorate further or become prolonged, especially in our core markets, and this could have a material adverse effect on our loan portfolio and on our ACL - loans in future periods. Additionally, changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers may require us to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on the securities we hold in future periods, as well as reductions in other comprehensive income.\nThe New York Metro Market and the New York Suburban Market have been particularly impacted by COVID-19. Should the effects of the pandemic and related containment measures continue for an extended period of time, the demand for real estate in the New York City Metro Market may be negatively affected, impacting the value of collateral underlying our commercial real estate loan portfolio. A reduction in demand for commercial real estate would also likely impact our customers\u2019 ability to make loan payments in a timely and / or complete manner. As such, given our business concentration in the New York Metro Market and the New York Suburban Market, our results may be disproportionately impacted when compared to the results and financial condition of other banks or bank holding companies that do not operate in or have a geographic concentration in the New York Metro Market or the New York Suburban Market.\nThe volatility in global capital markets resulting from the pandemic and related business conditions may restrict our access to capital and/or increase our cost of capital.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks we face, including the other risks described below.\nWe continue to work with our stakeholders, including our colleagues, clients, and business partners, to assess, address and where possible mitigate the impact of the pandemic. However, the extent to which the pandemic will materially adversely affect our business and operating results will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to extensive regulatory oversight.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation, see Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Effect of Compliance with Supervision and Governmental Regulation.\u201d We are supervised and regulated by the FRB and the Bank is supervised and regulated by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, by the FDIC, as the insurer of its deposits, and by the CFPB, which has broad authority to regulate financial service providers and financial products. The application and administration of laws, rules and regulations may vary by such regulators.\nIn addition, we are subject to consolidated capital requirements and must serve as a source of strength to the Bank. As a result, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the DIF and our depositors, as well as other consumers, and not to benefit our stockholders. The regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes, all of which can have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. Our regulators have also intensified their focus on bank lending criteria and controls, and on the USA Patriot Act\u2019s anti-money laundering and the Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements, and there is increased scrutiny of our compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In order to comply with laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in the anti-money laundering area, we have been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems. We cannot be certain that the policies, procedures and systems we have in place to ensure compliance are without error, and there is no assurance that in every instance we are in full compliance with these requirements. In addition, emerging technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, could limit our ability to maintain compliance with applicable requirements to track the movement of funds.\nCompliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs, including by requiring additional compliance or other personnel and the implementation of additional internal controls. Further, we may incur compliance-related costs and our regulators may also consider our level of compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining our operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval we may make, even requests for approvals on unrelated matters. Further, changes in laws, regulations or regulatory policies could adversely affect the operating environment for the us in substantial and unpredictable ways, increase our cost of doing business, and impose new restrictions on the way in which we conduct our operations or adding significant operational constraints that might impair our profitability. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could result in a range of sanctions, legal proceedings and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil monetary penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders. In addition, the OCC and the FDIC have specific authority to take \u201cprompt corrective action,\u201d depending on our capital levels. For example, currently, we are considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for prompt corrective action purposes. If we were to be designated by the OCC as \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d we would become subject to additional restrictions and limitations, such as limits on the Bank\u2019s ability to take brokered deposits. If we were to be designated by the OCC in one of the lower capital levels (such as \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d), we would be required to raise additional capital and be subject to progressively more severe restrictions on our operations, and management, including the possible replacement of senior executive officers and directors and capital distributions, and, if we became \u201ccritically undercapitalized,\u201d to the appointment of a conservator or receiver.\nChanges in laws, government rules and regulations and monetary policy may have a material effect on our results of operations.\nFinancial institutions are subject to significant laws, rules and regulations and may be subject to further additional legislation, rulemaking or regulation in the future, none of which is within our control. Significant new laws, rules or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, rules or regulations, may cause our results of operations to differ materially. In addition, the costs and burden of compliance with such laws, rules and regulations continue to increase and could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for the Bank, as well as for our borrowers, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements. A material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on the Bank or our borrowers, and, as a result, our results of operations.\nBasel III capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, engage in share repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC adopted final rules for the Basel III capital framework that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules phased in over time, and became fully effective on January 1, 2019. The rules apply to us, as well as to the Bank, and require us to have a CET1 to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 to risk-weighted\nassets ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on our ability to pay dividends, engage in share repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses. These rules also establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory and other limitations, which may affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or to repurchase our common stock.\nWe are a separate legal entity from our subsidiary, the Bank, and we do not have significant operations of our own. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors that the Bank\u2019s regulators could assert that payment of dividends or other payments may result in an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, we are subjected to consolidated capital requirements and must serve as a source of strength to the Bank. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us or we are required to retain capital or contribute capital to the Bank, we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock or to repurchase shares of common stock.\nRisks Related to Accounting Matters\nChanges in accounting standards and management's application of those standards could materially impact the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nFrom time to time, FASB introduces changes to the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. For example, in June 2016 the FASB issued an accounting standard related to credit losses that became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. This standard replaced the incurred loss impairment methodology with an expected credit loss methodology and required consideration of a broader range of information to determine credit loss estimates. Implementation of the standard resulted in an increase to the ACL, with a corresponding negative impact to our stockholders\u2019 equity at adoption. We elected an interim regulatory capital rule that allows us to delay for two years an estimate of the effect on regulatory capital of the CECL Standard, relative to the incurred loss methodology, followed by a three-year transition period. It is possible that our reported earnings and lending activity will be negatively impacted in future periods as a result of this accounting standard.\nChanges in the value of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings.\nWe account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with GAAP, which, in general, requires that goodwill not be amortized, but rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, and further requires us to recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is performed annually and involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. Changes in the local and national economy, the federal and state legislative and regulatory environments for financial institutions, the stock market, interest rates and other external factors (such as natural disasters or significant world events) which can be highly unpredictable, and may materially impact the fair value of publicly traded financial institutions, such as us, and could result in an impairment charge at a future date.\nThe need to account for assets at market prices may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe report certain assets, including investments and securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices, when available, or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their fair value, we may incur losses even if the assets in question present minimal credit risk. In addition, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods with respect to securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.\nRisks Related to Our Lending Activities\nAn inadequate ACL - loans would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to agreed upon terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans will not be sufficient to avoid losses. Credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Volatility and deterioration in the broader economy may also increase our risk of credit losses. The determination of an appropriate level of ACL - loans is an inherently uncertain process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond our control, and charge-offs may exceed current estimates. We evaluate the collectability of our loan portfolio and record an ACL - loans that we believe is adequate to absorb potential losses over the expected life of the loans based upon various factors, including, but not limited to: the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans; previous loan loss experience;\nspecific loans that have loss potential; delinquency trends; the estimated fair market value of the collateral; current economic conditions; the views of our regulators; and geographic and industry loan concentrations. If any of our evaluations are incorrect and/or borrower defaults result in losses exceeding our ACL - loans, our results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our ACL - loans will be adequate to cover actual loan losses realized on our portfolio.\nCommercial real estate, commercial & industrial and ADC loans expose us to increased risk and earnings volatility.\nWe consider our CRE loans, C&I loans and ADC loans to be higher risk categories in our loan portfolio because these loans are particularly sensitive to economic conditions. At December 31, 2020, our portfolio of CRE loans, including multi-family loans, totaled $10.2 billion, or 46.9% of portfolio loans, our C&I loans (including traditional commercial & industrial, asset-based lending, payroll finance, warehouse lending, factored receivables, equipment finance and public sector finance) totaled $9.2 billion, or 41.9% of portfolio loans, and our ADC loans totaled $642.9 million, or 2.9% of portfolio loans.\nCRE loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than residential loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend on the successful operation and management of the businesses that hold the loans, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower\u2019s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation. In the case of C&I loans, although we strive to maintain high credit standards and limit exposure to any one borrower, the collateral for these loans often consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. This type of collateral typically does not yield substantial recovery in the event we need to foreclose on it and may rapidly deteriorate, disappear, or be misdirected in advance of foreclosure. This adds to the potential that our charge-offs will be more volatile than we participated, which could significantly negatively affect our earnings in any quarter. In addition, some of our ADC loans pose higher risk levels than expected at origination, as projects may stall or sell at prices lower than anticipated. In addition, many of our borrowers also have more than one CRE, C&I or ADC loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship may expose us to significantly greater risk of loss.\nContinued concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase our risk.\nOur success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the markets in which we conduct most of our business. The economic conditions in these areas may be different from, and in some instances worse than, the economic conditions in the United States as a whole. Most of our loans and deposits are generated from customers primarily in the New York Metro Market, which includes Manhattan, the boroughs and Long Island, and certain portions of the New York Suburban Market including Rockland, Westchester and Orange Counties in New York. We also have a presence in Ulster, Sullivan and Putnam Counties in New York and in Bergen County, New Jersey, as well as other counties in northern New Jersey. Our expansion into New York City and continued growth in Westchester County and Bergen County has helped us diversify our geographic concentration with respect to our lending activities but deterioration in economic conditions in our market area would still adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLoans in our residential mortgage loan portfolio include interest only loans and loans that were originated as interest only loans that have converted to principal amortization status.\nAt December 31, 2020, included in our residential mortgage loan portfolio were $599.5 million of interest only loans and other residential mortgage loans that have converted to principal amortization status. After conversion to principal amortization status, a borrower\u2019s monthly payment may increase substantially and the borrower may not be able to meet the increased debt service, which could result in increased delinquencies and, accordingly, potentially adversely affect our operating results. At December 31, 2020, there were $8.8 million of loans that are interest only or that were interest only and have converted to principal amortization status that were in non-accrual status.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nChanges in market interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates. Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. In general, our balance sheet is modestly asset sensitive because our assets mature or re-price at a faster pace than our liabilities. If interest rates continue at existing levels or decline, net interest income would be adversely affected as asset yields would be expected to decline at faster rates than deposit or borrowing costs. A decline in net interest income may also occur if competitive market pressures limit our ability to reduce deposit costs. Wholesale funding costs may also increase at a faster pace than asset re-pricing.\nWe also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and securities. Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and securities, as borrowers refinance their\nloans to reduce borrowings costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities. Conversely, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our interest earning assets and, in particular, our securities portfolio. The Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate two times in fiscal year 2020. Generally, the value of our securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $2.3 billion. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale could have an adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity and comprehensive income.\nUncertainty relating to LIBOR calculation process and phasing out of LIBOR could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cUK FCA\u201d), announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. In November 2020, the UK FCA announced it will consult on its proposal to extend the retirement date of certain offered rates (excluding the one week and two month LIBOR offered rates which otherwise ease after December 31, 2021); and that, the publication of the remaining LIBOR offered rates will continue until June 30, 2023. Given consumer protection, litigation, and other risks, the bank regulatory agencies encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.\nIt is not possible to predict what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. In particular, regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fall-back language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or SOFR as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and could present additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers and internally could adversely impact our reputation financial condition and results of operations. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur outstanding debt obligations and preferred stock, and our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and to meet our obligations under our existing indebtedness.\nWe have approximately $1.0 billion in outstanding indebtedness and obligations related to outstanding preferred stock. Our existing debt, together with any future additional indebtedness incurred, and outstanding preferred stock, could have important consequences for our creditors and stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022restrict us from paying dividends to our stockholders; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions.\nOur results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising from certain foreclosure practices.\nForeclosure timelines in our principal marketplace are longer than the national average. Residential mortgages, in particular, may present us with foreclosure process issues. For example, residential mortgages were 7.4% of our total portfolio loans as of December 31, 2020, but constituted 11.2% of our non-accrual loans on the same date. Collateral for many of our residential loans is located within the States of New York and New Jersey, where there may continue to be foreclosure process and timeline issues.\nWe are subject to competition from both banks and non-bank companies.\nThe financial services industry, including commercial banking, is highly competitive, and we face competition for deposits, loans and other financial services. Our principal competitors include commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations, mutual funds, money market funds, finance companies, trust companies, insurers, leasing companies, credit unions, mortgage companies, REITs, private issuers of debt obligations, venture capital firms, private equity funds and suppliers of other investment alternatives, such as securities firms. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are and thus have advantages over us in providing certain services. Further, many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater access to capital and other resources.\nIn addition, financial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. The adoption of new technologies, including Internet banking services, mobile applications, advanced ATM functionality and cryptocurrencies could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our current products and services or to build new products and services. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important and may be costly, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that regulators will not provide the requisite approvals.\nWe will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and may from time to time make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks, branches, financial institutions, or related businesses that we expect will further our business strategy, including through participation in FDIC-assisted acquisitions or assumption of deposits from troubled institutions. Any potential acquisition will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner or at all. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, these acquisitions could involve numerous risks, including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs, difficulties related to integration, difficulties and costs associated with consolidation, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business activities, changes in relationships with customers, and the potential loss of key employees. In addition, we may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates or preventing deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions. Additionally, we may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive terms. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing or will even pursue future acquisitions, or if such transactions are completed, that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. Our ability to grow may be limited if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future.\nThe success of our and the Bank\u2019s mergers and acquisition transactions may depend, in part, on our ability to realize the estimated cost savings from combining the acquired businesses with our and the Bank\u2019s existing operations. It is possible that the potential cost savings could turn out to be more difficult to achieve than anticipated or that our estimates could turn out to be incorrect and that anticipated cost savings may not be realized fully or at all, and/or may take longer to realize than expected. Moreover, although we have successfully integrated business acquisitions in recent years, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future, which could delay or prevent the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions from being realized fully or at all. Finally, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading value and thus may result in the dilution of our book value per share.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or incident involving the mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties). For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches.\nVarious state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification requirements in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to ensure that all of our customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject us to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nFurther concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose customers or potential customers and thereby reduce our revenues.\nA breach, failure or interruption of information security and other systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents, could negatively affect our earnings or otherwise harm our business.\nIncreasingly, our data processing, communication and information exchange depends on a variety of computing platforms and networks, both internal and those of external, third-party vendors. We devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business continuity programs and otherwise. But there can be no assurance that our systems will not experience a breach interruption in service or other failure. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events, all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions continue to increase in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers continue to engage in attacks against large financial institutions including denial of service attacks designed to disrupt external customer facing services, and ransomware attacks designed to deny organizations access to key internal resources or systems. Moreover, we are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection. Additionally, we face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with our own and third-party systems, processes and data, including credit card transactions that typically require the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and our processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them.\nWhile to date we have not been the target of a successful, material cyber-attack, breach or other incidents, we cannot guarantee that our systems, or the systems of the third-party vendors we rely on, are free from vulnerability to attack, despite safeguards we and our third-party vendors have instituted.\nWhile we diligently assess applicable regulatory and legislative developments affecting our business, laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity have been frequently changing, imposing new requirements on us, such as the recently adopted New York State Department of Financial Services\u2019 Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies regulation. In light of this, we face the potential for additional regulatory scrutiny that will lead to increasing compliance and technology expenses and, in some cases, could constrain our plans for growth and other strategic objectives.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. In particular, we rely on the leadership of our Chief Executive Officer, Jack Kopnisky, and our Chief Financial Officer, Luis Massiani, who was also recently appointed Chief Operating Officer. The loss of service of Mr. Kopnisky, Mr. Massiani or one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to\nsuccessfully implement our long-term business strategy, could cause our business to suffer, and could negatively impact the value of our common stock. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, such as the previously-announced upcoming transition of Bea Ordonez to the role of Chief Financial Officer, and we cannot predict whether resignations of key personnel will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and our markets and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other executive officers have entered into employment agreements with us, it is possible that they may not complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration. Our success also depends on the experience of our financial center managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. Further, the loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated or at all and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe invest in certain tax-advantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects and other community development initiatives. Our investments in these projects rely on the ability of the projects to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits. We face the risk that tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance with relevant requirements at the project level, may not be able to be realized. The risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits associated with a particular project depends on many factors that are outside our control. A project\u2019s failure to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits may have a negative impact on our investment and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86582, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "STL"}
