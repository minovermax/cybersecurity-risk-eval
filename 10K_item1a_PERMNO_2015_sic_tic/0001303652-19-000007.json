RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision. While we believe that the risks and uncertainties described below are the material risks currently facing us, additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also arise and materially affect our business. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nDue to our growth, we have a limited operating history at our current scale, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe have a relatively short history operating our business at its current scale. We continue to increase the number of our employees and expand our operations worldwide. Furthermore, we operate in an industry that is characterized by rapid technological innovation, intense competition, changing customer needs and frequent introductions of new products, technologies and services. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in evolving industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in the market, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer.\nOur future success will depend in large part on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmanage the transition to a subscription-based business model successfully;\n\u2022\nimprove the performance and capabilities of our software;\n\u2022\ncompete with other companies, custom development efforts and open source initiatives that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the market for our software;\n\u2022\nincrease the number and value of enterprise sales transactions;\n\u2022\nmaintain and improve the security, governance and compliance of our software technology and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nexpand the availability of our software on public cloud service providers;\n\u2022\nhire, integrate, train and retain skilled talent, including members of our direct sales force and software engineers;\n\u2022\nmaintain and expand our business, including our operations, infrastructure and processes to support our growth, both domestically and internationally;\n\u2022\nexpand our customer base, both domestically and internationally;\n\u2022\nrenew maintenance and subscription agreements with, and sell additional products to, existing customers, including enterprise customers;\n\u2022\nprice and package our product and service offerings successfully;\n\u2022\nmaintain high customer satisfaction and ensure quality and timely releases of our products and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and support our indirect sales channels and strategic partner network;\n\u2022\nincrease market awareness of our products and enhance our brand; and\n\u2022\nmaintain compliance with applicable governmental regulations and other legal obligations, including those related to intellectual property, data protection and privacy, security, international sales and taxation.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this \"Risk Factors\" section, our business will be adversely affected and our results of operations will suffer.\nIf we fail to successfully manage the transition to a subscription-based business model, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe are currently transitioning to a more subscription-based business model. In April 2018, we introduced role-based subscription offerings to help organizations scale analytics. Tableau Creator, Explorer and Viewer subscriptions each provide tailored combinations of our products' analytical capabilities that are designed for different user needs, from sophisticated analysts to casual users. It is still uncertain whether this transition will\nprove successful or whether we will be able to develop this business model more quickly than our competitors. Market acceptance of our product and service offerings will be dependent on our ability to (1) continue to innovate and include new functionality and improve usability of our products in a manner that addresses our customers' needs and requirements, and (2) optimally price our products in light of marketplace conditions, competition, our costs and customer demand. This transition may have negative revenue and/or cash flow implications. If we are unable to effectively meet these challenges, our business could be harmed.\nThis subscription strategy may give rise to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nour revenues and cash flows may fluctuate more than anticipated as a result of this strategy;\n\u2022\nif new or current customers desire only perpetual licenses, our subscription sales may lag behind our expectations;\n\u2022\nthe shift to a subscription strategy may raise concerns among our customer base, including concerns regarding changes to pricing over time and our ability to provide maintenance services including timely upgrades, updates and enhancements;\n\u2022\nwe may be unsuccessful in maintaining or implementing our target pricing or new pricing models, product adoption and projected renewal rates, or we may select a target price or new pricing model that is not optimal and could negatively affect our sales or earnings;\n\u2022\nour customers have and may continue to shift purchases to our lower priced subscription offerings, which could negatively affect our financial results;\n\u2022\nour shift to a subscription licensing model may result in confusion among new or existing customers (which can slow adoption rates), partners, resellers and investors;\n\u2022\nif our customers do not renew their subscriptions, our revenue may decline and our business may suffer;\n\u2022\nour relationships with existing partners that resell perpetual license products may be damaged; and\n\u2022\nwe may incur sales compensation costs at a higher than forecasted rate if the pace of our subscription transition is faster than anticipated.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from a limited number of software products.\nWe currently derive and expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from our Tableau Desktop, Tableau Server and Tableau Online software products. In April 2018, we released Tableau Prep, a new data preparation product that integrates directly into the Tableau analytical workflow. The continued growth in market demand of these software products, along with our ability to rapidly innovate and introduce new products to contribute to our revenues, is critical to our continued success. Demand for our software is affected by a number of factors, including continued market acceptance of our products, our ability to effectively introduce new products and features, the timing of development and release of new products by our competitors, price or product packaging changes by us or by our competitors, technological change, growth or contraction in the traditional and expanding business analytics market and general economic and political conditions and trends. If our competitors offer products or functionality similar to ours at more attractive prices, we may have to reduce our prices, which may cause our revenues to decline. Further, if we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance of our software, or we cannot successfully meet our customers' needs or innovate and deliver additional products or features in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our results of operations and competitive position will suffer.\nWe spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new software and enhanced versions of our existing software to incorporate additional features, improve functionality, function in concert with new technologies or changes to existing technologies and allow our customers to analyze a wide range of data sources and work with different kinds of data sets. For example, in April 2018, we released Tableau Prep, a new data preparation product that integrates directly into the Tableau analytical workflow. We also invest in acquiring and integrating new technologies to continue to improve our platform. For example, in January 2018, we released Hyper, our in-memory data engine, which was a significant upgrade to our existing Hybrid Data Architecture.\nWhen we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product, we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market, promote and sell the new offering. Therefore, when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products, such as Tableau Prep or Hyper, they must achieve high levels\nof market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in acquiring and integrating, developing and bringing them to market.\nWe may make changes to our software that our customers do not find useful. We may also discontinue certain features or products, begin to charge for certain features that are currently free or increase fees for any of our features or usage of our software. We may also face problems or challenges in connection with new product or feature introductions, including our ability to innovate and our ability to execute and deliver new products and new features in a timely manner.\nOur new products or product enhancements and changes to our existing software could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to predict market demand accurately in terms of software functionality and capability or to supply software that meets this demand in a timely fashion;\n\u2022\ninability to operate effectively with the technologies, systems or applications of our existing or potential customers;\n\u2022\ndefects, errors or failures;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity about their performance or effectiveness;\n\u2022\ndelays in releasing our new software or enhancements to our existing software to the market, due to, among other things, our failure to execute in a timely manner on our development roadmap;\n\u2022\nthe introduction or anticipated introduction of competing products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nan ineffective sales force;\n\u2022\npoor business conditions for our end-customers, causing them to delay purchases; and\n\u2022\nthe reluctance of customers to purchase software incorporating open source software.\nIn addition, because our products are designed to operate on and with a variety of systems, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in technology. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion.\nIf our new software or enhancements and changes do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position will be impaired, and our revenues could decline. The adverse effect on our results of operations may be particularly acute because of the significant research, development, marketing, sales and other expenses we will have incurred in connection with the development and release of new software or enhancements.\nWe face intense competition, and we may not be able to compete effectively, which could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business, growth, revenues and market share.\nThe market for our products is intensely and increasingly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. In addition, many companies in our target market are offering, or may soon offer, products and services that may compete with our products.\nOur current primary competitors generally fall into the following categories:\n\u2022\nlarge technology companies, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, and/or cloud-based offerings that provide one or more capabilities that are competitive with our products, such as Amazon.com, Inc., Google, IBM, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, salesforce.com, inc. and SAP SE;\n\u2022\nbusiness analytics software companies, such as MicroStrategy, Qlik and TIBCO Spotfire (a subsidiary of TIBCO Software Inc.); and\n\u2022\nproviders of SaaS-based or cloud-based analytics products.\nIn addition, we may compete with open source initiatives and custom development efforts. We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the broader business analytics software market, including data preparation and data cataloging, as customer requirements evolve and as new products and technologies are introduced such as artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. We expect this to be particularly true with respect to our SaaS-based offering. This is a relatively new and evolving area of business analytics solutions, and we anticipate competition to increase based on customer demand for these types of products.\nMany of our competitors, particularly the large software companies named above, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, professional services or other resources\nand greater name recognition than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business analytics industry. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, for example by offering and expanding capabilities of SaaS-based products that compete with our on-premises products and our SaaS product offerings, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. Moreover, many of these competitors are bundling their analytics products into larger deals or maintenance renewals, often at significant discounts. Increased competition may lead to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products available for free or a nominal price, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed if we fail to meet these competitive pressures.\nOur ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of factors, both within and outside of our control. Some of these factors include our ability to rapidly innovate and effectively execute to bring new products or features to the marketplace in a timely manner, and continue to develop and expand our products discovery and visualization capabilities, analytical and statistical capabilities, and performance and scalability. In addition, our ability to compete successfully depends on the quality and reliability of our maintenance, customer service and support, the value we provide to customers, and continuing to develop and enhance our overall brand recognition. Any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or other areas may reduce the demand for our products, as well as adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMoreover, current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others. By doing so, these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our customers or potential customers. In addition, our current or prospective indirect sales channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors. These relationships may limit our ability to sell or certify our products through specific distributors, technology providers, database companies and distribution channels and allow our competitors to rapidly gain significant market share. These developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from existing and new customers and to maintain maintenance services revenues from our existing and new customers. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur success depends on increasing the number and value of enterprise sales transactions, which typically involve a longer sales cycle, greater deployment challenges and additional support and services than sales to individual purchasers of our products.\nGrowth in our revenues and achieving profitability depends in part on our ability to complete more and larger enterprise sales transactions. During 2018, we closed 1,749 sales transactions greater than $100,000 compared to 1,593 sales transactions greater than $100,000 in 2017, representing a 10% increase in the number of sales transactions greater than $100,000. This metric is impacted by our transition to a more subscription-based business model as the unit sales prices of term and subscription licenses are lower than comparable perpetual licenses. These larger transactions may involve significant customer negotiation and are typically completed near the end of the quarter. Enterprise customers may undertake a significant evaluation process, which can last from several months to a year or longer. For example, in recent periods, excluding renewals, many of our transactions over $100,000 have generally taken over three months to close. Any individual transaction may take substantially longer than three months to close. Events may occur during this period that affect the size or timing of a purchase or even cause cancellations, which may lead to greater unpredictability in our business and results of operations. We will spend substantial time, effort and money on enterprise sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales.\nWe may also face unexpected deployment challenges with enterprise customers or more complicated installations of our software platform. It may be difficult to deploy our software platform if the customer has unexpected database, hardware or software technology issues. Additional deployment complexities may occur if a customer hires a third party to deploy or implement our products or if one of our indirect sales channel partners leads the implementation of our products. In addition, enterprise customers may demand more configuration and integration services, which increase our upfront investment in sales and deployment efforts, with no guarantee that these customers will increase the scope of their use. As a result of these factors, we must devote a significant amount of sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, increasing the cost and time required to complete sales. Any difficulties or delays in the initial implementation, configuration or integration of\nour products could cause customers to reject our software or lead to the delay in or failure to obtain future orders, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to sustain or increase our revenue growth rate, the growth rate of our customer base or achieve profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in recent periods. We expect expenses to continue to increase as we make investments in our sales and marketing and research and development organizations, expand our operations and infrastructure both domestically and internationally and develop new products and new features for and enhancements of our existing products.\nMoreover, as we grow our business, we expect our revenue growth rates to continue to fluctuate in future periods due to a number of reasons, which may include slowing demand for our products, shifts in customer demand and spending on licenses for our products, shifts in sales of subscription-based versus perpetual licenses, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities, the maturation of our business or the decline in the number of organizations into which we have not already expanded. For all these reasons, we also cannot assure that our customer base will continue to grow at the same rate, or at all.\nAdditionally, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, computed in accordance with the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, as compared to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, computed in accordance with ASC 605, were positively impacted by our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard effective January 1, 2018. For example, prior to our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, we historically recognized revenue related to on-premises term license agreements ratably over the term of the licensing agreement. Under the new revenue recognition standard, revenue allocable to the license portion of the arrangement is recognized upon delivery of the license. Accordingly, our historical results or revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We have included financial results during 2018 under ASC 605 for comparison to the prior year. Beginning in 2019, financial results for 2019 and future years will not be presented on an ASC 605 basis.\nInterruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure, including those caused by cyber-attacks, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, performance issues due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website or third-party hosting disruptions or capacity constraints due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, cyber-attacks, security incidents, natural disasters or fraud. If our product or corporate security is compromised, our website is unavailable or our users are unable or unwilling due to performance problems to download our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business could be negatively affected. Moreover, if our security measures, products or services are subject to cyber-attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our website, Tableau Online, or other products or services, our products or services may be perceived as insecure, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure. In particular, our cloud-based products, Tableau Online and Tableau Public, may be especially vulnerable to interruptions, performance problems or cyber-attacks. We continue to invest in the personnel, infrastructure and software solutions necessary to mitigate these risks. However, if we are unable to attract and retain personnel with the necessary cybersecurity expertise, or implement sufficient safeguarding measures, we may not be able to prevent all potentially disruptive events which could occur in the future. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these events within an acceptable period of time. Our cloud-based products are hosted at third-party data centers that are not under our direct control. If these data centers were to be damaged or suffer disruption, our ability to provide these products to our customers could be impaired and our reputation could be harmed, and we may face legal action over the disruption, as well as incur additional compliance and information security costs to mitigate future disruptions. Moreover, if a significant security breach occurs with respect to an industry peer, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the security of business intelligence or analytics platforms in general, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones.\nIn addition, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our website performance, especially during peak usage times and as our software becomes more complex and our user traffic increases. Adverse consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in level of customer support, and impaired quality of users' experiences, and could result in customer dissatisfaction and the loss of existing customers. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve website performance and security and to enable rapid and secure releases of new features and\napplications for our software. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe also rely on SaaS technologies from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including financial management services from NetSuite Inc. and customer relationship management services from salesforce.com, inc. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions, security vulnerabilities or cyber-attacks, or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonably terms or prices, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage these critical functions could be interrupted, we may not be able to report our financial results timely, and our processes for managing sales of our software and supporting our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, bugs or security flaws in our software could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nBecause our software is complex, undetected errors, failures, bugs or security flaws may occur, especially when new versions or updates are released. Our software is often installed and used in large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures of our software or other aspects of the computing environment into which it is deployed. In addition, deployment of our software into computing environments may expose undetected errors, compatibility issues, failures, bugs or security flaws in our software. Despite testing by us, errors, failures, bugs or security flaws may not be found in our software until it is released to our customers. Moreover, our customers could incorrectly implement or inadvertently misuse our software, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely impact the perceived utility of our products as well as our brand. Any of these real or perceived errors, compatibility issues, failures, bugs or security flaws in our software could result in negative publicity, reputational harm, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our software, loss of competitive position or claims by customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem. Alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we are unable to identify, attract, integrate and retain additional qualified personnel, including executive, top sales and technical talent, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to identify, attract, integrate and retain highly skilled executive, technical, managerial and other personnel in our sales, marketing, operations and development groups. If we do not successfully integrate these or other new hires, it could impede or negatively impact our business operations and strategic direction including our sales execution, marketing and product development planning and implementation processes. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous other companies, including other software and technology companies, many of whom have greater financial and other resources than we do. These companies also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than those we have to offer. In addition, new hires often require significant training and, in many cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. We may incur significant costs to attract and retain qualified personnel, including significant expenditures related to salaries and benefits and compensation expenses related to equity awards, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. Moreover, new employees may not be or become as productive as we expect, as we may face challenges in adequately or appropriately integrating them into our workforce and culture. In addition, as we move into new geographies, we will need to attract and recruit skilled personnel in those areas. We may face additional challenges in attracting, integrating and retaining international employees. If we are unable to attract, integrate and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing technical, operational, sales and managerial requirements, as well as executive leadership requirements, on a timely basis or at all, our business will be adversely affected.\nVolatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. Certain senior management personnel and other key employees are vested in a substantial amount of stock or stock options. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of\nthe shares or the exercise prices of the options, or, conversely, if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the market price of our common stock or the market price of our common stock decreases significantly, impacting the value of their unvested restricted stock unit awards. If we are unable to appropriately incentivize and retain our employees through equity compensation, or if we need to increase our compensation expenses in order to appropriately incentivize and retain our employees, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends in large part on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key personnel. In particular, the leadership of key management personnel is critical to the successful management of our company, our ability to innovate and execute in the development and release of new products and features and our overall strategic direction. Our senior management and key personnel are all employed on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time, for any reason and without notice. The loss of any of our key management personnel could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and adversely affect our business. We do not maintain \"key person\" insurance for any member of our senior management team or any of our other key employees.\nAs customers demand products that provide business analytics delivered via a SaaS model, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that companies have begun to expect that key software be provided through a SaaS model. We have used and expect to use our current cash or future cash flows to fund further development of our Tableau Online product, and we may encounter difficulties that cause our costs to exceed our current expectations. Moreover, as demand increases, we will need to make additional investments in related infrastructure such as public cloud platforms, data centers, network bandwidth and technical operations personnel. All of these investments could negatively affect our operating results. Even if we make these investments, we may be unsuccessful in achieving significant market acceptance of this product. Moreover, sales of current or future SaaS offerings by our competitors could adversely affect sales of all of our existing products. In addition, increasing sales of our SaaS offering could cannibalize license sales of our on-premises offerings to our existing and prospective customers, which could negatively impact our overall sales growth. The migration of our customers to a SaaS model would also change the manner in which we recognize revenue, which could adversely affect our operating results and business operations.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to further penetrate the existing market for business analytics software as well as the growth and expansion of that market.\nAlthough the overall market for business analytics software is well-established, the market for business analytics software like ours is relatively new, rapidly evolving and unproven. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to further penetrate the existing market for business analytics software, as well as the continued growth and expansion of what we believe to be an emerging market for analytics solutions and platforms that are faster, easier to adopt, easier to use and more focused on self-service capabilities. It is difficult to predict customer adoption and renewal rates, customer demand for our products, the size, growth rate and expansion of these markets, the entry of competitive products or the success of new or existing competitive products. Our ability to further penetrate the existing market and any expansion of the emerging market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with our products, as well as customers' willingness to adopt a different approach to data analysis. Furthermore, many potential customers have made significant investments in legacy business analytics software systems and may be unwilling to invest in new software. If we are unable to further penetrate the existing market for business analytics software, the emerging market for self-service analytics solutions fails to grow or expand, or either of these markets decreases in size, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a wide range of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict.\nOur revenues and results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of various factors, some of which are outside of our control:\n\u2022\nthe timing of satisfying revenue recognition criteria, particularly with regard to large enterprise license agreements and other sales transactions, and as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard on January 1, 2018;\n\u2022\nthe transition from perpetual license transactions to term and subscription license transactions, which have lower unit sales prices than comparable perpetual licenses;\n\u2022\nthe expansion of our customer base;\n\u2022\nthe renewal of maintenance and subscription agreements with, and sales of additional products to, existing customers;\n\u2022\nseasonal variations in our sales, which have generally historically been highest in the fourth quarter of a calendar year and lowest in the first quarter;\n\u2022\nthe size, timing and terms of our perpetual license sales to both existing and new customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of term and subscription license sales versus perpetual license sales;\n\u2022\nthe mix of direct sales versus sales through our indirect sales channels;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of products and product enhancements, or the threat of such introduction, by existing competitors or new entrants into our market, and changes in pricing for products offered by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomers delaying purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors or otherwise;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers' budgets;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of and willingness to pay for new versions of our products;\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks or incidents; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions, both domestically and internationally, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers operate.\nAdditional factors include:\n\u2022\ncosts related to the hiring, training and retention of our direct sales force;\n\u2022\nthe timing and growth of our business, in particular through our hiring of new employees and international expansion;\n\u2022\nseasonal variations related to sales and marketing and other activities, such as expenses related to our annual customer conferences;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses; and\n\u2022\ntax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, tax rates or their interpretations and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities.\nAny one of these or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report may result in fluctuations in our revenues and operating results, meaning that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, results of operations and cash flows may not necessarily be indicative of our future performance.\nWe may not be able to accurately predict our future revenues or results of operations. For example, a large percentage of the revenues we recognize each quarter has been attributable to sales made in the last month of that same quarter. Our license revenues in particular can be impacted by short-term shifts in customer demand and spending as license revenues from perpetual and on-premises term license sales are generally recognized upfront. As a result, our ability to forecast revenues on a quarterly or longer-term basis is limited. In addition, we base our current and future expense levels on our operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating expenses are expected to be relatively fixed in the short term. Accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues, and even a small shortfall in revenues could disproportionately and adversely affect our financial results for that quarter. The variability and unpredictability of these and other factors could result in our failing to meet or exceed financial expectations for a given period.\nOur growth depends on being able to expand our direct sales force successfully.\nIn order to increase our revenues and profitability, we must increase the size of our direct sales force, both in the United States and internationally, to generate additional revenues from new and existing customers. We intend to further increase our number of direct sales professionals.\nWe believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. In addition,\nas we continue to grow, a large percentage of our sales force may be new to our company and our products, which may adversely affect our sales if we cannot train our sales force quickly or effectively. Attrition rates may increase, and we may face integration challenges as we continue to seek to expand our sales force. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe have been growing and expect to continue to invest in our growth for the foreseeable future. If we fail to manage this growth effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business. For example, we plan to continue to hire new employees, particularly in our sales and engineering groups including independent contributors, managers and group leaders. If we cannot adequately train these new employees, including our direct sales force, our sales productivity could be impacted, or our customers may lose confidence in the knowledge and capability of our employees. In addition, we are expanding internationally, establishing operations in additional countries outside the United States, and we intend to make substantial investments to continue our international expansion efforts. We must successfully manage our growth to achieve our objectives. Although our business has experienced significant growth in the past, we cannot provide any assurance that our business will continue to grow at any particular rate, or at all.\nOur ability to effectively manage the growth of our business will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to do the following:\n\u2022\neffectively recruit, integrate, train and motivate a large number of new employees, including our direct sales force, while retaining existing employees, maintaining the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture and effectively executing our business plan;\n\u2022\nsatisfy existing customers and attract new customers;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully innovate and introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls;\n\u2022\nprotect and further develop our strategic assets, including our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nmake sound business decisions in light of the scrutiny associated with operating as a public company.\nThese activities will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources, and our growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to execute on our business plan will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. There are no guarantees we will be able to do so in an efficient or timely manner, or at all. In particular, any failure to successfully implement new systems and/or enhancements and improvements to existing systems necessary to scale the business or adopt new accounting or other compliance requirements will likely negatively impact our ability to manage our expected growth (including the speed and efficiency of such growth), ensure uninterrupted operation of key business systems and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public reporting companies. Moreover, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of our software could suffer, which could negatively affect our brand, results of operations and overall business.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers and expand sales to existing customers, both domestically and internationally, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business may be harmed.\nOur future growth depends in part upon increasing our customer base. Our ability to achieve growth in revenues in the future will depend, in large part, upon the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally, and our ability to attract new customers. This may be particularly challenging where an organization has already invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional business intelligence products into its business, as such organization may be reluctant or unwilling to invest in a new product. If we fail to attract new customers and maintain and expand those customer relationships, our revenues could grow more slowly than expected, and our business could be harmed.\nOur future growth also depends upon expanding sales of our products to and renewing license and maintenance agreements with existing customers and their organizations. This includes customers of all sizes and scales. If our customers do not purchase additional licenses or capabilities, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected, may not grow at all or may decline. Additionally, increasing incremental sales to our current\ncustomer base requires increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. There can be no assurance that our efforts would result in expanding sales to existing customers and additional revenues. If our expansion sales efforts to our customers are not successful, our business would suffer. Our software is currently licensed and sold under perpetual, term and subscription license agreements, and we are currently transitioning to a more subscription-based business model. Due to the differences in unit sales prices of perpetual versus term or subscription license sales, shifts in the mix of term and subscription license sales could produce significant variations in the revenue we recognize in a given period. In addition, all of our maintenance services agreements are sold on a term basis. In order for us to grow our revenues and increase profitability, it is important that our existing customers renew their maintenance services agreements and their term licenses, if applicable, when the initial contract term expires. Our customers have no obligation to renew their term licenses or maintenance services contracts with us after the initial terms have expired. Our customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our software or professional services, our pricing or pricing structure, the pricing or capabilities of products or services offered by our competitors, the effects of economic conditions, or reductions in our customers' spending levels. If our customers do not renew their agreements with us, or renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenues may decline.\nOur international operations subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries, branches and representative offices and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Such corporate structures are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our positions were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, resulting in higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. Additionally, our future worldwide tax rate and financial position may be affected by changes in the relevant tax laws, interpretation of such tax laws or the influence of certain tax policy efforts of the European Union and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\").\nBreaches in our security, cyber-attacks or other cyber-risks could expose us to significant liabilities and cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nOur operations involve transmission and processing of our customers' confidential, proprietary and sensitive information including, in some cases, personally identifiable information and credit card information. We have legal and contractual obligations to protect the confidentiality and appropriate use of customer data. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to security risks, including but not limited to, unauthorized access to use or disclosure of customer data, theft of proprietary information, employee error or misconduct, denial of service attacks, loss or corruption of customer data, and computer hacking attacks or other cyber-attacks. Such events could expose us to substantial litigation expenses and damages, indemnity and other contractual obligations, government fines and penalties, mitigation expenses and other liabilities. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until successfully launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, our brand and reputation could be impacted, we could lose potential sales and existing customers, our ability to operate our business could be impaired, and we may incur significant liabilities. Moreover, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to data security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nOur failure to adequately protect personal or sensitive information or to comply with data protection laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA wide variety of local, state, national and international laws, directives and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal or sensitive data. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect such data, could result in enforcement actions against us, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by stockholders, end-customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of\ngoodwill (in relation to stockholders, existing end-customers and prospective end-customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business. Changing definitions of personal data, sensitive data and personal information, within the European Union, the United States and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of IP addresses, machine identification, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data.\nFor example, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), which takes effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also expands the definition of personal information used in most existing U.S. privacy laws. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability.\nIn the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") took effect on May 25, 2018, introducing new data protection requirements. The GDPR introduces strict requirements for processing personal data, including potentially burdensome documentation requirements, more stringent requirements for obtaining valid consent, obligations to honor expanded rights of individuals to control the use and retention of their personal data and requirements to notify regulators and affected individuals of certain personal data breaches. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process both on our own behalf and on behalf of our customers, increase our compliance costs and could restrict our operations in Europe.\nOur products use third-party software and services that may be difficult to replace or cause errors or failures of our products that could lead to a loss of customers or harm to our reputation and our operating results.\nWe license third-party software and depend on services from various third parties for use in our products. In the future, this software or these services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of the software or services could result in decreased functionality of our products until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available from another provider, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. In addition, any errors or defects in or failures of the third-party software or services could result in errors or defects in our products or cause our products to fail, which could harm our business and be costly to correct. Many of these providers attempt to impose limitations on their liability for such errors, defects or failures, and if enforceable, we may have additional liability to our customers or third-party providers that could harm our reputation and increase our operating costs.\nWe will need to maintain our relationships with third-party software and service providers and to obtain software and services from such providers that do not contain any errors or defects. Any failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to deliver effective products to our customers and could harm our operating results.\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that our corporate culture has been a critical component to our success. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. As we grow and mature as a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to recruit and retain personnel and effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our indirect sales channels.\nHistorically, we have used indirect sales channel partners, such as OEMs, technology partners, systems integrators and resellers. Indirect sales channel partners are becoming an increasingly important aspect of our business. Our future growth in revenues and profitability depends in part on our ability to identify, establish and retain successful channel partner relationships, which will take significant time and resources and involve significant risk.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to identify suitable indirect sales channel partners. To the extent we do identify such partners, we will need to negotiate the terms of a commercial agreement with them under which the partner would distribute our products. We cannot be certain that we will be able to negotiate commercially-attractive terms with any channel partner, if at all. In addition, all channel partners must be trained to distribute our products. In order to develop and expand our distribution channel, we must develop and improve our processes for channel partner introduction and training.\nWe also cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain successful relationships with any channel partners. These channel partners may not have an exclusive relationship with us and may offer customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with ours. With or without an exclusive relationship, we cannot be certain that they will prioritize or provide adequate resources for selling our products. A lack of support by any of our channel partners may harm our ability to develop, market, sell or support our products, as well as harm our brand. There can be no assurance that our channel partners will comply with the terms of our commercial agreements with them, including for example compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. export and trade controls, or will continue to work with us when our commercial agreements with them expire or are up for renewal. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these channel partners, or these channel partners fail to live up to their contractual obligations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur long-term growth depends in part on being able to expand internationally on a profitable basis.\nHistorically, we have generated a substantial majority of our revenues from customers inside the United States and Canada. For example, approximately 69% of our total ASC 606 revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were derived from sales within the United States and Canada. We plan to continue to expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy. Our international operations subject us to a variety of risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\nincreased personnel, travel, infrastructure, legal compliance and regulation costs associated with having multiple international operations;\n\u2022\nmanagement communication and integration problems resulting from geographic dispersion and language and cultural differences;\n\u2022\nsales and customer service challenges associated with operating in different countries;\n\u2022\nincreased reliance on indirect sales channel partners outside the United States;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or satisfying revenue recognition criteria, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic or political conditions in each country or region;\n\u2022\neconomic uncertainty around the world and adverse effects arising from economic interdependencies across countries and regions;\n\u2022\nuncertainty around how the United Kingdom's vote to exit the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" will impact the United Kingdom's access to the European Union Single Market, the related regulatory environment, the global economy and the resulting impact on our business;\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign laws and regulations and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws and regulations for foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our software in certain foreign markets and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022\nheightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of financial statements and irregularities in financial statements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and related effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in transferring or, if we determine to do so, repatriating funds from or converting currencies in certain countries;\n\u2022\nthe need for localized software and licensing programs;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain countries and practical difficulties and costs of enforcing rights abroad; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions and overlapping of different tax regimes.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our international operations, reduce our international revenues or increase our operating costs, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition and growth prospects.\nFor example, compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in government\nrequirements as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could have adverse effects on our business. In addition, in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us. As we grow, we continue to implement compliance procedures designed to prevent violations of these laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, indirect sales channel partners and agents will comply with the formal policies we will implement, or applicable laws and regulations. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties, or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our software and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. These internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to have our independent registered public accounting firm issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our brand recognition and reputation, and the failure to maintain or enhance our brand recognition or reputation would likely adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the Tableau brand identity and our reputation are critical to our relationships with our customers, including our user community, and channel partners and to our ability to attract new customers and channel partners. We also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation will continue to increase as competition in our market continues to develop. Our success in this area will depend on a wide range of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy of our marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to offer high-quality, innovative and error- and bug-free products;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain existing customers and obtain new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain high customer satisfaction;\n\u2022\nthe quality and perceived value of our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully differentiate our products from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nactions of our competitors and other third parties;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide customer support and professional services;\n\u2022\nany misuse or perceived misuse of our products;\n\u2022\npositive or negative publicity;\n\u2022\ninterruptions, delays or attacks on our website; and\n\u2022\nlitigation- or regulatory-related developments.\nOur brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenues.\nIndependent industry analysts often provide reviews of our products, as well as those of our competitors, and perception of our products in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. If these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors' products and services, our brand may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, negative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, our partners or others associated with any of these parties, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and\nhave an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful.\nEconomic uncertainties or downturns could materially adversely affect our business.\nCurrent or future economic uncertainties or downturns could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, the continued sovereign debt crisis, potential future government shutdowns, the U.S. government's failure to raise the debt ceiling, financial and credit market fluctuations (including changes in interest rates), the imposition of trade barriers and restrictions such as tariffs, political deadlock, natural catastrophes, warfare and terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia Pacific region or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments, including corporate spending on business analytics software in general and negatively affect the rate of growth of our business.\nThe inability of legislators to pass additional short- or longer-term spending bills could lead to additional shutdowns or other disruptions. In addition, general worldwide economic conditions could experience significant downturns and instability, including as a result of changes in global trade policies, such as Brexit developments in the United Kingdom, trade disputes and increased tariffs between the United States and China, or other political or economic developments. For example, Brexit has created substantial economic and political uncertainty, the impact of which depends on the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. This uncertainty may cause some of our customers or potential customers to curtail spending and may ultimately result in new regulatory and cost challenges to our United Kingdom and global operations. These conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately, and they could cause our customers to reevaluate their decisions to purchase our products, which could delay and lengthen our sales cycles or result in cancellations of planned purchases. Furthermore, during challenging economic times and/or during times of rising interest rates, our customers may tighten their budgets and face issues in gaining timely access to sufficient and/or affordable credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. In turn, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nTo the extent purchases of our software are perceived by customers and potential customers to be discretionary, our revenues may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. Also, customers may choose to develop in-house software as an alternative to using our products. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our software.\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or industries in which we operate do not improve, or worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop or license under patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States, so that we can prevent others from using our inventions and proprietary information. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be adversely affected. However, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expenses. Any of our patent rights, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others, weakened or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 40 issued U.S. patents covering our technology and 95 patent applications pending for examination in the United States. Internationally, we had two issued patents and 15 pending patent applications as of December 31, 2018 including filings at the European Patent Office and in Canada and Australia. The patents that we own or license from others (including those that have issued or may issue in the future) may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties, and our patent applications may never be granted.\nAdditionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.\nEven if issued, there can be no assurance that these patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are uncertain.\nAny patents that are issued may subsequently be invalidated or otherwise limited, allowing other companies to develop offerings that compete with ours, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. In addition, issuance of a patent does not guarantee that we have a right to practice the patented invention. Patent applications in the United States are typically not published until 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not at all, and publications of discoveries in industry-related literature lag behind actual discoveries. We cannot be certain that third parties do not have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing or practicing our patented software or technology.\nEffective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our software is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States (in particular, some foreign jurisdictions do not permit patent protection for software), and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the United States, including the recent America Invents Act, and other national governments and from interpretations of the intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nWe rely in part on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and other confidential information to maintain our competitive position. Although we endeavor to enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, licensees and others who may have access to this information, we cannot assure you that these agreements or other steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use, disclosure or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, third parties may independently develop technologies or products that compete with ours, and we may be unable to prevent this competition.\nWe spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert counterclaims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially viable. Any litigation, whether or not resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nCompanies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. The litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenues and against which our patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. We have received, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties' intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims, which is not uncommon with respect to the business analytics software market.\nThere may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued or pending patents that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming, could be expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management's attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. These claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party's rights. We might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license were available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating\nexpenses. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our software and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur use of open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell our software and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe use open source software in our software and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. We may face claims from others claiming ownership of, or seeking to enforce the license terms applicable to such open source software, including by demanding release of the open source software, derivative works or our proprietary source code that was developed using such software. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our software, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if the license terms for the open source code change, we may be forced to re-engineer our software or incur additional costs. Finally, we cannot assure you that we have not incorporated open source software into our software in a manner that may subject our proprietary software to an open source license that requires disclosure, to customers or the public, of the source code to such proprietary software. Any such disclosure would have a negative effect on our business and the value of our software.\nWe are and may be subject to disputes and litigation for a variety of claims, which could adversely affect our results of operations, harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nIn addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to other claims arising from our normal business activities. These include claims, lawsuits or proceedings involving labor and employment, wage and hour, commercial agreements, alleged securities laws violations or other investor claims and other matters. The outcome of any disputes or litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention and resources and lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims. Any adverse determination related to litigation could require us to change our technology or our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows, harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nOur success depends in part on maintaining and increasing our sales to customers in the public sector.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with federal, state, local and foreign governments and agencies, and we believe that the success and growth of our business will continue to depend on our successful procurement of government contracts. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. Factors that could impede our ability to maintain or increase the amount of revenues derived from government contracts include:\n\u2022\nchanges in fiscal or contracting policies;\n\u2022\ndecreases in available government funding;\n\u2022\nchanges in government programs or applicable requirements;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations;\n\u2022\npotential delays or changes in the government appropriations or other funding authorization processes;\n\u2022\ngovernments and governmental agencies requiring contractual terms that are unfavorable to us, such as most-favored-nation pricing provisions; and\n\u2022\ndelays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our software in the future or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFurther, to increase our sales to customers in the public sector, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, performance and pricing of contracts with the public sector, including U.S. federal, state and local governmental bodies, which affect how we and our channel partners do business in connection with governmental agencies. These laws and regulations may impose added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations or other applicable requirements, including non-compliance in the past, could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners or government customers, penalties,\ntermination of contracts, loss of intellectual property rights and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting. Any such damages, penalties, disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with the public sector could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAcquisitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may make acquisitions that could be material to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Acquisitions involve many risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nan acquisition may negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, including potential write- downs of deferred revenues, may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel or operations of any company that we acquire, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses and distract our management;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company we acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter difficulties in, or may be unable to, successfully sell any acquired products;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience or where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nchallenges inherent in effectively managing an increased number of employees in diverse locations;\n\u2022\nthe potential strain on our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\npotential known and unknown liabilities or deficiencies associated with an acquired company that were not identified in advance;\n\u2022\nour use of cash to pay for acquisitions would limit other potential uses for our cash and affect our liquidity;\n\u2022\nif we incur debt to fund such acquisitions, such debt may subject us to material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business as well as financial maintenance covenants;\n\u2022\nthe risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets or goodwill in future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nto the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity or convertible debt securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease; and\n\u2022\nmanaging the varying intellectual property protection strategies and other activities of an acquired company.\nWe may not succeed in addressing these or other risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the integration of any acquired business. The inability to integrate successfully the business, technologies, products, personnel or operations of any acquired business, or any significant delay in achieving integration, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nGovernmental export or import controls could limit our ability to compete in foreign markets and subject us to liability if we violate them.\nOur products are subject to U.S. export controls, and we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products. These products and the underlying technology may be exported only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. U.S. export controls may require submission of an encryption registration, product classification and annual or semi-annual reports. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required import or export authorization for our products, when\napplicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenues. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products, including with respect to new releases of our software, may create delays in the introduction of our product releases in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products to some countries altogether. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. If we fail to comply with export and import regulations and such economic sanctions, we may be fined or other penalties could be imposed, including a denial of certain export privileges. Moreover, any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nSignificant judgments and estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Our tax expense may be impacted if our intercompany transactions, which are required to be computed on an arm's-length basis, are challenged and successfully disputed by the taxing authorities. Also, our tax expense could be impacted depending on the applicability of withholding taxes and other indirect taxes on software licenses and related intercompany transactions in certain jurisdictions. In determining the adequacy of income taxes, we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes that could result if our tax positions were challenged by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and other taxing authorities. The taxing authorities in the United States and other countries where we do business regularly examine our income and other tax returns. The ultimate outcome of any tax examination cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the IRS or other taxing authorities assess additional taxes as a result of an examination, we may be required to record charges to our operations.\nOur tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period. In periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate. In future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\nNatural or man-made disasters and other similar events may significantly disrupt our business and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny of our facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, floods, nuclear disasters, acts of terrorism or other criminal activities, infectious disease outbreaks and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to operate our business for some period of time. Our facilities would likely be costly to repair or replace, and any such efforts would likely require substantial time. Any disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business and results of operations and harm our reputation. In addition, we may not carry sufficient business insurance to compensate for losses that may occur. Any such losses or damages could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the facilities of significant customers or major strategic partners may be harmed or rendered inoperable by such natural or man-made disasters, which may cause disruptions, difficulties or material adverse effects on our business.\nChanges in financial accounting standards may cause adverse and unexpected impacts to our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). These accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") and the SEC. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future. A\nchange in accounting standards or practices could harm our operating results, reduce the comparability of our historical results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. Examples of new accounting pronouncements include the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, and the new lease accounting standard, ASC 842. We adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. As further discussed in Note 2 of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements, this standard significantly impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to prior years as it changed the way we recognize revenue and the timing of revenue recognition related to our on-premises term license agreements. Additionally, we will adopt ASC 842 using the modified retrospective transition method and apply a cumulative-effect balance sheet adjustment at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019. We expect the adoption of the new lease accounting standard will have a material impact to our consolidated balance sheet on the date of adoption, resulting in the recognition of significant right of use assets and operating lease liabilities. These or other changes to existing rules may harm our operating results and affect the comparability of our operating results and financial condition from period to period.\nIf currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, the results of our operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected.\nThe majority of our sales contracts have historically been denominated in U.S. dollars. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our software to our customers outside of the United States, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As we continue to expand our international operations, we could have more sales contracts denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which would increase our exposure to the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, we incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of such expenses being higher. This could have a negative impact on our reported results of operations. Developments such as changes in U.S. trade policies and the outcome of the Brexit referendum have caused, and continue to cause, significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. We currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks by engaging in foreign exchange hedging transactions, although we may do so in the future.\nWe are exposed to collection and credit risks, which could impact our operating results.\nOur accounts receivable and contract assets are subject to collection and credit risks. These assets may include upfront purchase commitments for multiple years of subscription-based software licenses and maintenance services, which may be invoiced over multiple reporting periods increasing these risks. For example, our operating results may be impacted by significant bankruptcies among customers, which could negatively impact our revenues and cash flows. Although we have processes in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate these risks, we cannot guarantee these programs will be effective. If we are unable to adequately control these risks, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business or impact our investment portfolio.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may require additional capital to fund our business and support our growth, and our inability to generate and obtain such capital on acceptable terms, or at all, could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe intend to continue to make substantial investments to fund our business and support our growth. In addition, we may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or enhance our software, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire or develop complementary businesses and technologies. As a result, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to provide the funds required for these and other business endeavors. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common\nstock. Any debt financing that we may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain such additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected. In addition, our inability to generate or obtain the financial resources needed may require us to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our operations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in the potential for substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe trading price for shares of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile for the foreseeable future. For example, our Class A common stock's daily closing price on the New York Stock Exchange ranged from $77.82 to $132.96 during the 12-month period ended February 19, 2019. On February 19, 2019, the closing price of our Class A common stock was $126.97.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors listed below and other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors on a quarterly basis;\n\u2022\nratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad;\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks or incidents; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. Involvement in securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and could\nimpair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had options outstanding that, if fully exercised, would result in the issuance of approximately 0.1 million and 1.8 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock, respectively. Our Class B common stock converts into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. All of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of options (or upon conversion of shares of Class B common stock issued upon the exercise of options) have been registered for public resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future. Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts or their expectations regarding our performance on a quarterly or annual basis. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If we fail to meet one or more of these analysts' published expectations regarding our performance on a quarterly basis, our share price or trading volume could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and the existing ownership of capital stock by our founders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our founders for the foreseeable future, which will limit the ability of our other investors to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2018, the holders of shares of Class B common stock collectively beneficially owned shares representing approximately 60% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our founders collectively beneficially owned shares representing a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of that date. Consequently, the holders of Class B common stock, including our founders, collectively control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. This concentrated control limits the ability of our other investors to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. For example, these stockholders control elections of directors, amendments of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, increases to the number of shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans or adoption of new equity incentive plans, and approval of any merger or sale of assets for the foreseeable future. This control may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long-term, which may include our founders.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management's attention and affect our ability to attract and retain additional executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time as regulatory and governing bodies issue revisions to, or new interpretations of, these public company requirements. Such changes could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher legal and financial costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We will continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and\nstandards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nBeing a public company under these rules and regulations has made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and in the future we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers or members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees.\nAs a result of the disclosures within our filings with the SEC, information about our business and our financial condition is available to competitors and other third parties, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nOur share repurchase program may not achieve its objective to enhance long-term stockholder value and could increase the volatility of our stock price.\nOn November 1, 2016, we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding Class A common stock. On April 26, 2018, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $300 million of our outstanding Class A common stock under our previously announced stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2018, we had repurchased and retired 2,931,541 shares of our Class A common stock for a total of $220.0 million and were authorized to repurchase up to a remaining $280.0 million of our Class A common stock under the existing stock repurchase program. We cannot guarantee that our repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value. For example, the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchase our stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. Our repurchases of common stock could also affect the market price of our common stock or increase its volatility. For example, the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, the program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time, and any of which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed for cause;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any holder of at least 15% of our capital stock for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder.", "PERMNO": 13914, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "DATA"}
