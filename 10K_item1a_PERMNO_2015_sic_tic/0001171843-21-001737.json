{"cik": "1123494", "company": "HARVARD BIOSCIENCE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following factors should be reviewed carefully, in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our business faces a variety of risks. These risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business operations, performance and financial condition could be adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe life sciences industry is very competitive.\nWe expect to encounter increased competition from both established and development-stage companies that continually enter the market. These include companies developing and marketing life science instruments, systems and lab consumables, health care companies that manufacture laboratory-based tests and analyzers, diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, analytical instrument companies, and companies developing life science or drug discovery technologies. Currently, our principal competition comes from established companies that provide products that perform many of the same functions for which we market our products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, operational, marketing and technical resources than we do. Moreover, these competitors may offer broader product lines and tactical discounts and may have greater name recognition. In addition, we may face competition from new entrants into the field. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing, distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future. In addition, we face changing customer preferences and requirements, including increased customer demand for more environmentally friendly products.\nThe life sciences industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. In some instances, our competitors may develop or market products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future products. To meet the evolving needs of customers, we must continually enhance our current and planned products and develop and introduce new products. However, we may experience difficulties that may delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements. In addition, our product lines are based on complex technologies that are subject to change as new technologies are developed and introduced in the marketplace. We may have difficulty in keeping abreast of the changes affecting each of the different markets we serve or intend to serve. Our failure to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing technology, market demands, or the requirements of our customers could cause our product sales to decline, and we could experience significant losses.\nWe offer, and plan to continue to offer, a broad range of products and have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial expenses for development of new products and enhancements to our existing products. The speed of technological change in our market may prevent us from being able to successfully market some or all of our products for the length of time required to recover development costs. Failure to recover the development costs of one or more products or product lines could decrease our profitability or cause us to experience significant losses.\nA portion of our revenues are derived from customers from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and are subject to risks faced by those industries. Such risks may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We expect that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies will continue to be a significant source of our revenues for the foreseeable future, including in our Cellular and Molecular Technologies and Preclinical product families. As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that affect the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, such as government regulation, ongoing consolidation, uncertainty of technological change, and reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries.\nIn particular, the biotechnology industry is largely dependent on raising capital to fund its operations. If biotechnology companies that are our customers are unable to obtain the financing necessary to purchase our products, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we are dependent, both directly and indirectly, upon general health care spending patterns, particularly in the research and development budgets of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as upon the financial condition and purchasing patterns of various governments and government agencies. As it relates to both the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, many companies have significant patents that have expired or are about to expire, which could result in reduced revenues for those companies. If pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies that are our customers suffer reduced revenues as a result of these patent expirations, they may be unable to purchase our products, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products, adversely impact our revenues, or increase our expenses.\nWe operate in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by, and in compliance with, those regulations. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and post marketing reporting. We must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of our products, and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to our business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of our products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while we or our suppliers remedy the alleged violation; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nReductions in customers\u2019 research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers are universities, government research laboratories, private foundations and other institutions who are dependent on grants from U.S. government agencies, such as NIH, for funding. These customers represent a significant source of our revenue. Research and development spending by our customers may fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. The level of government funding for research and development is unpredictable. In the past, NIH grants have been frozen or otherwise made unavailable for extended periods or directed to certain products. Reductions or delay in governmental spending could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products. If government funding necessary for purchase of our products were to decrease, our business and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending.\nOur business is subject to economic, political and other risks associated with international revenues and operations.\nWe manufacture and sell our products worldwide and as a result, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. A substantial amount of our revenues is derived from international operations, and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the United States in the future. We anticipate that revenues from international operations will likely continue to increase as a result of our efforts to expand our business in markets abroad. In addition, a number of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the United States. Our foreign operations subject us to certain risks, including: effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the impact of local economic conditions; local product preferences and seasonality and product requirements; local difficulty to effectively establish and expand our business and operations in international markets; disruptions of capital and trading markets; restrictions and potentially negative tax implications of transfer of capital across borders; differing labor regulations; other factors beyond our control, including potential political instability, terrorism, acts of war, natural disasters and diseases, including the coronavirus discussed below; unexpected changes and increased enforcement of regulatory requirements and various state, federal and international, intellectual property, environmental, antitrust, anti-corruption, fraud and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws) and employment laws; interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; and laws and regulations on foreign investment in the United States under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, and other agencies, including the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, or FIRRMA, adopted in August 2018.\nWe may incur a variety of costs in connection with acquisitions we may seek to consummate in the future, and we may never realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions due in part to difficulties integrating the businesses, operations and product lines.\nOur business strategy has historically included the acquisition of businesses, technologies, services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business. If we were to undertake future acquisitions, the process of integrating the acquired business, technology, service and/or product(s) may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and potentially absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. Moreover, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition as rapidly as expected, or at all. Such transactions are inherently risky, and any such recent or future acquisitions could reduce stockholders\u2019 ownership, cause us to incur debt, expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definite lives, which may adversely impact our ability to undertake future acquisitions on substantially similar terms. We may also incur significant expenditures in anticipation of an acquisition that is never realized.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on the integration and leveraging of technology, operations, sales and marketing channels and personnel. Integration is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner. We may have difficulty successfully integrating acquired businesses, and their domestic and foreign operations or product lines, and as a result, we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions we make. We cannot assure that our growth rate will equal the growth rates that have been experienced by us, and these other acquired companies, respectively, operating as separate companies in the past.\nWe have substantial debt and other financial obligations, and we may incur even more debt. Any failure to meet our debt and other financial obligations or maintain compliance with related covenants could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2020, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with certain financial institutions party thereto as lenders (the \u201cLenders\u201d), Citizens Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, and Citizens Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Silicon Valley Bank, as joint bookrunners, joint lead arrangers and syndication agents. The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan of $40.0 million and a $25.0 million senior revolving credit facility (collectively, the \u201cCitizens Credit Facility\u201d). The Citizens Credit Facility replaces our prior credit facility with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, as agent and lender (the \u201cPrior Credit Facility\u201d), and in connection with the entry into the Credit Agreement, we paid off all outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding borrowings of $49.4 million under the Credit Agreement. The Citizens Credit Facility will mature on December 22, 2025.\nPursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we are subject to various covenants, including negative covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions, which may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. Such negative covenants include, among other things, limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u25cf\nincur debt,\n\u25cf\nincur liens,\n\u25cf\nmake investments (including acquisitions),\n\u25cf\nsell assets, and\n\u25cf\npay dividends on our capital stock.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, each of which will be tested at the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company.\nIf we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants, in addition to other actions the Lenders may require, the amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. This immediate payment may negatively impact our financial condition. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient to pay interest and principal on our debt in the future. If that should occur, our capital raising or debt restructuring measures may be unsuccessful or inadequate to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations and further impair our liquidity.\nFurther, based upon our actual performance levels, our covenants relating to leverage and fixed charges could limit our ability to incur additional debt, which could hinder our ability to execute our current business strategy.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations and comply with financial covenants depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance will continue to be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Failure within any applicable grace or cure periods to may such payments, comply with the financial covenants, or any other non-financial or restrictive covenant, would create a default under our Credit Agreement. Our cash flow and existing capital resources may be insufficient to repay our debt at maturity, in which such case prior thereto we would have to extend such maturity date, or otherwise repay, refinance and or restructure the obligations under the Credit Agreement, including with proceeds from the sale of assets, and additional equity or debt capital. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining such extension, or entering into such repayment, refinance or restructure prior to maturity, or any other default existed under the Credit Agreement, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies, which would jeopardize our ability to continue our current operations.\nEthical concerns surrounding the use of our products and misunderstanding of the nature of our business could adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our existing products and new products.\nSome of our products may be used in areas of research involving animal research and other techniques presently being explored in the life science industry. These techniques have drawn negative attention in the public forum. Government authorities may regulate or prohibit any of these activities. Additionally, the public may disfavor or reject these activities.\nIf we are not able to manage our growth, our operating profits may be adversely impacted.\nOur success will depend on the expansion of our operations through organic growth, and we may execute acquisitions in the future to augment this growth. Effective growth management will place increased demands on our management team, operational and financial resources and expertise. To manage growth, we must optimize our operational, financial and management processes and systems, and hire and train additional qualified personnel. Failure to manage this growth effectively could impair our ability to generate revenues or could cause our expenses to increase more rapidly than revenues, resulting in operating losses or reduced profitability.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a negative impact on our reported earnings.\nWe are subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, which could have an adverse effect on the sales price of our products in foreign markets, as well as the costs and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries. A substantial amount of our revenues is derived from international operations, and we anticipate that a significant portion of revenues will continue to come from outside the United States in the future. As a result, currency fluctuations among the United States dollar, British pound, euro and the other currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses. We have not used forward exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposures. We attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities. In the future, we may undertake to manage foreign currency risk through hedging methods, including foreign currency contracts. We recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in managing foreign currency risk or in predicting the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks.\nFailure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure or software could adversely affect our day-to-day operations and decision-making processes and have an adverse effect on our performance.\nWe depend on accurate and timely information and numerical data from key software applications to aid our day-to-day business, financial reporting and decision-making and, in many cases, proprietary and custom-designed software is necessary to operate our business. We are upgrading our disaster recovery procedures for our critical systems. However, any disruption caused by the failure of these systems, the underlying equipment, or communication networks could delay or otherwise adversely impact our day-to-day business and decision making, could make it impossible for us to operate critical equipment, and could have an adverse effect on our performance, if our disaster recovery plans do not mitigate the disruption. Disruptions could be caused by a variety of factors, such as catastrophic events or weather, power outages, or cyber-attacks on our systems by outside parties.\nWe review our IT systems regularly to assess and implement opportunities to improve or upgrade our enterprise resource planning (ERP) or other information systems required to operate our business effectively. Our ERP systems are critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records, record transactions, provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements. The implementation of any IT systems, including ERP systems has required in the past, and may continue to require, the investment of significant financial and human resources. In addition, we may not be able to successfully complete the implementation of the ERP systems without experiencing difficulties. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of any IT system, including ERP systems could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to our business or reputation\nTo meet business objectives, we rely on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these IT systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our sensitive data. We continually assess these threats and make investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure our third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To date, we have not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for us to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020, provides private rights of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Compliance with the CCPA and other current and future applicable privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and time-consuming. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.\nWe may incur additional restructuring costs or not realize the expected benefits of our initiatives to reduce operating expenses to date and in the future.\nWe may not be able to implement all of the actions that we intend to take in the restructuring of our operations, and we may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits from such realignment and restructuring plans or other similar restructurings in the future. In addition, we may incur additional restructuring costs in implementing such realignment and restructuring plans or other similar future plans in excess of our expectations. The implementation of our restructuring efforts, including the reduction of our workforce, may not improve our operational and cost structure or result in greater efficiency of our organization; and we may not be able to support sustainable revenue growth and profitability following such restructurings.\nFailure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to implement our acquisition strategy, expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in less revenues.\nWe anticipate that our financial resources, which include available cash, cash generated from operations, and debt and equity capacity, will be sufficient to finance operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. However, this expectation is premised on the current operating plan, which may change as a result of many factors, including market acceptance of new products and future opportunities with collaborators. Consequently, we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated. In addition, our borrowings under the Citizens Credit Facility may not be sufficient to fund our acquisition strategy. In such case, our inability to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and in a timely manner (if at all) could seriously harm our business, product development, and acquisition efforts. In addition, our Credit Agreement contains various negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and make acquisitions for aggregate consideration in excess of $5.0 million. If future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may have to alter our operations or change our business strategy. We cannot assure you that the capital required to fund operations, or our acquisition strategy will be available in the future.\nIf we fail to retain key personnel and hire, train and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could result in reduced revenue or increased costs.\nOur success is highly dependent on the continued services of key management, technical and scientific personnel. Our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time upon short notice. The loss of the services of any member of the senior management team, including the Chief Executive Officer, James Green; the Chief Financial Officer, Michael Rossi; or any of the managerial, technical or scientific staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development, our growth strategies and other business objectives. Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, recruit and retain additional qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. We operate in several geographic locations where labor markets are particularly competitive, including the Boston, Massachusetts and Minneapolis, Minnesota metropolitan areas, England, and Germany where demand for personnel with these skills is extremely high and is likely to remain high. As a result, competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly in the areas of general management, finance, information technology, engineering and science, and the process of hiring suitably qualified personnel is often lengthy and expensive, and may become more expensive in the future. If we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced.\nOur success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others, including the patent rights, trademarks and trade names of third parties. Intellectual property litigation is costly, and the outcome is uncertain. If we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation, in addition to any damages we might have to pay, we could be required to stop the infringing activity, or obtain a license to or design around the intellectual property in question. If we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms, or are unable to design around any third-party patent, we may be unable to sell some of our products and services, which could result in reduced revenue.\nAs a result of our spin-off of Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology, Inc., now known as Biostage, together with certain related transactions, third parties may seek to hold us responsible for Biostage\u2019s liabilities, including liabilities that Biostage has assumed from us.\nThird parties may continue to seek to hold us responsible for Biostage\u2019s liabilities, including any of the liabilities that Biostage agreed to retain or assume in connection with the separation of the Biostage business from our businesses, and related spin-off distribution. On April 14, 2017, anticipated representatives for the estate of an individual plaintiff filed a wrongful death complaint with the Suffolk Superior Court, in the County of Suffolk, Massachusetts, against us and other defendants, including Biostage, as well as another third party. The complaint seeks payment for an unspecified amount of damages and alleges that the plaintiff sustained terminal injuries allegedly caused by products, including one synthetic trachea scaffold and two bioreactors, provided by certain of the named defendants and utilized in connection with surgeries performed by third parties in Europe in 2012 and 2013. We continue to vigorously defend this case by counsel provided by our liability insurance carrier from whom we have requested defense and indemnification for losses incurred related to this lawsuit. Any such product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to satisfy all liabilities resulting from this claim. If claims against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted. While we believe that claims made in this lawsuit are without merit, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation. Pursuant to our agreements with Biostage, Biostage has agreed to indemnify us for claims and losses relating to certain liabilities that it has assumed from us, including liabilities in connection with the sale of Biostage\u2019s products, intellectually property infringement and other liabilities related to the operation of Biostage\u2019s business. However, if those liabilities are significant and we are ultimately held liable for them, we cannot assure you that Biostage will have the ability to satisfy its obligations to us, in particular due to Biostage having limited revenues, products in early-stage development and a need for additional funds in the future. If Biostage is unable to satisfy its obligations under its indemnity to us, we may have to satisfy these obligations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity-linked securities, existing percentages of ownership in our common stock will be reduced and these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock.\nWe may raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity-linked securities to repay our existing indebtedness, implement our acquisition strategy, expand our operations and/or invest in new products. If we so raise additional funds through such sales, existing percentages of ownership in our common stock will be reduced and these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock. We may issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements, we may relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products, or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and could experience substantial declines in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may become volatile and could decline in the future, perhaps substantially, in response to various factors including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nsignificant sales of our common stock, whether by us or our shareholders;\n\u00b7\nvolatility of the financial markets;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies;\n\u00b7\ntechnological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies;\n\u00b7\nrevenues and operating results fluctuating or failing to meet the expectations of management, securities analysts, or investors in any quarter;\n\u00b7\ncomments of securities analysts and mistakes by or misinterpretation of comments from analysts, downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or management guidance;\n\u00b7\ninvestment banks and securities analysts becoming subject to lawsuits that may adversely affect the perception of the market;\n\u00b7\nconditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of significant acquisitions or financings or strategic partnerships;\n\u00b7\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits of the DSI acquisition;\n\u00b7\nnon-compliance with the internal control standards pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and\n\u00b7\na decrease in the demand for our common stock.\nIn addition, public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volatility. The stock market and the Nasdaq Global Market in general, and the biotechnology industry and small cap markets in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that at times may have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may further harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nGeneral Risks\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has significantly impact worldwide economic conditions and has negatively impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing global outbreak of COVID-19 has caused disruptions to our business and has had a negative impact on our operations to date. As a result of the outbreak, many of our customers, particularly academic research institutions, have had laboratory work negatively impacted, which will continue to negatively impact, our sales. Additionally, to ensure business continuity while maintaining a safe environment for employees, the majority of our workforce continues to work from home. We continue to require social distancing and other measures in factories for our manufacturing and other personnel essential to production to continue work within our facilities. Business travel continues to be significantly reduced. While we have maintained operations under these conditions, these measures represent disruptions which can impact productivity including sales and marketing activities. Accordingly, these conditions in addition to the overall impact on the global economy could continue to have a negative impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cUK\u201d) exit from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) could adversely affect our business.\nThe UK House of Commons passed a Brexit deal on December 20, 2019 and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. On December 30, 2020, the EU and UK entered into the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The announcement of Brexit has resulted in significant volatility in global stock market and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU may also create global economic uncertainty, including an uncertain funding environment for UK customers historically receiving funding from the EU, which may cause our customers to reduce their spending budgets. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the UK is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially change the regulatory regime applicable to the approval of any product candidates in the UK. Brexit is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIf we incur higher costs as a result of trade policies, treaties, government regulations or tariffs, we may become less profitable.\nThere continues to be uncertainty about the relationship between the United States and foreign countries, including with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. We are unable to predict whether or when tariffs will be imposed or the impact of any such future tariff increases.\nWe may be the subject of lawsuits from counterparties to acquisitions and divestitures, including an acquiring company or its stockholders, an acquired company\u2019s previous stockholders, a divested company\u2019s stockholders or our current stockholders.\nWe may be the subject of lawsuits from either an acquiring company or its stockholders, an acquired company\u2019s previous stockholders, a divested company\u2019s stockholders or our current stockholders. Such lawsuits could result from the actions of the acquisition or divestiture target prior to the date of the acquisition or divestiture, from the acquisition or divestiture transaction itself or from actions after the acquisition or divestiture. Defending potential lawsuits could cost us significant expense and detract management\u2019s attention from the operation of the business. Additionally, these lawsuits could result in the cancellation of or the inability to renew certain insurance coverage that would be necessary to protect our assets.\nRising commodity and precious metals costs could adversely impact our profitability.\nRaw material commodities such as resins, and precious metal commodities such as platinum are subject to wide price variations. Increases in the costs of these commodities and the costs of energy, transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution.\nProvisions of Delaware law, or of our charter and bylaws may make a takeover more difficult, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in the Delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt, which is opposed by management and the board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so. We have a staggered board of directors that makes it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to change our management and board of directors. Such provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future.", "PERMNO": 88839, "SIC": 3826, "TIC": "HBIO"}
