RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we express in forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report or in other Company communications. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on the travel industry generally and, as a result, on our business and results of operations, and these impacts may persist for an extended period of time or become more pronounced over time.\nThe global spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is complex, unpredictable, and continuously evolving and has resulted in significant disruption and additional risks to our business; the travel and hospitality industries; and the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has led governments and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on large gatherings of people, travel bans, border closings and restrictions, business closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing and masking measures and vaccination mandates. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic, including existing and new variants, and its consequences have significantly reduced global passenger air travel and have had a material detrimental impact on global commercial activity across the travel and hospitality industries, all of which has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, operations, and financial results.\nThe extent, duration, and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic's effects will depend on various factors, all of which are highly uncertain, difficult to predict and not controlled by us, including, but not limited to, the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity, as well as actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic, including vaccination rates in the markets where we operate, and any additional resurgence of COVID-19 and the development of new variants. These factors include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and our industry, including mandates that require all passengers and our crewmembers to be vaccinated; the demand for air travel; levels of consumer confidence; COVID-19-based health and safety protocols; the ability to effectively and widely manufacture and distribute vaccines and broad acceptance of the vaccine by the general population; and the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides. Moreover, even after shelter-in-place orders and travel bans and advisories are lifted, and vaccines are more widely distributed and available and vaccination rates increase, demand for air travel may remain depressed for a significant length of time, and we cannot predict if and when demand will return to pre-COVID-19 levels. In addition, we cannot predict whether business travel for in-person meetings will decrease over the long-term due to technological advancements in, and consumer acceptance and adaptation to, virtual meetings and/or changes in customer preferences.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations, and financial condition to a number of significant risks:\nDemand, Capacity, Revenues and Expenses: With the global spread of COVID-19 beginning in March 2020, the Company began experiencing a significant decline in international and domestic demand related to COVID-19 during the first quarter of 2020, and this reduction in demand has continued through the date of this report and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. The decline in demand caused a material deterioration in our revenues, resulting in a net loss of $182 million and $1.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would mandate all passengers on our domestic flights to be vaccinated, which could negatively impact demand in certain of our markets. The continued decline in demand, which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, is expected to have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused us, and could continue to cause us, to incur additional expenses. While governments have and may continue to implement various stimulus and relief programs, it is uncertain whether and to what extent we will be eligible to participate in, or successfully access, such programs, whether conditions or restrictions imposed under such\nprograms will be acceptable, and whether such programs will be effective in avoiding or mitigating the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we have incurred additional costs related to severance payments and may incur additional expenses related to restructuring activities in future periods. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and the associated restrictions begin to ease, we could experience other short or longer-term impacts on our costs, including, for example, the need for enhanced health and hygiene standards or certifications, social distancing requirements or other precautionary measures in response to the health and safety challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects could impact our ability to generate profits even after revenues improve. The Company has and expects to continue to focus on reducing expenses and managing liquidity.\nOperations: In response to the significant decline in demand for air travel across our system, we have taken actions and continue to evaluate spending to manage operating expenses and optimize our financial resources. These actions include a temporary reduction in our workforce across our BlueCities and our support centers in 2020, eliminating non-essential spending and corporate initiatives, and reducing costs. We have received, and may continue to receive, demands or requests from labor unions that represent our colleagues, whether in the course of our periodic renegotiation of our collective bargaining agreements or otherwise, for additional compensation, healthcare benefits, or other terms that could increase costs, and we could experience labor disputes or disruptions as we continue to implement our mitigation plans. Additionally, as a result of a federal government mandate and by virtue of JetBlue being a contractor to the federal government, our crewmembers who do not receive an approved medical or religious accommodation may be required to be vaccinated. As a result, we may face staffing shortages as we begin to enforce this mandate that may disrupt our operations. Further, once the effects of the pandemic subside, the recovery period could be extended and we expect that certain operational changes, particularly with respect to enhanced health and safety measures and global care and cleanliness certifications, will be necessary over the long-term.\nFurther, certain crewmembers of the Company, its suppliers and its business partners, such as airport, air traffic personnel, and those working on certain production lines, have tested positive for or been suspected of having COVID-19, which has resulted in facility closures, reduction in available staffing, and disruptions to the Company\u2019s overall operations as well as that of our suppliers. The Company\u2019s operations may be further impacted in the event of additional instances of actual or perceived risk of infection among crewmembers of the Company, its suppliers or its business partners, and this impact may have a material and adverse effect if the Company is unable to maintain a suitably skilled and sized workforce and address related crewmember matters.\nFinancial Condition and Indebtedness: As we manage through the effects of the pandemic, our level of indebtedness has increased and may continue to increase. To enhance our liquidity profile and cash position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company suspended share repurchases under its share repurchase program, executed two new term loan agreements and immediately drew down on these facilities for the full amount available, borrowed on its existing $550 million revolving credit facility, completed the public placements of equipment notes in an aggregate principal amount of $923 million, completed a public offering of 42 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of $583 million, completed a private offering for $750 million of 0.50% convertible notes, executed a number of aircraft sale-leaseback transactions, and temporarily grounded a portion of its fleet. There is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. We also expect the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets could also adversely affect our ability to raise equity financing in the future. Changes in the credit ratings of our debt, including our revolving credit facility and outstanding senior notes, could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. As a result of the general economic uncertainty and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our credit ratings have been downgraded. If our credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our credit rating levels, our industry, or our Company, our access to capital and the cost of debt financing would be negatively impacted.\nThe Company may also take additional actions to improve its financial position, including measures to improve liquidity, such as the issuance of additional unsecured and secured debt securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities, the sale of assets and/or the entry into additional bilateral and syndicated secured and/or unsecured credit facilities. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such issuance, which may be in the near term, or that any such additional financing will be completed on favorable terms, or at all. Any such actions may be material in nature and could result in significant additional borrowing. The Company's reduction in expenditures, measures to improve liquidity or other strategic actions that the Company may take in the future in response to COVID-19 may not be effective in offsetting decreased demand, and the Company will not be permitted to take certain strategic actions as a result of restrictions under the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, and the American Rescue Plan Act, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nGrowth: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted, and could continue to impact, the pace and timing of our growth. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company reduced its planned capital expenditures and operating expenditures in 2020 (including by postponing projects deemed non-critical to the Company's operations), suspended share repurchases under its share repurchase program, and grounded or redeployed aircraft.\nSecurities Markets Volatility: The global stock markets have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the price of our common stock has been volatile since the onset of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the significant uncertainties it has caused for the global economy and travel industry in particular, business activity, and business confidence have had, and are likely to continue to have, a significant effect on the market price of securities generally, including our securities. In addition, certain government restrictions limit our ability to engage in share repurchase activity.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition are continuously evolving, and the continuation of the pandemic, any additional resurgence, of COVID-19 or variants could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors included in this annual report, which in turn could further materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and profitability, including in ways that are not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks.\nCOVID-19 has materially disrupted our strategic operating plans in the near-term, and there are risks to our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition associated with executing our strategic operating plans in the long-term.\nCOVID-19 has materially disrupted our strategic operating plans, and there are risks to our business, operating results and financial condition associated with executing our long-term strategic operating plans. In recent years, we have announced several strategic operating plans, including several revenue-generating initiatives and plans to optimize revenue, such as our plans to add capacity, including international expansion and new or increased service to mid-size airports, initiatives and plans to optimize and control our costs and opportunities to enhance our segmentation and improve the customer experience at all points in air travel. In July 2020, we announced a strategic partnership with American Airlines Group Inc. (\u201cAAL\u201d), designed to optimize the Company and AAL\u2019s network through certain flights operated by us and AAL to and from John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport and Boston Logan International Airport. In developing our strategic operating plans, we make certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand, competition, market consolidation, the availability of aircraft and the global economy. Actual economic, market and other conditions have been and may continue to be different from our assumptions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially disrupted the execution of our strategic operating plans, including plans to add capacity in 2020 and 2021. If we do not successfully execute or adjust our strategic operating plans in the long-term, or if actual results continue to vary significantly from our prior assumptions or vary significantly from our future assumptions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.\nRisks related to JetBlue\nWe operate in an extremely competitive industry.\nThe domestic airline industry is characterized by low profit margins, high fixed costs and significant price competition in an increasingly concentrated competitive field. We currently compete with other airlines on all of our routes. Most of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do. Following our entry into new markets or expansion of existing markets, some of our competitors have chosen to add service or engage in extensive price competition. Unanticipated shortfalls in expected revenues as a result of price competition or in the number of passengers carried would negatively impact our financial results and harm our business. The extremely competitive nature of the airline industry could prevent us from attaining the level of passenger traffic or maintaining the level of fares required to maintain profitable operations in new and existing markets and could impede our profitable growth strategy, which would harm our business.\nFurthermore, there have been numerous mergers and acquisitions within the airline industry over the years. The industry may continue to change. Any business combination could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the airline industry and could cause fares of our competitors to be reduced. For example, in February 2022, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines announced an intention to merge. If the proposed merger meets regulatory and stockholder approval, the combined airline is expected to be a larger competitor to JetBlue, which may affect our competitiveness. Additionally, if a traditional network airline were to fully develop a low cost structure, or if we were to experience increased competition from low cost carriers or new entrants, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to competitive risks due to the long-term nature of our fleet order book.\nAt present, we have existing aircraft commitments through 2027. As technological evolution occurs in our industry, through the use of composites and other innovations, we may be competitively disadvantaged because we have existing extensive fleet commitments that would prohibit us from adopting new technologies on an expedited basis.\nOperational Risks\nOur business is highly dependent on the availability of fuel and fuel is subject to price volatility.\nOur results of operations are heavily impacted by the price and availability of fuel. Fuel costs comprise a substantial portion of our total operating expenses. Historically, fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical factors as well as supply and demand. The availability of fuel is not only dependent on crude oil but also on refining capacity. When even a small amount of the domestic or global oil refining capacity becomes unavailable, supply shortages can result for extended periods of time. The availability of fuel is also affected by demand for home heating oil, gasoline and other petroleum products, as well as crude oil reserves, dependence on foreign imports of crude oil and potential hostilities in oil producing areas of the world. Because of the effects of these factors on the price and availability of fuel, the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.\nOur aircraft fuel purchase agreements do not protect us against price increases or guarantee the availability of fuel. Additionally, some of our competitors may have more leverage than we do in obtaining fuel. We have and may continue to enter into a variety of option contracts and swap agreements for crude oil, heating oil, and jet fuel to partially protect against significant increases in fuel prices. However, such contracts and agreements do not completely protect us against price volatility, are limited in volume and duration in the respective contract, and can be less effective during volatile market conditions and may carry counterparty risk. Under the fuel hedge contracts we may enter from time to time, counterparties to those contracts may require us to fund the margin associated with any loss position on the contracts. Meeting our obligations to fund these margin calls could adversely affect our liquidity.\nDue to the competitive nature of the domestic airline industry, at times we have not been able to adequately increase our fares to offset the increases in fuel prices nor may we be able to do so in the future. Future fuel price increases, continued high fuel price volatility or fuel supply shortages may result in a curtailment of scheduled services and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages.\nOur maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages. In the past, we have incurred lower maintenance expenses because most of the parts on our aircraft were under multi-year warranties, but many of these warranties on JetBlue's existing fleet types have expired. If any maintenance provider with whom we have a flight hour agreement fails to perform or honor such agreements, we could incur higher interim maintenance costs until we negotiate new agreements. Furthermore we expect to continue to implement various fleet modifications over the next several years to ensure our aircraft's continued efficiency, modernization, brand consistency and safety. Our plans to continue to restyle our Airbus A320 aircraft with new cabins, for example, require significant modification time. These fleet modifications require significant investment over several years, including taking aircraft out of service for several weeks at a time.\nOur salaries, wages and benefits costs will increase as our workforce ages.\nAs our crewmembers' tenure with JetBlue matures, our salaries, wages and benefits costs increase. As our overall workforce ages, we expect our medical and related benefits to increase as well, despite an increased corporate focus on crewmember wellness.\nBecause we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the United States, the risks of doing business internationally, or in a particular country or region, could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits, or disrupt our business.\nWe currently operate in 107 airports in 26 countries around the world. Our available seat miles that take off or land outside the United States represented approximately 36% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Over the long term, we expect our international operations may account for an increasing portion of our total revenues and available seat miles.\nExpansion into new international emerging markets may have risks due to factors specific to those markets. Emerging markets are countries which have less developed economies and may be vulnerable to economic and political instability, such as significant fluctuations in gross domestic product, interest and currency exchange rates, civil disturbances, government instability, nationalization and expropriation of private assets, trafficking and the imposition of taxes or other charges by governments. The occurrence of any of these events in markets served by us and the resulting instability may adversely affect our business.\nWe have expanded and expect to continue to expand our service to countries in the Caribbean and Latin America, some of which have less developed legal systems, financial markets, and business and political environments than the United States, and therefore present greater political, legal, regulatory, economic and operational risks. We emphasize legal compliance and have implemented and continue to implement and refresh policies, procedures and certain ongoing training of crewmembers with regard to business ethics and compliance, anti-corruption policies and many key legal requirements; however, there can be no assurance our crewmembers or third party service providers in such locations will adhere to our code of business conduct, anti-corruption policies, other Company policies, or other legal requirements. If we fail to enforce our policies and procedures properly or maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions, we may\nbe subject to sanctions. In the event we believe or have reason to believe our crewmembers have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to investigation costs, potential penalties and other related costs which in turn could negatively affect our reputation, and our results of operations and cash flow.\nIn addition, to the extent we continue to grow our business both domestically and internationally, opening new markets requires us to commit a substantial amount of resources even before the new services commence. Expansion is also dependent upon our ability to maintain a safe and secure operation and requires additional personnel, equipment, and facilities.\nAs a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the United States, including:\n\u2022the costs of complying with laws, regulations, and policies (including taxation policies) of foreign governments relating to investments and operations, the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs, and the impact of various anti-corruption and other laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad;\n\u2022evolving local data residency requirements that require data to be stored only in and, in some cases, also to be accessed only from within, a certain jurisdiction;\n\u2022U.S. taxation of income earned abroad;\n\u2022import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as well as unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements, including imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export regulations, controls, and other trade restrictions;\n\u2022political and economic instability;\n\u2022fluctuations in GDP, interest and currency exchange rates, civil disturbances, government instability, nationalization and expropriation of private assets, trafficking and the imposition of taxes or other charges by governments;\n\u2022health and safety protocols, including global care and cleanliness certifications, at the airports in which we operate;\n\u2022the complexity of managing an organization doing business in many jurisdictions;\n\u2022uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for onerous contract clauses; and\n\u2022rapid changes in government, economic, and political policies; political or civil unrest; acts of terrorism; or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation.\nWhile these factors and the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could lower our revenues, affect our operations, increase our costs, reduce our profits, or disrupt our business. For example, in 2021 and 2020, our financial results were materially adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The occurrence of any of these events in markets served by us and the resulting instability may adversely affect our business.\nOur comparatively high aircraft utilization rate helps us keep our costs low, but also makes us vulnerable to delays and cancellations; such delays and cancellations could reduce our profitability and reputation.\nWe maintain a comparatively high daily aircraft utilization rate, which is the amount of time our aircraft spend in the air carrying passengers. High daily aircraft utilization is achieved in part by reducing turnaround times at airports so we can fly more hours on average in a day. Aircraft utilization is reduced by delays and cancellations from various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, security requirements, air traffic congestion, and unscheduled maintenance events. The majority of our operations are concentrated in the Northeast and Florida, which are particularly vulnerable to weather and congestion delays. Reduced aircraft utilization may limit our ability to achieve and maintain profitability as well as lead to customer dissatisfaction and reputational harm.\nOur business is highly dependent on the New York metropolitan market and increases in competition or congestion or a reduction in demand for air travel in this market, or governmental reduction of our operating capacity at JFK, would harm our business.\nWe are highly dependent on the New York metropolitan market where we maintain a large presence with approximately one-half of our daily flights having JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, Westchester County Airport, or Newburgh\u2019s Stewart International Airport as either their origin or destination. We have historically experienced an increase in flight delays and cancellations at these airports due to airport congestion which has adversely affected our operating performance and results of operations. Our business could be further harmed by an increase in the amount of direct competition we face in the New York metropolitan market or by continued or increased congestion, delays or cancellations. Our business would also be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in the New York metropolitan area, such as adverse changes in local economic conditions, health concerns, including COVID-19, negative public perception of New York City, acts of terrorism, or significant price or tax increases linked to increases in airport access costs and fees imposed on passengers.\nExtended interruptions or disruptions in service at one or more of our focus cities could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nOur business is heavily dependent on our operations in the New York Metropolitan area, particularly at JFK, and at our other focus cities in Boston, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, the Los Angeles basin, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Each of these operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic to other major cities. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one or more of our focus cities could have a serious impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be impacted by increases in airport expenses relating to infrastructure and facilities.\nIn order to operate within our current markets as well as continue to grow in new markets, we must be able to obtain adequate infrastructure and facilities within the airports we serve. This includes gates, check-in facilities, operations facilities, and landing slots, where applicable. The costs associated with these airports are often negotiated on a short-term basis with the airport authority and we could be subject to increases in costs on a regular basis with or without our approval. There is a possibility that airport authorities, suffering from revenue shortfalls due to the pandemic, may attempt to recover those shortfalls by passing along the costs or increasing rents or fees to airline tenants. In addition, our operations concentrated in older airports may be harmed if the infrastructure at those older airports fails to operate as expected due to age, overuse, or significant unexpected weather events.\nOur results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality, weather, and other factors.\nWe expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate due to seasonality including high vacation and leisure demand generally occurring on our Florida routes between October and April and on our western routes during the summer. Actions of our competitors and the impact of COVID-19 and travel restrictions may also contribute to fluctuations in our results. We are more susceptible to adverse weather conditions, including snow storms and hurricanes, as a result of our operations being concentrated on the East Coast, than some of our competitors. Our Florida and Caribbean operations are subject to hurricanes. As we enter new markets we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with any competitive responses to our entry by other airlines. Price changes in aircraft fuel as well as the timing and amount of maintenance and advertising expenditures also impact our operations. As a result of these factors, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indicator of our future performance. In addition, it is possible in any future period our operating results could be below the expectations of investors and any published reports or analysis regarding JetBlue. In such an event, the price of our common stock could decline, perhaps substantially. In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to disrupt traditional seasonality in our industry and geographies due to quarantines, rising case counts and changes in governmental travel related regulation.\nWe are subject to the risks of having a limited number of suppliers for our aircraft, engines, and our Fly-Fi\u00ae product.\nOur current dependence on five types of aircraft and engines for all of our flights makes us vulnerable to significant problems associated with the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan Engines, or PW1133G-JM engine, on our A321neo fleet, International Aero Engines, or IAE V2533-A5 engine on our Airbus A321 fleet, the International Aero Engines, or IAE V2527-A5 engine, on our Airbus A320 fleet, the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan Engines, or PW1524G-3, engine on our A220 fleet, and the General Electric Engines CF34-10 engine on our Embraer E190 fleet. This could include design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the manufacturers, or adverse perception by the public which would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft. Carriers operating a more diversified fleet are better positioned than we are to manage such events.\nOur Fly-Fi\u00ae service uses technology and satellite access through our agreement with Thales Avionics, Inc., or Thales. An integral component of the Fly-Fi\u00ae system is the antenna, which is supplied to us by Thales. If Thales were to stop supplying us with its antennas for any reason, we would have to incur significant costs to procure an alternate supplier. Additionally, if the satellites Fly-Fi\u00ae uses were to become inoperable for any reason, we would have to incur significant costs to replace the service.\nTariffs imposed on commercial aircraft and related parts imported from outside the United States, or tariffs that may be escalated over time, may have a material adverse effect on our fleet, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of the products and services that we purchase, including aircraft and related parts, are sourced from suppliers located outside the United States, and the imposition of new tariffs, or any increase in existing tariffs, by the U.S. government on the importation of such products or services could materially increase the amounts we pay for them.\nOn October 2, 2019, the World Trade Organization ruled that the United States could impose up to $7.5 billion in retaliatory tariffs in response to European Union subsidies to Airbus. On October 18, 2019, the United States imposed these tariffs on certain imports from the European Union, including an ad valorem duty of 10% on commercial aircraft and related parts. On February 14, 2020, the United States announced it would increase the tariff to 15% with an effective date of March 18, 2020. As of January 12, 2021, the tariff also applies to certain aircraft parts imported from specific countries into the United\nStates for consumption. These tariffs apply to aircraft and other parts that we are already contractually obligated to purchase. In March 2021, the U.S. Trade Representative announced a four-month suspension of the tariff that was followed by an announcement in June 2021 that the suspension will be extended for five years.\nThe imposition of these or any other tariffs could substantially increase the cost of, among other things, new aircraft and parts, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our fleet, business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also seek to postpone or cancel delivery of certain aircraft currently scheduled for delivery, and we may choose not to purchase in the future as many aircraft as we intended. In addition, should additional or different retaliatory tariffs be imposed, our business could be harmed. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on the size of our fleet, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Northeast Alliance with American Airlines is Subject to Challenge\nIn July 2020, we announced a strategic partnership with American Airlines Group Inc., designed to optimize our and American Airlines\u2019 networks through certain flights operated by us and American Airlines to and from John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport and Boston Logan International Airport, which we refer to as the Northeast Alliance. On September 21, 2021, the United States Department of Justice, along with the Attorneys General of each of the States of Arizona, California, and Florida, the Commonwealths of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against us and American Airlines concerning the Northeast Alliance. The lawsuit asserts and seeks an adjudication that the Northeast Alliance violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and that we and American Airlines should be permanently enjoined from continuing and restrained from further implementing the Northeast Alliance.\nWe and American Airlines established the Northeast Alliance to unlock capacity growth and customer benefits neither of us could achieve independently and to better compete in the northeast market. We believe the lawsuit is without merit, we, along with American Airlines, intend to defend this matter vigorously. If we are unsuccessful, the failure to achieve the intended benefits of the Northeast Alliance could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we are incurring costs associated with implementing operational and marketing elements of the Northeast Alliance, which would not be recoverable if we were required to unwind all or a portion of the Northeast Alliance.\nData and Information Security Related Risks\nOur reputation and business may be harmed and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, unlawful disclosure or misappropriation of, or unsanctioned access to, our customers\u2019, crewmembers\u2019, business partners\u2019 or our own information or other breaches of our information security.\nIn the current environment, there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. High-profile security breaches at other companies and in government agencies have increased in recent years, and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting businesses such as ours. Computer hackers routinely attempt to breach our networks. When the Company learns of security incidents, we investigate the incident, which includes making reports to law enforcement, as appropriate.\nWe also are aware that hackers may attempt to fraudulently induce crewmembers, customers, or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. We make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers or business providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer and crewmember information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems and those of service providers or business partners, that maintain and transmit customer and our information, may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or of a business partner, or impacted by deliberate or inadvertent actions or inactions by our crewmembers, or those of a business partner. The risk of cyberattacks to our Company also includes attempted breaches of contractors, business partners, vendors, and other third parties. As a result, personal information may be lost, disclosed, accessed, or taken without consent. We transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks and rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission and storage of confidential information.\nWhile the Company makes significant efforts to ensure the security of its computer network, we cannot provide any assurances that our efforts will defend against all cyberattacks. Any compromises to our security or computer network could have a material adverse effect on the reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition of the Company, and could result in a loss of customers. Additionally, any material failure by the Company to achieve or maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry, or PCI, security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on the Company's ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment. Any such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, customers\u2019, crewmembers\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information or other breach of our information security can\nresult in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a negative impact on our reputation, may lead to regulatory enforcement actions against us, and may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. The regulations in this area continue to develop and evolve. International regulation adds complexity as we expand our service and include more passengers from other countries.\nData security compliance requirements could increase our costs, and any significant data breach could disrupt our operations and harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to increasing legislative, regulator, and customer focus on privacy issues and data security. Our business requires the appropriate and secure utilization of customer, crewmember, business partner, and other sensitive information. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities (including cyberattacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, and the like), discovery of new vulnerabilities or attempts to exploit existing vulnerabilities in our systems, other data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access and store sensitive information. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyberattack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.\nFurthermore, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security in the U.S. and abroad, including requirements for varying levels of customer notification in the event of a data breach. Many of our commercial business partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that we must meet. In particular, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by the credit card companies, to comply with their highest level of data security standards. We will continue our efforts to meet the privacy and data security obligations; however, it is possible that certain new obligations may be difficult to meet and could increase our costs.\nA significant data security breach or our failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data security regulations or other data security standards may expose us to litigation, claims for contract breach, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The costs to remediate breaches and similar system compromises that do occur could be material. In addition, as cyber criminals become more frequent, intense, and sophisticated, the costs of proactive defensive measures may increase. Failure to address these issues appropriately could also give rise to additional legal risks, which, in turn, could increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, and cause us to incur further related costs and expenses.\nWe rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business; any failure of these systems could harm our business.\nWe are dependent on automated systems and technology to operate our business, enhance the JetBlue Experience, and achieve low operating costs. The performance and reliability of our automated systems and data centers is critical to our ability to operate our business and compete effectively. These systems include our computerized airline reservation system, flight operations system, telecommunications systems, website, maintenance systems, check-in kiosks, and our primary and redundant data centers. Our website and reservation system must be able to securely accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight information. These systems require upgrades or replacement periodically, which involve implementation and other operational risks. Our business may be harmed if we fail to operate, replace or upgrade our systems or data center infrastructure successfully.\nWe rely on third party providers of our current automated systems and data center infrastructure for technical support. If our current providers were to fail to adequately provide technical support for any one of our key existing systems or if new or updated components were not integrated smoothly, we could experience service disruptions, which could result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses, decrease our revenues and generally harm our business, reputation and brand. Furthermore, our automated systems cannot be completely protected against events beyond our control, including natural disasters, computer viruses, cyberattacks, other security breaches, or telecommunications failures. Substantial or sustained system failures could impact customer service and result in our customers purchasing tickets from other airlines. We have implemented security measures and change control procedures and have disaster recovery plans. We also require our third party providers to have disaster recovery plans; however, we cannot assure you these measures are adequate to prevent disruptions, which, if they were to occur, could result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses, decrease our revenues, and generally harm our business, reputation, and brand.\nHuman Capital Related Risks\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel or fail to maintain our company culture, our business could be harmed.\nWe compete against other major U.S. airlines for pilots, mechanics, and other skilled labor; some of them offer wage and benefit packages exceeding ours. As more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age, the U.S. airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage. We may be required to increase wages and/or benefits in order to attract and retain qualified personnel or risk considerable crewmember turnover. In addition, we have had crewmembers take opt out packages to reduce our costs and we may continue to lose crewmembers due to the impact of COVID-19 on aviation and we may lose crewleaders as a result of restrictions imposed under the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, and the American Rescue Plan Act. If we are unable to hire, train, and retain qualified crewmembers representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets, our business could be harmed and we may be unable to implement our growth plans. In addition, our business may be harmed if we lose too many individuals with institutional knowledge.\nWe believe one of our competitive strengths is our service-oriented company culture, which emphasizes friendly, helpful, team-oriented, and customer-focused crewmembers. Our company culture is important to providing high quality customer service and having a productive workforce in order to help keep our costs low. As we experience turnover, we may be unable to identify, hire, or retain enough people who meet the above criteria, including those in management or other key positions. Our company culture could otherwise be adversely affected by our growing operations and broader geographic diversity. If we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture, our competitive ability and our business may be harmed.\nWe may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs and the unionization of the Company\u2019s pilots and inflight crewmembers could result in increased labor costs.\nOur business is labor intensive and the unionization of any of our crewmembers could result in demands that may increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any of the different crafts or classes of our crewmembers could unionize at any time, which would require us to negotiate in good faith with the crewmember group\u2019s certified representative concerning a collective bargaining agreement. In addition, we may be subject to disruptions by unions protesting the non-union status of our other crewmembers. Any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could harm our business.\nIn general, unionization has increased costs in the airline industry. In 2014, our pilots voted to be represented by the Airlines Pilot Association, or ALPA and our first collective bargaining agreement was ratified by the pilots and became effective on August 1, 2018. In April 2018, JetBlue inflight crewmembers elected to be solely represented by the Transport Workers Union of America, or TWU. The NMB certified the TWU as the representative body for JetBlue inflight crewmembers. In November 2020, our inflight crewmembers voted to decline the ratification of a tentative collective bargaining agreement between JetBlue and TWU. We reached a final agreement for the first collective bargaining agreement which was ratified by our inflight crewmembers in December 2021.\nReputational Risks\nOur reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an accident or incident involving our aircraft.\nAn accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve significant potential claims of injured passengers or others in addition to repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service. We are required by the DOT to carry liability insurance. Although we believe we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident or incident. Substantial claims resulting from an accident or incident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results. Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully insured, could cause a public perception we are less safe or reliable than other airlines which would harm our business.\nOur business depends on our strong reputation and the value of the JetBlue brand.\nThe JetBlue brand name symbolizes high-quality friendly customer service, innovation, fun, and a pleasant travel experience. JetBlue is a widely recognized and respected global brand; the JetBlue brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. The JetBlue brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, relating to activities by our crewmembers, contractors, or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Increasingly the perception our customers and other stakeholders have about how we address the risks and opportunities we face related to DEI and climate change engagement, our role in the communities in which we operate and our relationship with our crewmembers will have an impact on our reputation. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\nFinancing and Financial Risks\nWe have a significant amount of fixed obligations and we will incur significantly more fixed obligations which could harm our ability to service our current obligations or satisfy future fixed obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our debt of $4.0 billion accounted for 51% of our total capitalization. In addition to long-term debt, we have a significant amount of other fixed obligations under operating leases related to our aircraft, airport terminal space, airport hangars, other facilities and office space. As of December 31, 2021, future minimum payments under non-cancelable leases and other financing obligations were approximately $2.9 billion for 2022 through 2026 and an aggregate of $1.1 billion for the years thereafter. T5 at JFK is under a lease with the PANYNJ that ends on the 28th anniversary of the date of beneficial occupancy of T5i. The minimum payments under this lease have been included in the future minimum payment totals above.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had commitments of approximately $7.5 billion to purchase 126 additional aircraft and related flight equipment through 2027, including estimated amounts for contractual price escalations and pre-delivery deposits. We may incur additional debt and other fixed obligations as we take delivery of new aircraft or finance unencumbered aircraft in our fleet and other equipment and continue to expand into new or existing markets. In an effort to limit the incurrence of significant additional debt, we may seek to defer some of our scheduled deliveries, sell or lease aircraft to others, or pay cash for new aircraft, to the extent necessary or possible. The amount of our existing debt, and other fixed obligations, and potential increases in the amount of our debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences to investors and could require a substantial portion of cash flows from operations for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.\nOur level of debt and other fixed obligations could:\n\u2022impact our ability to obtain additional financing to support capital expansion plans and for working capital and other purposes on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u2022divert substantial cash flow from our operations, execution of our commercial initiatives and expansion plans in order to service our fixed obligations;\n\u2022require us to incur more interest expense than we currently do if rates were to increase, since approximately 3% of our debt has floating interest rates; and\n\u2022place us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors with better access to capital resources or more favorable financing terms.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other fixed obligations will depend on our future operating performance and cash flows, which in turn will depend on prevailing economic and political conditions and financial, competitive, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We are principally dependent upon our operating cash flows and access to the capital markets to fund our operations and to make scheduled payments on debt and other fixed obligations. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations or from capital market activities to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due. If we fail to do so our business could be harmed. If we are unable to make payments on our debt and other fixed obligations, we could be forced to renegotiate those obligations or seek to obtain additional equity or other forms of additional financing.\nOur level of indebtedness may limit our ability to incur additional debt to meet future financing needs.\nWe typically finance our aircraft through either secured debt, lease financing, or through cash from operations. The impact on financial institutions from global economic conditions, including COVID-19, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to JetBlue as well as to prospective purchasers of our aircraft should we undertake to sell in the future, including financing commitments we have already obtained for purchases of new aircraft or financing or refinancing of existing aircraft. To the extent we finance our activities with additional debt, we may become subject to financial and other covenants that may restrict our ability to pursue our strategy or otherwise constrain our operations.\nOur liquidity could be adversely impacted in the event one or more of our credit card processors were to impose material reserve requirements for payments due to us from credit card transactions.\nWe currently have agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by our customers. Credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel which can occur several weeks after the purchase. Our credit card processing agreements provide for reserves to be deposited with the processor in certain circumstances. We do not currently have reserves posted for our credit card processors. If circumstances were to occur requiring us to deposit reserves, the negative impact on our liquidity could be significant which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to certain restrictions on our business as a result of our participation in governmental programs under the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, and the American Rescue Plan Act (collectively the \"Acts\").\nCARES Act - Payroll Support Program\nUnder the CARES Act, assistance was made available to the aviation industry in the form of direct payroll support (the \"Payroll Support Program\") and secured loans (the \"Loan Program\") from the United States Department of the Treasury (\"Treasury\").\nOn April 23, 2020, we entered into a Payroll Support Program Agreement (the \"PSP Agreement\") under the CARES Act with Treasury governing our participation in the Payroll Support Program. Under the Payroll Support Program, Treasury provided us with a total of approximately $963 million (the \"Payroll Support Payments\") consisting of $704 million in grants and $259 million in unsecured term loans. The loans have a 10-year term and bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at an annual rate of 1.00% until April 23, 2025, and the applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus 2.00% thereafter until April 23, 2030. The principal amount may be repaid at any time prior to maturity at par. As part of the agreement, JetBlue issued to Treasury warrants to acquire more than 2.7 million shares of our common stock under the program at an exercise price of $9.50 per share.\nCARES Act - Secured Loan Program\nUnder the CARES Act Loan Program, JetBlue had the ability to borrow up to a total of approximately $1.9 billion from Treasury. We entered into a loan and guarantee agreement (the \"Loan Agreement\") with Treasury and made an initial drawing of $115 million under the Loan Agreement on September 29, 2020. In connection with this initial drawing, we entered into a warrant agreement with Treasury, pursuant to which we issued to Treasury warrants to purchase approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $9.50 per share.\nOn September 15, 2021, the Company repaid the full amount of outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreement, which, together with accrued interest and fees, totaled approximately $118 million. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have a balance outstanding and all obligations under the Loan Agreement, including all pledges of collateral, were terminated in full.\nConsolidated Appropriations Act - Payroll Support Program 2\nOn January 15, 2021, we entered into a Payroll Support Program Extension Agreement with Treasury governing our participation in the federal Payroll Support Program for passenger air carriers under the United States Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the \u201cPayroll Support Program 2\"). Treasury provided us with a total of approximately $580 million (the \"Payroll Support 2 Payments\") under the program, consisting of $436 million in grants and $144 million in unsecured term loans, with funding received on January 15, 2021, March 5, 2021 and April 29, 2021. The loans have a 10-year term and bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at an annual rate of 1.00% until January 15, 2026, and the applicable SOFR plus 2.00% thereafter until January 15, 2031. In consideration for the Payroll Support 2 Payments, we issued warrants to purchase approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock to Treasury at an exercise price of $14.43 per share.\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act - Payroll Support Program 3\nOn May 6, 2021, we entered into a Payroll Support 3 Agreement with Treasury governing our participation in the federal payroll support program for passenger air carriers under Section 7301 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the \"Payroll Support Program 3\"). Treasury provided us with a total of approximately $541 million (the \"Payroll Support 3 Payments\") under the program, consisting of $409 million in grants and $132 million in unsecured term loans. The loans have a 10-year term and bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at an annual rate of 1.00% until May 6, 2026, and the applicable SOFR plus 2.00% thereafter until May 6, 2031. In consideration for the Payroll Support 3 Payments, we issued warrants to purchase approximately 0.7 million shares of our common stock to Treasury at an exercise price of $19.90 per share.\nThe warrants associated with each of the support programs described above will expire 5 years after issuance and will be exercisable either through net cash settlement or net share settlement, at our option, in whole or in part at any time.\nIn accordance with any grants and/or loans received under the Acts, we are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Acts which, among other things, includes the following: the requirement to use the Payroll Support Payments, the Payroll Support 2 Payments, and the Payroll Support 3 Payments exclusively for the continuation of payment of crewmember wages, salaries and benefits; the requirement that certain levels of commercial air service be maintained until March 1, 2022; the prohibitions on share repurchases and the payment of common stock dividends; and restrictions on the payment of certain executive compensation vary depending on the type of support received.\nThe substance and duration of restrictions to which we are subject under the grants and/or loans under the Acts, including, but not limited to, those outlined above, will materially affect the Company's operations, and the Company may not be successful in managing these impacts. Further, these restrictions could limit our ability to take actions that we otherwise might have determined to be in the best interest of our Company and our shareholders. In particular, limitations on executive compensation, which currently, depending on the form of aid, could extend through April 1, 2023, may impact the Company's ability to attract and retain senior management or attract other key employees during this critical time. We cannot predict\nwhether the assistance under any of these programs will be adequate to support our business for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic or whether additional assistance will be required or available in the future.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness from fixed obligations and may seek material amounts of additional financial liquidity in the short-term, and insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness from fixed obligations, including aircraft lease and debt financings, leases of airport property, secured loan facilities and other facilities, and other material cash obligations. In addition, we have substantial non-cancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines.\nIn addition, in response to the travel restrictions, decreased demand and other effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to have on our business, we may continue to seek material amounts of additional financial liquidity in the short-term, which may include the issuance of additional unsecured or secured debt securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities, the sale of assets, the entry into sale-leaseback transactions, as well as additional bilateral and syndicated secured and/or unsecured credit facilities, among other items. If our credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, the airline industry, or our business, our access to capital and the cost of any debt financing would be negatively affected. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such issuance, which may be in the near term, or that any such additional financing will be completed on favorable terms, or at all.\nAlthough our cash flows from operations and available capital, including the proceeds from financing transactions, have been sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments to date, our liquidity has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by the risk factors described herein. If our liquidity is materially diminished, we might not be able to timely pay our leases and debts or comply with certain operating and financial covenants under our financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations. Moreover, as a result of our recent financing activities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of financings and the aggregate amount of indebtedness with respect to which such covenants and provisions apply has increased, thereby subjecting us to more substantial risk of cross-default and cross-acceleration in the event of breach, and additional operating and financial covenants could become binding on us as we continue to seek additional liquidity. In addition, we have agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. Under certain of our credit card processing agreements, the financial institutions in certain circumstances have the right to require that we maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. Such financial institutions may require cash or other collateral reserves to be established or withholding of payments related to receivables to be collected, including if we do not maintain certain minimum levels of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In light of the affect COVID-19 is having on demand and, in turn, capacity, we have seen an increase in demand from consumers for refunds on their tickets, and we anticipate this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. Refunds lower our liquidity and put us at risk of triggering liquidity covenants in these processing agreements and, in doing so, could force us to post cash collateral with the credit card companies for advance ticket sales. We also maintain certain insurance- and surety-related agreements under which counterparties may require collateral. See \"Our liquidity could be adversely impacted in the event one or more of our credit card processors were to impose material reserve requirements for payments due to us from credit card transactions\".\nOur substantial level of indebtedness, particularly following the additional liquidity transactions completed and contemplated in response to the impacts of COVID-19, and non-investment grade credit rating, as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness, together with the effect the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the global economy generally and the air transportation industry specifically, may make it difficult for the Company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms, or at all.\nSee \"Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of this report for additional information regarding the Company's liquidity as of December 31, 2021.\nWe may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or our long-lived assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, we are required to test its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently where there is an indication of impairment. In addition, we are required to test certain of its other assets for impairment where there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.\nWe may be required to recognize losses in the future due to, among other factors, extreme fuel price volatility, tight credit markets, government regulatory changes, decline in the fair values of certain tangible or intangible assets, such as aircraft, route authorities, airport slots and frequent flyer database, unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment, as well as other uncertainties. For example, during the year ended December 31,\n2020, we recorded impairment charges of $273 million associated with our E190 fleet due to COVID-19. We can provide no assurance that a material impairment loss of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period, and the risk of future material impairments has been significantly heightened as result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our flight schedules and business. The value of our aircraft could also be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. Such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from the grounding of aircraft. A further impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Associated with the Airline Industry\nWe could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease or an environmental disaster that significantly affects travel behavior.\nAny outbreak of another disease or variants of COVID-19, which affect travel behavior, travel demand, or travel restrictions, or a similar public health threat, or fear of such an event could have a material adverse impact on airlines. In addition, outbreaks of disease could result in quarantines of our personnel, business partners and their suppliers, or an inability to access facilities or our aircraft, which could adversely affect our operations. Similarly, if an environmental disaster were to occur and adversely impact any of our destination cities, travel behavior could be affected and in turn, could materially adversely impact our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nCompliance with future environmental regulations may harm our business.\nMany aspects of airlines\u2019 operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulation. Since the domestic airline industry is increasingly price sensitive, we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations from our customers, which could adversely affect our business. Although we don't expect the costs of complying with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, no assurance can be made that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future will not have such an effect.\nFederal budget constraints or federally imposed furloughs due to budget negotiation deadlocks may adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations and financial position.\nMany of our airline operations are regulated by governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the DOT, FAA, CBP, and the TSA. If the federal government were to continue experiencing issues in reaching budgetary consensus in the future resulting in mandatory furloughs and/or other budget constraints, or if a government shutdown were to continue for an extended period of time, our operations and results of operations could be materially negatively impacted. The travel behaviors of the flying public could also be affected, which may materially adversely impact our industry and our business.\nWe may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change.\nConcern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and ground operations emissions. In October 2016, the ICAO passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. Annual international emissions reporting is required via CORSIA as of the 2019 reporting year, and offsetting compliance is scheduled to be implemented through multiple phases beginning in 2021. In 2020, given the impacts of COVID-19, which dramatically reduced 2020 emissions, ICAO agreed that the baseline from which the industry achieves carbon neutral growth would be from 2019 only, rather than an average of 2019 and 2020 as originally intended. ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but we expect compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs. In addition, climate change-related litigation and investigations have increased in recent years and any claims or investigations against us could be costly to defend and our business could be adversely affected by the outcome.\nChanges in government regulations imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions.\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements, both domestically and internationally, involving significant compliance costs. In the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and the agencies of the federal government, including, but not limited to, the DOT, FAA, CBP, and the TSA have issued regulations relating to the operation of airlines that have required significant expenditures. We expect to continue to incur expenses in connection with complying with government regulations. Additional laws including executive orders, regulations, taxes, and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel. If adopted or materially amended, these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices affecting the perception of the airline industry, reducing air travel demand and/or revenue, and increasing costs. We cannot assure you these and other laws including executive orders, regulations, or taxes enacted in the future will not harm our business.\nIn addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, has proposed changes to underground storage tank regulations that could affect certain airport fuel hydrant systems. In addition to the proposed EPA and state regulations, several U.S. airport authorities are actively engaged in efforts to limit discharges of de-icing fluid to local groundwater, often by requiring airlines to participate in the building or reconfiguring of airport de-icing facilities.\nA future act of terrorism, the threat of such acts or escalation of U.S. military involvement overseas could adversely affect our industry.\nActs of terrorism, the threat of such acts or escalation of U.S. military involvement overseas could have an adverse effect on the airline industry. In the event of an act of terrorism, whether or not successful, the airline industry would likely experience increased security requirements and significantly reduced demand. We cannot assure you these actions, or consequences resulting from these actions, will not harm our business or the industry.\nThe airline industry is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions.\nFundamental and permanent changes in the domestic airline industry have occurred over time as a result of several years of repeated losses, among other reasons. These losses resulted in airlines renegotiating or attempting to renegotiate labor contracts, reconfiguring flight schedules, furloughing, or terminating crewmembers, as well as considering other efficiency and cost-cutting measures. Despite these actions, several airlines have reorganized under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to permit them to reduce labor rates, restructure debt, terminate pension plans, and generally reduce their cost structure. Since 2005, the U.S. airline industry has experienced significant consolidation and liquidations. A global economic recession and related unfavorable general economic conditions, such as higher unemployment rates, a constrained credit market, housing-related pressures, and increased business operating costs can reduce spending for both leisure and business travel. Unfavorable economic conditions could also impact an airline\u2019s ability to raise fares to counteract increased fuel, labor, and other costs. It is possible that further airline reorganizations, consolidation, bankruptcies, or liquidations may occur in the current global economic environment, the effects of which we are unable to predict. We cannot assure you the occurrence of these events, or potential changes resulting from these events, will not harm our business or the industry.\nThe recent implementation of 5G wireless technology near the airports to which we operate could have an adverse effect on our continued safe operations.\nIn the United States, two major telecom providers activated 5G services across 46 markets on January 19, 2022 using frequencies in a radio spectrum called the C-band. These 5G frequencies may interfere with radio altimeters on our aircraft. Moreover, we expect other telecom providers to activate 5G services in the future. Because the 5G deployment involves a new combination of power levels, frequencies, proximity to flight operations, and other factors, we are closely monitoring any restrictions placed on our aircraft by the FAA. These safety restrictions could affect our flight schedules and operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operational reliability. The FAA is working with the Federal Communications Commission, the two major telecom providers, and airlines across the United States to reduce effects of this disruption. However, we cannot assure you that the effect of the 5G deployment will not cause undue disruptions to our operation.", "PERMNO": 89353, "SIC": 4512, "TIC": "JBLU"}
