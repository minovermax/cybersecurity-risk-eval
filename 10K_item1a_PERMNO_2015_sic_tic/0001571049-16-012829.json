RISK FACTORS\nThere are many factors that affect our business and the results of our operations, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of all known material risks that may cause the actual results of our operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. We encourage you to read this section carefully.\nOur business is subject to the cyclical nature of our industry and changes in consumer confidence and in economic conditions in general. Adverse changes or continued uncertainty with respect to these factors may lead to a downturn in our business.\nThe towing and recovery industry is cyclical in nature and historically the industry has been affected by changes in consumer confidence and in economic conditions in general. Concerns over the economic recovery and continued volatility and disruption in domestic and international capital and credit markets have historically caused significant erosion in consumer confidence. As a result, the overall demand for our products from our commercial customers has been negatively affected, and the level of future sales of our products is uncertain. A prolonged economic downturn, and slow or negative growth in the domestic and global economy, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future.\nOur demand from our customers and towing operators is affected by the availability of capital and access to credit.\nThe ability of our customers and of towing operators to purchase our products is affected by the availability of capital and credit to them. Our independent distributor customers rely on floor plan financing in connection with the purchase of our products, and the availability of that financing on acceptable terms has a direct effect on the volume of their purchases. Additionally, in many cases, a towing operator\u2019s decision to purchase our products from one of our distributors is dependent upon their ability to obtain financing upon acceptable terms. Volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, principally in the U.S. and Europe, has decreased the availability of capital to, and credit capacity of, our customers and towing operators. In addition, in the past, certain providers of floor plan financing have exited the market, which made floor plan financing increasingly difficult for our independent distributor customers to secure at those times. This reduced availability of capital and credit has negatively affected the ability and capacity of our customers and of towing operators to purchase towing and related equipment. This, in turn, has negatively impacted sales of our products. If customers are unable to access capital or credit, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products, and as a result, could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nOur dependence upon outside suppliers for our raw materials, including aluminum, steel, petroleum-related products and other purchased component parts, leaves us subject to changes in price and delays in receiving supplies of such materials or parts.\nWe are dependent upon outside suppliers for our raw material needs and other purchased component parts, and although we believe that these suppliers will continue to meet our requirements and specifications, and that alternative sources of supply are available, events beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the cost or availability of raw materials and component parts. Steel, aluminum, fuel and other commodity prices have historically been highly volatile. Shipment delays, unexpected price increases or changes in payment terms from our suppliers of raw materials or component parts could impact our ability to secure necessary raw materials or component parts, or to secure such materials and parts at favorable prices. To partially offset price increases for raw materials and component parts, we have, from time to time, implemented general price increases and cost surcharges. While we have attempted to pass these increased costs on to our customers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. Additionally, demand for our products could be negatively affected by the unavailability of truck chassis, which are manufactured by third parties and are frequently supplied by us, or are purchased separately by our distributors or by towing operators. Although we believe that sources of our raw materials and component parts will continue to be adequate to meet our requirements and that alternative sources are available, shortages, price increases or delays in shipments of our raw materials and component parts could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance, competitive position and reputation.\nOverall demand from our customers may be affected by increases in their fuel and insurance costs and changes in weather conditions.\nIn the past, our customers have experienced substantial increases in fuel and other transportation costs, and in the cost of insurance, and while many of these costs have fluctuated and, in the case of fuel, decreased in the past year, there can be no assurance that these costs will not continue to be volatile, or again increase, for our customers in the future. Additionally, our customers also have, from time to time, been subject to unpredictable and varying weather conditions which could, among other things, impact the cost and availability of fuel and other materials. Any of these factors could negatively affect the ability of our customers to purchase, and their capacity for purchasing, towing and related equipment, and, consequently, have a material negative effect upon our business and operating results.\nOur international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuation.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our net sales and production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe. As a result, our operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including risks of restrictive taxation policies, changing political conditions and governmental regulations. Also, a substantial portion of our net sales derived outside the United States, as well as salaries of employees located outside the United States and certain other expenses, are denominated in foreign currencies, including the British pound and the Euro. We are, therefore, subject to risk of financial loss resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates of these currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nOur competitors could impede our ability to attract or retain customers.\nThe towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive. Capital requirements for entry into the towing and recovery manufacturing industry have been relatively low, which could result in an increase in the number of competitors entering the industry. Competition for sales exists domestically and internationally at the manufacturer, distributor and towing-operator levels and is based primarily on product quality and innovation, reputation, technology, customer service, product availability and price. Competition for sales also comes from the market for used towing and recovery equipment. Certain of our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than us. If these competitors are able to make it more difficult for us to attract or retain customers, it could have a negative impact on our sales, revenue and financial performance.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to develop or acquire proprietary products and technology and assertions against us relating to intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nHistorically, we have been able to develop or acquire patented and other proprietary product innovations which have allowed us to produce what management believes to be technologically advanced products relative to most of our competition. However, certain of our patents have expired, and others will expire in the next few years, and as a result, we may not have a continuing competitive advantage through proprietary products and technology. If we are unable to develop or acquire new products and technology in the future, our ability to maintain market share, and, consequently, our revenues and operating results, may be negatively affected.\nThird parties may claim that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. If a competitor were to challenge our patents, or assert that our products or processes infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial litigation costs, be forced to design around their patents, pay substantial damages or even be forced to cease our operations, any of which could be expensive and/or have an adverse effect on our operating results. Third party infringement claims, regardless of their outcome, would not only consume our financial resources, but also would divert the time and effort of our management and could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products or services until resolution of the litigation.\nWe depend upon skilled labor to manufacture our products, and if we experience problems hiring and retaining skilled labor, our business may be negatively affected.\nThe timely manufacture and delivery of our products requires an adequate supply of skilled labor, and the operating costs of our manufacturing facilities can be adversely affected by high turnover in skilled positions. Accordingly, our ability to increase sales, productivity and net earnings will be limited to a degree by our ability to employ the skilled laborers necessary to meet our requirements. We must attract, train and retain skilled employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and increases in healthcare and other insurance costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to efficiently operate our facilities. In addition, while our employees are not currently members of a union, there can be no assurance that the employees at any of our facilities will not choose to become unionized in the future.\nA disruption in our information technology (\"IT\") systems could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our IT systems and our ability to update these systems in response to the changing needs of our business. We use our IT systems to collect and store confidential and sensitive data, including information about our business, our customers and our employees. As technology continues to evolve, we anticipate that we will collect and store even more data in the future and that our systems will increasingly use remote communication features that are susceptible to both willful and unintentional security breaches. We have incurred costs and expect to incur significant additional costs in order to implement security measures that we feel are appropriate to protect our IT systems. Nevertheless, future attacks could result in our systems or data being breached and/or damaged by computer viruses or unauthorized physical or electronic access. Such a breach could result in not only business disruption, but also theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets and/or unauthorized access to controlled data and personal information stored in connection with our human resources function. In the event of a breach in security that allows third parties access to personal information, we are subject to a variety of ever-changing laws on a global basis that may require us to provide notification to the data owners, and that may subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement or harm employee morale. Any interruption, outage or breach of our IT systems could adversely affect our business operations. To the extent that any data is lost or destroyed or any confidential information is inappropriately disclosed or used, it could adversely affect our competitive position or customer relationships, harm our business and possibly lead to claims, liability, or fines based upon alleged breaches of contract or applicable laws.\nThe effects of new regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business.\nOn August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements will require companies to perform due diligence, and disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We will have to perform due diligence to determine whether such minerals are used in the manufacture of our products. However, the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. The Company's supply chain is complex. As a result, we expect significant difficulty in determining the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all \u201cconflict minerals\u201d used in our products and disclosing that our products are \u201cconflict free\u201d (meaning that they do not contain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country). Implementation of these rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of some minerals necessary to the manufacture of our products and may affect the availability and price of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d capable of certification as \u201cconflict free.\u201d We may face reputational challenges from customers, investors or others if we are unable to verify the origins for all \u201cconflict minerals\u201d used in our products. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.\nOur sales to U.S. and other governmental entities through prime contractors are subject to special risks.\nWe act as a subcontractor for certain U.S. and other government programs. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulations and requirements of the U.S. and other government agencies and entities that govern these programs, including with respect to the award, administration and performance of contracts under such programs. Our U.S. and other government business is subject to the following risks, among others: (i) this business is susceptible to changes in government spending, which may reduce future revenues; (ii) most of our contracts with governmental entities through prime contractors are fixed-price contracts, and our actual costs on any of these contracts could exceed our projected costs, (iii) competition for the award of these contracts is intense, and we may not be successful in bidding on future contracts, and (iv) the products we sell to governmental entities are subject to highly technical requirements, and any failure to comply with these requirements could result in unanticipated retrofit costs, delayed acceptance of products, late or reduced payment or cancellation of the contract. We continue to work to secure additional U.S. and other governmental orders, but we cannot predict the success or timing of any such efforts.\nThe catastrophic loss of one of our manufacturing facilities could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster, civil unrest or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental and health and safety liabilities and requirements could require us to incur material costs.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the ground, air and water; the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; and the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties. In certain cases, these regulatory requirements may limit the productive capacity of our operations.\nEnvironmental and health-related requirements are complex, subject to change and have tended to become more and more stringent. Future developments could cause us to incur various expenditures and could also subject us to fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination or restore natural resources, liability for third party property damage or personal injury claims and the imposition of new permitting requirements and/or the modification or revocation of our existing operating permits, among other effects. These and other developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAny loss of the services of our key executives could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nOur success is highly dependent on the continued services of our management team. The loss of services of one or more key members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us.\nA product warranty or product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage, or an inability to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates, could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nWe are subject to various claims, including product warranty and product liability claims arising in the ordinary course of business, and may at times be a party to various legal proceedings incidental to our business. We maintain reserves and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms and our historical claims experience. If we manufacture poor quality products or receive defective materials, we may incur unforeseen costs in excess of what we have reserved in our financial statements. A successful product warranty, product liability or other claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, or the inability of us to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur stock price may fluctuate greatly as a result of the general volatility of the stock market.\nFrom time to time, there may be significant volatility in the market price for our common stock. Our quarterly operating results, changes in earnings estimated by analysts, if any, changes in general conditions in our industry or the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting us, including our ability to pay dividends, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive to acquire us in the future or may negatively affect our stock price.\nOur charter and bylaws contain restrictions that may discourage other persons from attempting to acquire control of us, including, without limitation, prohibitions on shareholder action by written consent and advance notice requirements regarding amendments to certain provisions of our charter and bylaws. In addition, our charter authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The rights and preferences for any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors, in its sole discretion and without shareholder approval, and the rights and preferences of any such preferred stock may be superior to those of common stock and thus may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock.\nThe requirements and restrictions imposed by our current credit facility could restrict our ability to operate our business and failure to comply with these requirements and restrictions could adversely affect our business.\nOur current credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and financial, affirmative and negative covenants for loan agreements of this kind. In addition, covenants under our current credit facility restrict our ability to pay cash dividends if the Company would be in violation of the minimum tangible net worth test or the leverage ratio test in the current loan agreement as a result of the dividend, among various restrictions. If we fail to comply with the requirements of our current credit facility, such non-compliance would result in an event of default. If not waived by the bank, such event of default would result in the acceleration of any amounts due under the current credit facility.", "PERMNO": 80828, "SIC": 3713, "TIC": "MLR"}
