{"cik": "1282266", "company": "WINDSTREAM HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe following discussion of \u201cRisk Factors\u201d identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial position. This information should be read in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. Additionally, this discussion should not be construed as a listing of risks by order of potential magnitude or probability to occur.\nCompetition in our business markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe serve business customers in markets across the country, competing against other communications providers and cable television companies for business customers. Competition in our business markets could adversely affect growth in business revenues and ultimately have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may be forced to lower prices or increase our sales and marketing expenses. In addition, we may need to continue to make significant capital expenditures to keep up with technological advances and offer competitive services. For additional information, see the risk factor \u201cRapid changes in technology could affect our ability to compete for business customers.\u201d\nIn certain markets where we serve business customers, we lease significant amounts of network capacity to provide service to our customers. We lease these facilities from companies competing directly with us for business customers. For additional information, see the risk factor \u201cIn certain operating territories, we are dependent on other carriers to provide facilities which we use to provide service to our customers.\u201d\nRapid changes in technology could affect our ability to compete for business customers.\nThe technology used to deliver communications services has changed rapidly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future. If we are unable to keep up with such changes, we may not be able to offer competitive services to our business customers. This could adversely affect our ability to compete for business customers, which, in turn, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain operating territories and/or at certain locations, we are dependent on other carriers to provide facilities that we use to provide service to our customers.\nIn certain markets and/or at certain locations, especially where we provide services to businesses, we may lease a significant portion of our network capacity from other carriers. These carriers may compete directly with us for customers. The prices for network services are contained in tariffs, interconnection agreements, and negotiated contracts. Terms, conditions and pricing for tariff network services may be changed, but they must be approved by the appropriate regulatory agency before they go into effect. For network service purchased pursuant to interconnection agreements, the rates, terms and conditions included therein are approved by state commissions while other network services, such as some high-capacity Ethernet services, may be obtained through commercial contracts subject to limited government oversight.\nThe availability and pricing of network services purchased via commercial agreements are subject to change without regulatory oversight. For interconnection agreement-based network services, if an agreement cannot be negotiated and we have to invoke binding arbitration by a state regulatory agency, that process is expensive, time consuming, and the results may not be favorable to us. In addition, rates for network services set forth above are susceptible to changes in the availability and pricing of the provider\u2019s facilities and services. Furthermore, in the event a provider becomes legally entitled to deny or limit access to capacity (or already is, as is the case with respect to certain services) or if state commissions allow the providers to increase rates for tariffed or interconnection agreement-based rates, we may not be able to effectively compete. In addition, if the provider does not adequately maintain or timely install these facilities, despite legal obligations, our service to customers may be adversely affected. As a result of all these items, our competitive position, our operations, financial condition and operating results could be materially affected.\nIncreases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers.\nVideo streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As utilization rates and availability of these services continue to grow, our high-speed Internet customers may use much more bandwidth than in the past. If this occurs, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity to avoid service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers.\nAlternatively, we may choose to implement reasonable network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, and these actions could negatively affect customer experience and increase customer churn.\nWhile we believe demand for these services may drive high-speed Internet customers to pay for faster broadband speeds, we may not be able to recover the costs of the necessary network investments. This could result in an adverse impact to our results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions and congestion in our networks and infrastructure may cause us to lose customers and incur additional expenses.\nOur customers depend on reliable service over our network. Some of the risks to our network infrastructure include physical damage to lines, security breaches, capacity limitations, power surges or outages, software defects and disruptions beyond our control, such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we will experience disruptions in our service due to factors such as cable damage, inclement weather and service failures of our third party service providers. Additionally, we could face disruptions due to capacity limitations as a result of changes in our customers\u2019 high-speed Internet usage patterns. These patterns have changed in recent years, for example through the increased usage of video, resulting in a significant increase in the utilization of our network.\nWe could experience more significant disruptions in the future. Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers or incur additional expenses or capital expenditures. Such results could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe value of our retained interest in CS&L could be impacted by future sales or distributions of shares of CS&L common stock, which could make it difficult to liquidate some or all of our retained interest at favorable market prices.\nIn the spin-off, we retained a passive ownership interest in approximately 19.6 percent of CS&L common stock. We intend to use all of our shares of CS&L to retire additional Windstream Services debt within 18 to 24 months from the date of the spin-off, subject to market conditions. In addition, some of the holders of shares of CS&L common stock are index funds tied to stock or investment indices or are institutional investors bound by various investment guidelines. Companies are generally selected for investment indices, and in some cases selected by institutional investors, based on factors such as market capitalization, industry, trading liquidity and financial condition. CS&L common stock may not qualify for those investment indices and may not meet the investment guidelines of some institutional investors. Consequently, these index funds and institutional investors may have to sell some or all of our common stock they receive in the spin-off.\nAny disposition by us or any other significant shareholder of CS&L of shares of CS&L common stock, or the perception in the market that such dispositions could occur, may cause the share price of CS&L common stock to fall. Any such decline could impair our ability to sell our shares of CS&L common stock in the future at favorable market prices, reduce the value of our retained interest in CS&L, and impact our plans to retire debt as planned in a debt for equity exchange.\nA change in ownership may limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.\nIf Windstream experiences a 50% or greater change in ownership involving shareholders owning 5% or more of its stock, it could adversely impact Windstream\u2019s ability to utilize its existing net operating loss carryforwards. The inability to utilize existing net operating loss carryforwards would significantly increase the amount of Windstream's annual cash taxes reducing the overall amount of cash available to be used in other areas of the business.\nIn September 2015, Windstream\u2019s board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d), under which Windstream shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 28, 2015 received one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock outstanding. The Rights Plan is designed to protect Windstream\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards from the effect of limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), if an ownership change should occur in the future. In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of Windstream\u2019s ownership by one or more \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined under IRC Section 382) has increased by more than 50 percent at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). Pursuant to the Rights Plan, if a shareholder (or group) acquires beneficial ownership of 4.9 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Windstream\u2019s common stock without prior approval of our Board of Directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions, the rights would become exercisable and entitle shareholders (other than the acquiring shareholder or group) to purchase additional shares of Windstream at a significant discount and result in significant dilution in the economic interest and voting power of acquiring shareholder or group. Although the Rights Plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the Rights Plan will prevent all transfers that could result in such an \u201cownership change\u201d. The Rights Plan is subject to shareholder approval at the Company\u2019s Annual Meeting in May. If the shareholders do not approve the Rights Plan, it will result in termination of the Rights Plan on September 17, 2016.\nIf the spin-off, and certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify CS&L for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations that we entered into with CS&L.\nWe received a private letter ruling from the IRS (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) to the effect that, on the basis of certain facts presented and representations and assumptions, the spin-off will qualify as tax-free under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. Although a private letter ruling generally is binding on the IRS, if the factual representations and assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the IRS Ruling. In addition, the IRS Ruling does not address certain requirements for tax-free treatment of the spin-off under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and our use of CS&L indebtedness and common stock to retire certain of our indebtedness (the \u201cdebt exchanges\u201d). Accordingly, the spin-off was conditioned upon the receipt of a tax opinion from our tax counsel with respect to the requirements on which the IRS did not rule, which concluded that such requirements also should be satisfied. The tax opinion was based on, among other things, the IRS Ruling, current law and certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by us and CS&L. Any change in currently applicable law, which may or may not be retroactive, or the failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects, could adversely affect the conclusions reached in the tax opinion. In addition, the tax opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS and/or the courts may not agree with the tax opinion. However, if the spin-off or the debt exchanges failed to qualify as tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may incur significant tax liabilities that could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the spin-off ultimately was determined to be taxable, then a shareholder that received shares of CS&L common stock in the spin-off would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares and could incur significant income tax liabilities. Such distribution would be taxable to such shareholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (including earnings and profits resulting from the recognition of gain by us in the spin-off). Any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. In addition, if the spin-off were determined to be taxable, we would recognize taxable gain.\nUnder the terms of the tax matters agreement that we entered into with CS&L, CS&L is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on us that arise from the failure of the spin-off and the debt exchanges to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, within the meaning of Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, as applicable, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to certain actions, events or transactions relating to CS&L\u2019s stock, indebtedness, assets or business, or a breach of the relevant representations or any covenants made by CS&L in the tax matters agreement, the materials submitted to the IRS in connection with the request for the IRS Ruling or the representations provided in connection with the tax opinion. CS&L\u2019s indemnification obligations to us are not limited by any maximum amount and such amounts could be substantial. If CS&L were required to indemnify us under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement, CS&L may be subject to substantial liabilities and there can be no assurance that CS&L will be able to satisfy such indemnification obligations.\nIn connection with the spin-off, CS&L will indemnify us and we will indemnify CS&L for certain liabilities. There can be no assurance that the indemnities from CS&L will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that CS&L\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and other agreements that we entered into with CS&L in connection with the spin-off, CS&L agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify CS&L for certain liabilities. However, third parties might seek to hold us responsible for liabilities that CS&L agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that CS&L will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations under these agreements. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from CS&L any amounts for which we are held liable to a third party, we may be temporarily required to bear the losses while seeking recovery. In addition, indemnities that we may be required to provide to CS&L could be significant and could adversely affect our business.\nWe are required to pay rent under the master lease with CS&L, and our ability to do so could be adversely impaired by results of our operations, changes in our cash requirements and cash tax obligations, or overall financial position; conversely, payment of the rent could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.\nWe are required to pay a portion of our cash flow from operations to CS&L pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the master lease. Our ability to pay the rent owed to CS&L could be adversely impaired by results of our operations, changes in our cash obligations and requirements, or general financial position. Additionally, our obligation to pay rent could impair our ability to fund our own operations, raise capital, make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the provisions of the master lease with CS&L could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe currently lease a significant portion of our telecommunications network assets, including our fiber and copper networks and other real estate, under the master lease with CS&L. Our failure to pay the rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of the master lease would result in an event of default regarding the master lease and also could result in a default under other agreements. Upon an event of default, remedies available to CS&L include terminating the master lease and requiring us to transfer the business operations we conduct at the leased assets so terminated (with limited exceptions) to a successor tenant for fair market value pursuant to a process set forth in the master lease and cooperate with CS&L to ensure that an operational facility is transferred to the successor tenant, dispossessing us from the leased assets, and/or collecting monetary damages for the breach (including rent acceleration), electing to leave the master lease in place and sue for rent and any other monetary damages, and seeking any and all other rights and remedies available under law or in equity. The exercise of such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nCyber security incidents could have a significant operational and financial impact.\nWe store customers\u2019 proprietary business information in our facilities through our colocation, managed services and cloud computing services. In addition, we maintain certain sensitive customer information in our financial and operating systems. While we have implemented data security polices and other internal controls to safeguard and protect against misuse or loss of this information, if their data were compromised through a cyber security incident, it could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we have implemented network and data security policies and other internal controls to safeguard and protect against malicious interference with our networks and information technology infrastructure and related systems and technology, as well as misappropriation of data and other malfeasance, but we cannot eliminate the risk associated with these types of occurrences. While we continue to adapt to new threats, increasing incidents of unsuccessful and successful \u201ccyber attacks\u201d, such as computer hacking, dissemination of computer viruses and denial of service attacks, as well as misappropriation of data, pose growing risks of a significant effect on our results of operations and financial condition and we cannot fully predict the evolution of such threats.\nWe cannot assure you we will continue paying dividends at the current rate.\nOur board of directors maintains a current dividend practice for the payment of quarterly cash dividends at a rate of $0.15 per share of common stock. This practice can be changed at any time at the discretion of the board of directors, and our common stockholders should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends. The amount of dividends we may distribute to stockholders is limited by restricted payment and leverage covenants in our credit facility and indentures, and, potentially, by terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.\nAny determination to pay cash dividends in the future is contingent on a variety of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, and our board of directors' continuing determination that such dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders and in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements. Also, the other risk factors described in this section could materially reduce the cash available from operations or significantly increase our capital expenditure requirements, and these outcomes could cause sufficient funds not to be available to support continuing payment of a dividend. Accordingly, if our board of directors were to change the current dividend practice or reduce the amount of dividends, such change could have a material and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to various forms of regulation from the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) and state regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate, which limit our pricing flexibility for regulated voice and high-speed Internet products, subject us to service quality, service reporting and other obligations and expose us to the reduction of revenue from changes to the universal service fund, the intercarrier compensation system, or access to interconnection with competitors\u2019 facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had operating authority from each of the 48 states and the District of Columbia in which we conducted local service operations, and we are subject to various forms of regulation from the regulatory commissions in each of these areas as well as from the FCC. State regulatory commissions have jurisdiction over local and intrastate services including, to some extent, the rates that we charge and service quality standards. The FCC has primary jurisdiction over interstate services including the rates that we charge other telecommunications companies that use our network and other issues related to interstate service. In some circumstances, these regulations restrict our ability to adjust rates to reflect market conditions and may affect our ability to compete and respond to changing industry conditions.\nFuture revenues, costs, and capital investment in our wireline business could be adversely affected by material changes to or decisions regarding applicability of government requirements, including, but not limited to, changes in rules governing intercarrier compensation, state and federal USF support, competition policies, and other pricing and requirements. Federal and state communications laws and regulations may be amended in the future, and other laws and regulations may affect our business. In addition, certain laws and regulations applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been, challenged in the courts and could be changed at any time. We cannot predict future developments or changes to the regulatory environment or the impact such developments or changes would have.\nIn addition, these regulations could create significant compliance costs for us. Delays in obtaining certifications and regulatory approvals could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses, and conditions imposed in connection with such approvals could adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers. Our business also may be affected by legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to, for example, assisting law enforcement, bolstering homeland and cyber-security, protecting intellectual property rights of third parties, minimizing environmental impacts, protecting customer privacy, or addressing other issues that affect our business.\nOur operations require substantial capital expenditures, and if funds for capital expenditures are not available when needed, this could affect our service to customers and our growth opportunities.\nWe require substantial capital to maintain our network, and our growth strategy will require significant capital investments for network enhancements and build-out. During 2015, we incurred $1,055.3 million in capital expenditures, and we expect to incur $800.0 million to $850.0 million in capital expenditures during 2016, excluding approximately $200.0 million in capital expenditures related to Project Excel, a capital program begun in late 2015 that accelerates our plans to upgrade our broadband network by the end of 2016 funded using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the data center business. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Financial Supplement to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe use a significant portion of our cash generated from operations to pay dividends to stockholders, which could limit our ability to make the capital expenditures necessary to support our business needs and growth plans. We expect to be able to fund required capital expenditures from cash generated from operations. However, other risk factors described in this section could materially reduce cash available from operations or significantly increase our capital expenditure requirements. If this occurs, funds for capital expenditures may not be available when needed, which could affect our service to customers and our growth opportunities.\nThe level of returns on our pension plan investments and changes to the actuarial assumptions used to value our pension obligations could have a material effect on our earnings and result in material funding requirements to meet our pension obligations.\nOur pension plan invests in marketable securities, including marketable debt and equity securities denominated in foreign currencies, which are exposed to changes in the financial markets. During 2015, the fair market value of these investments decreased from $1,042.0 million to $966.6 million primarily due to the return on assets held of $1.6 million, and routine benefit payments of $74.7 million. Returns generated on plan assets have historically funded a large portion of the benefits paid under our pension plan.\nFunding requirements may increase as a result of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements of the pension liability. We estimate that the long term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.0 percent, but returns below this estimate could significantly increase our contribution requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. Also, reductions in discount rates and extensions of participant mortality rates directly increase our pension liability and expose us to greater funding obligations in the future. Our earnings reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) may also be adversely affected due to our method of accounting for pension costs, whereby we immediately recognize gains and losses resulting from the return on plan assets as well as other changes in actuarial assumptions impacting our discount rate and mortality estimates.\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our cash flow and impair our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $5,170.5 million long-term debt outstanding, including current maturities. We may also obtain additional long-term debt to meet future financing needs or to fund potential acquisitions, subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, which would increase our total debt. Our substantial amount of debt could have negative consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nIncrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nRequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to interest and principal payments on outstanding debt, thereby limiting the availability of cash flow to fund future capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the telecommunications industry;\n\u2022\nPlace us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nLimit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity.\nIn addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future will depend in part on the satisfaction of the covenants in our credit facility and its other debt agreements. If we are unable to satisfy the financial covenants contained in those agreements, or are unable to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, the lenders and other parties to those arrangements could accelerate the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or have future borrowings available under our credit facility or from other sources sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments or to fund dividends and other liquidity needs. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt, including our credit facility, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to make payments or refinance our debt, or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as selling assets, issuing additional equity or debt, or negotiating with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt. Our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to do some of these things on favorable terms or at all.\nAs of February 22, 2016, Moody\u2019s Investors Service (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d), S&P and Fitch Ratings (\u201cFitch\u201d) had granted Windstream the following senior secured, senior unsecured and corporate credit ratings:\nFactors that could affect our short and long-term credit ratings include, but are not limited to, a material decline in our operating results, increased debt levels relative to operating cash flows resulting from future acquisitions, increased capital expenditure requirements, or changes to our dividend policy. In addition, we are not currently paying down a significant amount of debt. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded from current levels, we might incur higher interest costs on future borrowings, and our access to the public capital markets could be adversely affected.\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are frequently subject to routine audits by federal, state and local tax authorities. While we believe we have adequately provided for tax contingencies, these audits may result in tax liabilities that differ materially from what we have recognized in our consolidated financial statements.\nFurthermore, legislators and regulators at all levels of government may from time to time change existing tax rules and regulations or enact new rules that could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nCompetition in our consumer service areas could reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competitive pressures in our consumer service areas. If we continue to lose consumer households as we have historically, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. During 2015, our consumer households declined 5.4 percent.\nSources of competition include, but are not limited to, wireless companies, cable television companies and other communications carriers. Many of our competitors, especially wireless and cable television companies, have advantages over us, including substantially larger operational and financial resources, larger and more diverse networks, less stringent regulation and superior brand recognition. For additional discussion regarding competition, see \u201cCompetition\u201d in Item 1.\nCable television companies have aggressively expanded in our consumer markets, offering voice and high-speed Internet services in addition to video services. Some of our customers have chosen to move to cable television providers for their voice, high-speed Internet and television bundles. Cable television companies are subject to less stringent regulations than our consumer operations. For more information, refer to the risk factor, \u201cOur competitors, especially cable television companies, in our consumer markets are subject to less stringent industry regulations.\u201d\nWireless competition has contributed to a reduction in our voice lines and generally has caused pricing pressure in the industry. Some customers have chosen to stop using traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service. We anticipate that this trend toward solely using wireless services will continue, particularly if wireless prices continue to decline and the quality of wireless services improves.\nCompetition in our consumer markets could affect our revenues and profitability in several ways, including accelerated consumer household loss, reductions by customers in usage-based services or shifts to less profitable services and a need to lower our prices or increase marketing expenses to stay competitive.\nIf we are prohibited from participating in government programs, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are the recipient of a material amount of end user revenue and government funding under various government programs and also serve as a government contractor for services for various state, local and federal agencies. Our failure to comply with the complex government regulations and statutes applicable to the programs, or the terms of one or more of our government contracts, could result in our being suspended or disbarred from future government programs for a significant period of time or result in harm to our reputation with the government and possible restriction from future government activities. While we have implemented compliance programs and internal controls that are reasonably designed to prevent misconduct and non-compliance relating to the government programs and contracting, we cannot eliminate the risk that our employees, partners or subcontractors may independently engage in such activities.\nIf we are suspended or debarred from government programs, or if our government contracts are terminated for any reason, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.\nNew technologies may affect our ability to compete in our consumer markets.\nWireless companies are aggressively developing networks using next-generation data technologies, which are capable of delivering high-speed Internet service via wireless technology to a larger geographic footprint. If these technologies continue to expand in availability and reliability, they could become an effective alternative to our high-speed Internet services. In addition, cable operators may be able to take advantage of certain technology to deploy faster broadband speeds more rapidly than Windstream.\nIn addition to broadband technology, evolving voice technologies, such as over-the-top VoIP, may effectively compete with voice and long-distance services in our consumer markets.\nThese and other new and evolving technologies could result in greater competition for our voice and high-speed Internet services. If we cannot develop new services and products to keep pace with technological advances, or if such services and products are not widely embraced by our customers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCompetitors, especially cable television companies, in our consumer markets are subject to less stringent industry regulations, which could result in voice line and revenues losses in the future.\nCable television companies are generally subject to less stringent regulations than our consumer operations. Cable voice offerings and others are subject to fewer service quality and reporting requirements than our consumer operations, and their rates are generally not subject to regulation, unlike our consumer voice services. Our consumer areas also may be subject to \u201ccarrier of last resort\u201d obligations, which generally obligate us to provide basic voice services to any person within our service area regardless of the profitability of the customer. Our competitors in these areas are not subject to such requirements.\nBecause of these regulatory disparities, we have less flexibility in our consumer markets than our competitors. This could result in accelerated voice line and revenue losses in the future.\nDifferent interpretation and/or implementation of certain sections contained in the FCC\u2019s Intercarrier Compensation and Universal Service reform order could result in additional access revenue reductions.\nThe FCC\u2019s reform order adopted in 2011 provides that intrastate traffic that originates in VoIP format and is delivered by long distance carriers to us for termination will be assessed interstate access charges. During 2012, we coordinated with long distance carriers to transition to these reduced interstate access rates, and this transition resulted in further reductions on July 2, 2013.\nIn a subsequent order, the FCC determined that intrastate traffic we originate through the traditional telephone network and deliver to a customer served under a VoIP platform would be subject to interstate access charges beginning on July 1, 2014. As a result, we incurred additional access revenue reductions beginning on July 1, 2014. While we have petitioned the FCC to create a recovery mechanism, it has not yet done so. We expect additional reductions in intrastate originating access revenue as carriers report higher VoIP factors, but we cannot predict the impact at this time or whether some or all of the impact will be offset by an FCC recovery mechanism.\nIn 2015, we received approximately 6 percent of our revenues from state and federal USF, and any material adverse regulatory developments with respect to these funds could adversely affect our financial and operating condition.\nWe receive state and federal USF revenues to support the high cost of providing affordable telecommunications services in rural markets. Such support payments constituted approximately 6 percent of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. Pending regulatory proceedings to reform state and federal USF programs and our implementation of those reforms could, depending on the outcome, materially reduce our USF revenues.\nThe FCC is implementing the Connect America Fund, which was adopted in 2011 and includes a short-term (\u201cCAF Phase I\u201d) and a longer-term (\u201cCAF Phase II\u201d) framework. Windstream has elected to participate in both programs. To obtain the available funding, which is greater than the amount Windstream received from the legacy federal universal service program, Windstream has committed to offer broadband to a certain number of locations at specified speeds in particular portions of its service areas. This will require substantial capital investment and large scale construction by Windstream in rural and hard-to-serve geography. Costs of either Phase could exceed estimates by a material amount. The scale and scope of the network buildout to meet the obligations is challenging and complex. If Windstream is not able to fulfill its commitments, it would be required to return some funding and may be subject to additional penalties.\nAt the state level, the Public Utility Commission (\u201cPUC\u201d) in Texas, which is our largest source of universal service funding, recently adopted a rule that allows a provider to avoid statutorily mandated support reductions beginning in 2017 if the provider can make a showing of financial need. Under the financial needs test adopted by the Texas PUC, a provider can petition for continued support under a two-step process that considers the level of competition and a provider\u2019s expenses. Texas state USF revenues were $59.5 million in 2015. On December 28, 2015, we filed a petition for our Texas affiliate\u2019s large company support; this petition will be considered by the Texas PUC in a contested proceeding. We also may file petitions next year for continuation of small company support.\nWe are required to make contributions to state and federal USF programs each year. Most state and federal regulations allow us to recover these contributions by including a surcharge on our customers\u2019 bills. If state and/or federal regulations change, and we become ineligible to receive support, such support is reduced, or we become unable to recover the amounts we contribute to the state and federal USF programs from our customers, our results of operations and financial condition would be directly and adversely affected.\nWe may need to defend ourselves against lawsuits or claims that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from third parties, or we are named in lawsuits filed by third parties, claiming we have infringed or are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We may receive similar notices or be involved in similar lawsuits in the future. In certain situations, we may have the ability to seek indemnification from our vendors regarding these lawsuits or claims. If we cannot enforce our indemnification rights or if our vendors lack the financial means to indemnify us, these claims may require us to expend significant time and money defending our alleged use of the affected technology, may require us to enter into licensing agreements requiring one-time or periodic royalty payments that we would not otherwise have to pay or may require us to pay damages. If we are required to take one or more of these actions, it may result in an adverse impact to our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in responding to these claims, we may be required to stop selling or redesign one or more of our products or services, which could adversely affect the way we conduct our business.\nWeak economic conditions may decrease demand for our services.\nWe could be affected by economic conditions and downturns in the economy, especially in regards to our business customers. Downturns in the economy in the markets we serve could cause our existing customers to reduce their purchases of our services and make it difficult for us to obtain new customers.\nOur relationships with other communications companies are material to our operations and their financial difficulties may adversely affect us.\nWe originate and terminate calls for long distance and other voice carriers over our network in exchange for access charges. These access charges represent a significant portion of our revenues. Additionally, we are making significant capital investments to deploy fiber-to-the-tower and other network services in return for long-term revenue generating contracts. If these carriers go bankrupt or experience substantial financial difficulties and we are unable to timely collect payments from them, it may have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nKey suppliers may experience financial difficulties that may affect our operations.\nWindstream purchases a significant amount of equipment from key suppliers to maintain, upgrade and enhance our network facilities and operations. Should these suppliers experience financial difficulties, their issues could adversely affect our business through increased prices to source purchases through alternative vendors or unanticipated delays in the delivery of equipment and services purchased.\nAdverse developments in our relationship with our employees could adversely affect our business, our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 1,533 employees, or approximately 12 percent of all of our employees, covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our relationship with these unions generally has been satisfactory.\nWe are currently party to 23 collective bargaining agreements and one National Pension Agreement with several unions, which expire at various times. Of our existing collective bargaining agreements, nine agreements covering approximately 500 employees are due to expire in 2016. In addition, the national pension agreement covers approximately 500 employees. This agreement expired in 2010 but has been extended indefinitely, subject to the right of Windstream or the unions to terminate the agreement with 30 days notice. Historically, we have succeeded in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements without work stoppages; however, no assurances can be given that we will succeed in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements to replace the expiring ones without work stoppages. Increases in organizational activity or any future work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 91391, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "WINMQ"}
