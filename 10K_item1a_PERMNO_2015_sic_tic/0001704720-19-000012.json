{"cik": "1704720", "company": "Cannae Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFactors Relating to the Company's Corporate History and Structure\nWe are a holding company and will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries for cash.\nWe are a holding company whose primary assets are the securities of our portfolio companies. Our ability to pay interest on our outstanding debt, if any, and our other obligations and to pay dividends, if any, is dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to us (such ability of our subsidiaries also being subject to certain restrictions under their respective credit agreements and other debt instruments, as applicable). If our portfolio companies are not able to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to meet our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. The ability of the Cannae Holdings portfolio companies to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject.\nWe have a limited operating history as a separate company upon which you can evaluate our performance.\nWe have a limited operating history as a public company. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our business will be successful on a long-term basis. We may not be able to grow our businesses as planned and may not be profitable.\nWe may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe do not believe that we are subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"40 Act\"). We were formed for the purpose of effecting the Split-Off and for controlling, operating or holding, as applicable, the FNFV Group's business and investments, including the portfolio companies. We engage primarily in the business of managing and operating our controlled subsidiaries. Our officers and any employees who provide services to us pursuant to the terms of our\ncorporate services agreement with FNF devote their activities to the businesses of these portfolio companies. Our interest in the portfolio companies comprises substantially all of our assets and substantially all of our income, if any, is derived from restaurant revenue from our Restaurant Group, the revenue of T-System, and dividends and other distributions made on our interests in portfolio companies. Based on these factors, we believe that we are not an investment company under the 40 Act, including under Section 3(b)(1) of the 40 Act. If, at any time, we become primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, we could become subject to regulation under the 40 Act. Following any such change in our business and after giving effect to any applicable grace periods, we may be required to register as an investment company, which could result in significant registration and compliance costs, could require changes to our corporate governance structure and financial reporting, and could restrict our activities going forward. In addition, if we were to become inadvertently subject to the 40 Act, any violation of the 40 Act could subject us to material adverse consequences, including potentially significant regulatory penalties and the possibility that certain of our contracts would be deemed unenforceable.\nFactors Relating to the Restaurant Businesses\nGeneral macroeconomic factors, including unemployment, energy prices and interest rates, and certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant and bakery industries that are largely out of our restaurant businesses' control may materially and adversely affect consumer behavior and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions may materially and adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our restaurant businesses, which we also refer to as our Restaurant Group companies. Recessionary economic cycles, a protracted economic slowdown, a worsening economy, increased unemployment, increased energy prices, rising interest rates, a downgrade of the United States (\"U.S.\") government's long-term credit rating, financial market volatility and unpredictability or other national, regional and local regulatory and economic conditions or other industry-wide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and result in increased pressure with respect to our Restaurant Group companies' pricing, guest count levels and commodity costs, which could lead to a decline in our Restaurant Group companies' sales and earnings. Job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause customers to make fewer discretionary purchases, and any significant decrease in our Restaurant Group companies' guest counts or profit will negatively impact their financial performance. In addition, if gasoline, natural gas, electricity and other energy costs increase, or credit card, home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates, our Restaurant Group companies' customers may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine at restaurants, may spend less during each visit at our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or may choose more inexpensive restaurants. These factors could also cause the Restaurant Group companies to, among other things, reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings, close restaurants or delay the reimaging of the Restaurant Group companies' existing restaurant locations.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, including military action against any foreign state or local group located in a foreign state, heightened security requirements on local, regional, national or international economies or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure, such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems, could have on the Restaurant Group companies' operations, the economy or consumer confidence generally. Any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for the Restaurant Group companies due to security measures.\nThe business results of our Restaurant Group companies depend on a number of industry-specific factors as well, many of which are beyond the Restaurant Group companies' control. The full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer confidence, consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences, including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits, and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands. The performance of individual restaurants may also be materially and adversely affected by factors applicable to those restaurants, such as demographic trends, severe weather, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.\nUnfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our Restaurant Group companies' customers or industry could increase costs, reduce guest counts in some or all restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing, any of which could lower profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Restaurant Group companies could face significant competition for customers, real estate and employees and competitive pressure to adapt to changes in conditions driving customer demand. The Restaurant Group companies' inability to compete effectively may affect guest counts, sales and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive with a substantial number of restaurant operators that compete directly and indirectly with the Restaurant Group companies with respect to price, service, ambiance, brand, customer service, dining experience, location, food quality and variety and value perception of menu items and there are other well established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than the Restaurant Group companies. Some of our Restaurant Group companies'\ncompetitors advertise on national television, which may provide customers with greater awareness and name recognition than our Restaurant Group companies can achieve through their advertising efforts. There is also active competition for management personnel and attractive suitable real estate sites. Consumer tastes and perceptions, nutritional and dietary trends, guest count patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants often affect the restaurant business, and our Restaurant Group companies' competitors may react more efficiently and effectively to those conditions. For instance, prevailing health or dietary preferences or perceptions of our Restaurant Group companies' products may cause consumers to avoid certain menu items or products our Restaurant Group companies offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy, and such choices by consumers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our Restaurant Group companies face growing competition from the supermarket industry, with the improvement of their \"convenient meals\" in the deli and prepared food sections, from quick service and fast casual restaurants and online food delivery services as a result of food and beverage offerings by those food providers. As our Restaurant Group companies' competitors expand operations in markets where our restaurant businesses operate or expect to operate, we expect competition to intensify. If our Restaurant Group companies are unable to continue to compete effectively, their guest counts, sales and profit margins could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, customer spending patterns for the Restaurant Group companies' restaurants are generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year and lowest in the third quarter of the year. Sales activity during the holidays may affect seasonal sales volumes in some of the markets in which our restaurant businesses operate. The quarterly results of our Restaurant Group companies have been and will continue to be affected by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated costs (which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter), restaurant closures and exit-related costs, labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel, profitability of restaurants, especially in new markets, trends in comparable restaurant sales, changes in borrowings and interest rates, changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions, fluctuations in food and commodity prices, fluctuations in costs attributable to public company compliance and impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and property, fixtures and equipment. As a result of these and other factors, the Restaurant Group companies' financial results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nIf our restaurant businesses are unable to effectively grow revenue and profitability at certain of their locations, our Restaurant Group companies may be required to record impairment charges to their restaurant assets, the carrying value of their goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Restaurant Group companies assess the potential impairment of their long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is being used, an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life and significant negative industry or economic trends. Our Restaurant Group companies annually review and compare the carrying value of intangible assets, including goodwill, to the fair value. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any recorded impairment to our Restaurant Group companies' assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible or long-lived assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased commodity, energy and other costs could decrease our Restaurant Group companies' profit margins or cause the Restaurant Group companies to limit or otherwise modify their menus, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost, availability and quality of ingredients restaurant operations use to prepare their food is subject to a range of factors, many of which are beyond their control. A significant component of our restaurant businesses' costs will be related to food commodities, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, poultry, dairy products, oils, produce, fruit, flour and other related costs such as energy and transportation over which we may have little control, which can be subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, changes in international commodity markets and other factors. If there is a substantial increase in prices for these commodities, our Restaurant Group companies' results of operations may be negatively affected. In addition, the Restaurant Group companies' restaurants are dependent upon frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet certain specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality, and cost of ingredients, which would likely lower revenues, damage the Restaurant Group companies' reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nThe Restaurant Group companies are also subject to the general risks of inflation. The performance of our Restaurant Group companies' business is also adversely affected by increases in the price of utilities, such as natural gas, whether as a result of inflation, shortages or interruptions in supply, or otherwise. The Restaurant Group companies' business will also incur significant costs for insurance, labor, marketing, taxes, real estate, borrowing and litigation, all of which could increase due to inflation, changes in laws and regulations, competition or other events beyond the Restaurant Group companies' control.\nNegative customer experiences or negative publicity surrounding our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or other restaurants could adversely affect sales in one or more of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants and make our concepts less valuable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we believe our Restaurant Group companies' success depends significantly on their ability to provide exceptional food quality, outstanding service and an excellent overall dining experience, adverse publicity, whether or not accurate, relating to food quality, public health concerns, illness, safety, injury or government or industry findings concerning our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants, restaurants operated by other food service providers or others across the food industry supply chain could affect our Restaurant Group companies more than it would other restaurants that compete primarily on price or other factors. If customers perceive or experience a reduction in the food quality, service or ambiance at our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or in any way believe our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants have failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, the value and popularity of one or more of our Restaurant Group companies' concepts could suffer. Further, because our restaurant businesses rely heavily on \"word-of-mouth,\" as opposed to more conventional mediums of advertisement, to establish concept recognition, our restaurant businesses may be more adversely affected by negative customer experiences than other dining establishments, including those of our restaurant businesses' competitors.\nOur restaurant businesses could suffer due to reduced demand for our restaurant businesses' brands or specific menu offerings if our restaurant businesses are the subject of negative publicity or litigation regarding allegations of food-related contaminations or illnesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFood safety is a top priority, and our Restaurant Group companies dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that their customers enjoy safe, quality food products. Food-related contaminations and illnesses may be caused by a variety of food-borne pathogens, such as e-coli or salmonella, which are frequently carried on unwashed fruits and vegetables, from a variety of illnesses transmitted by restaurant workers, such as hepatitis A, which may not be diagnosed prior to being infectious, and from contamination of food by foreign substances. Contamination and food borne illness incidents could also be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers and distributors. As a result, we cannot control all of the potential sources of contamination or illness that can be contained in or transmitted from our Restaurant Group companies' food. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our Restaurant Group companies' brands and have a negative impact on their sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our Restaurant Group companies' competitors or at one of our Restaurant Group companies' suppliers could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our Restaurant Group companies' sales.\nIf any person becomes injured or ill, or alleges becoming injured or ill, as a result of eating our Restaurant Group companies' food, our Restaurant Group companies may temporarily close some restaurants or their bakery facilities, which would decrease their revenues, and our restaurant businesses may be liable for damages or be subject to governmental regulatory action, either of which could have long-lasting, negative effects on our restaurant businesses' reputation, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether our restaurant businesses are found liable. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.\nOur Restaurant Group companies' failure to comply with government regulation, and the costs of compliance or non-compliance, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Restaurant Group companies are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting their business. Each of their restaurants and their bakery division are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of federal, state and local governmental authorities, which may include, among others, alcoholic beverage control, health and safety, nutritional menu labeling, health care, environmental and fire agencies. Difficulty in obtaining or failure to obtain the required licenses, including liquor or other licenses, permits or approval could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area. Additionally, difficulties or inabilities to retain or renew licenses, or increased compliance costs due to changed regulations, could adversely affect operations at existing restaurants.\nWhile only approximately 9% of the Restaurant Group companies' consolidated restaurant sales in 2018 were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages, approximately 19% of the restaurant sales at Ninety Nine were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages in 2018. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each restaurant to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises and to provide service for extended hours and on Sundays. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of the Restaurant Group companies' restaurants, including minimum ages of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, training, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and the handling, storage and dispensation of alcoholic beverages. The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain liquor or food service licenses would adversely affect the restaurant's operations.\nOur restaurant businesses' operations are also subject to federal and state labor laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, governing such matters as minimum wages, overtime, tip credits and worker conditions. The Restaurant Group companies' employees who receive tips as part of their compensation, such as servers, are generally paid at a minimum wage rate, after giving effect to applicable tip credits. The Restaurant Group companies rely on their employees to accurately disclose the full amount of their tip income, and they base their Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax reporting on the disclosures provided to them by such tipped employees. Significant numbers of these personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage and thus, further increases in the federal or state minimum wage or other changes in these laws could increase our Restaurant Group companies' labor costs. Their ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increasing menu prices will depend on the responses of their competitors and customers.\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the \"PPACA\") was signed into law in the U.S. to require healthcare coverage for many uninsured individuals and expand coverage to those already insured. Starting in 2015, the PPACA required the Restaurant Group companies to offer healthcare benefits to all full-time employees (including full-time hourly employees) that meet certain minimum requirements of coverage and affordability, or face penalties. Continued compliance with the requirements of the PPACA and rising costs of healthcare may impose additional administrative costs. The costs and other effects of these healthcare requirements may significantly increase our Restaurant Group companies' healthcare coverage costs in future periods and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is also a potential for increased regulation of certain food establishments in the U.S., where compliance with Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (\"HACCP\") management systems may now be required. HACCP refers to a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of potential hazards from raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. Many states have required restaurants to develop and implement HACCP programs and the U.S. government continues to expand the sectors of the food industry that must adopt and implement HACCP programs. For example, the Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law in January 2011, granted the FDA new authority regarding the safety of the entire food system, including through increased inspections and mandatory food recalls. We anticipate that the new requirements may impact the restaurant industry. Additionally, our Restaurant Group companies' suppliers may initiate or otherwise be subject to food recalls that may impact the availability of certain products, result in adverse publicity or require the Restaurant Group companies' to take actions that could be costly for them or otherwise harm their business.\nIn addition, in order to develop and construct restaurants, the Restaurant Group companies must comply with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. Such regulations have not had a material effect on its operations to date, but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies could delay or prevent construction and increase development costs for new restaurants. The Restaurant Group companies are also subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other accessibility standards as mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (the \"ADA\"), which generally, among other things, prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. The ADA became effective as to public accommodations and employment in 1992. Pursuant to the ADA, our restaurant businesses may in the future have to modify restaurants, by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures for example, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. While these expenses could be material, the Restaurant Group companies' current expectation is that any such actions will not require substantial capital expenditures.\nThe Restaurant Group companies are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. There also has been increasing focus by the U.S. on other environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, and \"cap and trade\" initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, commodities, taxes, transportation and utilities, which could decrease our Restaurant Group companies' operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment.\nThe Restaurant Group companies are subject to laws and regulations relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, gift cards and consumer credit, protection and fraud, and any failure or perceived or alleged failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm their reputation or lead to litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our Restaurant Group companies' cost structure or lessen their operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal\nliability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase the Restaurant Group companies' exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nRestaurant companies, including our restaurant companies, are the target of claims and lawsuits from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Proceedings of this nature, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial costs and damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Restaurant Group companies and other restaurant companies have been subject to claims and lawsuits alleging various matters from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including those that follow. Claims and lawsuits may include class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, the sharing of tips amongst certain employees, overtime eligibility of assistant managers and failure to pay for all hours worked. Although our restaurant businesses will maintain what we believe to be adequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these matters. Accordingly, if our restaurant businesses are required to pay substantial damages and expenses as a result of these types or other lawsuits, such payments or expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOccasionally, our Restaurant Group companies' customers may file complaints or lawsuits against the Restaurant Group companies alleging that they are responsible for some illness or injury the customers suffered at or after a visit to one of the Restaurant Group companies' restaurants, including actions seeking damages resulting from food-borne illness and relating to notices with respect to chemicals contained in food products required under state law. Our Restaurant Group companies may also be subject to a variety of other claims from third parties arising in the ordinary course of their business, including personal injury claims, contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state laws. In addition, most of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants are subject to state \"dram shop\" or similar laws which generally allow a person to sue our restaurant businesses if that person was injured by a legally intoxicated person who was wrongfully served alcoholic beverages at one of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers. In addition, the Restaurant Group companies may also be subject to lawsuits from their employees or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits in the restaurant industry have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants.\nAdditionally, certain of the Restaurant Group companies' tax returns and employment practices are subject to audits by the IRS and various state tax authorities. Such audits could result in disputes regarding tax matters that could lead to litigation that would be costly to defend or could result in the payment of additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRegardless of whether any claims against the Restaurant Group companies are valid or whether they are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from their operations. In addition, such claims may generate negative publicity, which could reduce customer traffic and sales. Although our restaurant businesses will maintain what they believe to be adequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. Defense costs, even for unfounded claims, or a judgment or other liability in excess of our restaurant businesses' insurance coverage for any claims or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Restaurant Group companies rely heavily on information technology and any material failure, interruption, or security breach in their systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Restaurant Group companies rely heavily on information technology systems across their operations and corporate functions, including for order and delivery from suppliers and distributors, point-of-sale processing in their restaurants, management of their supply chains, payment of obligations, collection of cash, bakery production, data warehousing to support analytics, finance or accounting systems, labor optimization tools, gift cards, online business and various other processes and transactions, including the storage of employee and customer information. The Restaurant Group companies' ability to effectively manage their business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of their products will depend significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. In August 2015, the Restaurant Group companies upgraded their information systems using a third-party provider. However, the failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our restaurant businesses' operations, and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. Compliance with these requirements may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. In addition, customers and employees have a high expectation that our restaurant businesses will adequately protect their personal information. The majority of our restaurant\nbusinesses' restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. We and other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their customers has been stolen.\nIn addition, any breach in customer payment information could result in investigations by the U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force (\"ECTF\") and increased cost in our restaurant businesses' efforts to cooperate with the ECTF.\nThe Restaurant Group companies also maintain certain personal information regarding their employees. In addition to government investigations, the Restaurant Group companies may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of their customers' credit or debit card information or if customer or employee information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately. If the Restaurant Group companies fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a significant breach of customer, employee or company data, their reputation could be damaged and they could experience lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Additionally, if a person is able to circumvent the security measures intended to protect our Restaurant Group companies' employee or customer private data, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information and disrupt our restaurant businesses' operations. The Restaurant Group companies may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance their systems in order to prevent or remediate any such attacks.\nThe success of the Restaurant Group depends, in part, on its intellectual property, which we may be unable to protect.\nWe regard our service marks, including \"O'Charley's\", \"Ninety Nine\", \"Village Inn\", \"Legendary Baking\", and \"Bakers Square\", and other service marks and trademarks as having significant value and as being important factors in the marketing of our restaurants. We have also obtained trademarks for several of our menu items and for various advertising slogans. We are aware of names and marks similar to our service marks and trademarks used by other persons in certain geographic areas where we have restaurants. We believe such uses will not adversely affect us and our policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks.\nWe license the use of our registered trademarks and service marks to franchisees and third parties through franchise arrangements and licenses. The franchise and license arrangements restrict franchisees' and licensees' activities with respect to the use of our trademarks and service marks, and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks and service marks.\nOccasionally, third parties may assert that we are, or may be, infringing on or misappropriating their intellectual property rights. In these cases, we intend to defend against claims or negotiate licenses when we consider these actions appropriate. Intellectual property cases are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. If we become involved in this type of litigation, it could consume significant resources and divert our attention from business operations.\nIf we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, we could incur significant damages, be enjoined from continuing to use certain marks, or be required to obtain a license to continue using the affected marketing and promotional materials. A license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing our marketing plan to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impracticable.\nFactors Relating to Ceridian\nCeridian's solutions and business are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those regarding privacy, data protection, and information security. Any failure by Ceridian or its third party service providers, as well as the failure of its platform or services, to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCeridian is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including regulation by various federal government agencies, including the FTC, and state and local agencies. The United States and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security, and storage of Personally Identifiable Information (\"PII\") of individuals; and the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection, use and dissemination of data. Self-regulatory obligations, other industry standards, policies, and other legal obligations may apply to Ceridian's collection, distribution, use, security, or storage of PII or other data relating to individuals. In addition, most states and some foreign governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of PII. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with one another, other regulatory requirements, or Ceridian's internal practices. Any failure or perceived failure by Ceridian to comply with U.S., E.U., or other foreign privacy or security laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, or legal obligations, or any security incident that results in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release, or transfer of, PII may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity and could cause Ceridian's customers to lose trust in it, which could harm its reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet\ndetermine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on Ceridian's business. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation came into force, bringing with it a complete overhaul of E.U. data protection laws: the new rules supersede E.U. data protection legislation, impose more stringent E.U. data protection requirements, and provide for greater penalties for non-compliance. Changing definitions of what constitutes PII may also limit or inhibit Ceridian's ability to operate or to expand its business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. Also, some jurisdictions require that certain types of data be retained on servers within these jurisdictions. Ceridian's failure to comply with applicable laws, directives, and regulations may result in enforcement action against it, including fines and imprisonment, and damage to Ceridian's reputation, any of which may have an adverse effect on its business and operating results. Further, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice issued a ruling invalidating the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Framework, which facilitated transfers of PII to the United States in compliance with applicable E.U. data protection laws. In July 2016, the E.U. and the U.S. political authorities adopted the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, replacing the Safe Harbor Framework and providing a new mechanism for companies to transfer E.U. PII to the United States. U.S. organizations wishing to self-certify under the Privacy Shield must pledge their compliance with its seven core and sixteen supplemental principles, which are based on European Data Protection Law.\nIf Ceridian's service is perceived to cause, or is otherwise unfavorably associated with, violations of privacy or data security requirements, it may subject it or its customers to public criticism and potential legal liability. Public concerns regarding PII processing, privacy and security may cause some of its customers\u2019 end users to be less likely to visit their websites or otherwise interact with them. If enough end users choose not to visit Ceridian's customers\u2019 websites or otherwise interact with them, Ceridian's customers could stop using its platform. This, in turn, may reduce the value of its services and slow or eliminate the growth of its business. Existing and potential privacy laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security and increasing sensitivity of consumers to unauthorized processing of PII may create negative public reactions to technologies, products, and services such as Ceridians.\nEvolving and changing definitions of what constitutes PII and / or \u201cPersonal Data\u201d within the United States, Canada, the European Union, and elsewhere, especially relating to the classification of internet protocol, or IP addresses, machine or device identification numbers, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit Ceridian's ability to operate or to expand its business. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair Ceridian's ability to collect or to use information that it utilizes to provide email delivery and marketing services to its customers, thereby impairing its ability to maintain and to grow its customer base and to increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing, or disclosure of our customers\u2019 data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such information may limit our ability to develop new services and features.\nPrivacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign data protection regulations may reduce the effectiveness of Ceridian's applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCeridian's customers can use its applications to collect, to use, and to store PII regarding their employees, independent contractors, and job applicants. Federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of PII obtained from individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of Ceridian's customers, or to its business directly, may limit the use and adoption of Ceridian's applications and reduce overall demand, or lead to significant fines, penalties, or liabilities for any non-compliance with such privacy laws. Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause Ceridian's customers\u2019 workers to resist providing PII necessary to allow its customers to use its applications effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of Ceridian's applications in certain industries.\nAll of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect Ceridian's customers\u2019 ability to process, to handle, to store, to use, and to transmit demographic information and PII from their employees, independent contractors, job applicants, customers, and suppliers, which could reduce demand for our applications. The European Union and many countries in Europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations, which may impact Ceridian's ability to profitably operate in certain European countries.\nFurther, international data protection regulations trending toward increased localized data residency rules make transfers from outside the regulation\u2019s jurisdiction increasingly complex and may impact our ability to deliver solutions that meet all customers\u2019 needs. If the processing of PII were to be further curtailed in this manner, our solutions could be less effective, which may reduce demand for our applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional, or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If the processing of PII were to be\ncurtailed in this manner, our solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCeridian's indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCeridian's outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 consisted of (i) a Senior Term Loan in the original principal amount of $680.0 million and (ii) a $300.0 million committed Revolving Facility. The Senior Credit Facilities are secured substantially by all of our assets. The Senior Term Loan has a maturity date of April 30, 2025, and the Revolving Facility has a maturity date of April 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2018, we had $678.3 million outstanding principal under our Senior Term Loan and no principal outstanding under our Revolving Facility.\nCeridian's outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness it incurs may have important consequences for Ceridian, including, without limitation, that:\n\u2022\nCeridian may be required to use a substantial portion of its cash flow to pay the principal of and interest on its indebtedness;\n\u2022\nCeridian's indebtedness and leverage may increase its vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressures;\n\u2022\nCeridian's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and for general corporate and other purposes may be limited;\n\u2022\nCeridian's indebtedness may expose it to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of its borrowings, including and most significantly its borrowings under its Senior Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nCeridian's indebtedness may prevent it from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out its plans to expand its business; and\n\u2022\nCeridian's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and industry may be limited.\nUnder the terms of the agreements governing Ceridian's Senior Credit Facilities, Ceridian is required to comply with specified operating covenants and, under certain circumstances, a financial covenant applicable to the Revolving Facility, which may limit Ceridian's ability to operate its business as it otherwise might operate it. For example, the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, cross-defaults to certain material indebtedness, covenant defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, bankruptcy events, material judgments, material defects with respect to guarantees and collateral, and change of control. If not cured, an event of default could result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable, which would require Ceridian, among other things, to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, to refinance or restructure all or a portion of its indebtedness, to sell selected assets, and/or to reduce or to delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable Ceridian to service its debt, and any such financing or refinancing might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all. If Ceridian is not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its debt service obligations or are forced to take additional measures to be able to service its indebtedness, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAn information security breach of Ceridian's systems or the loss of, or unauthorized access to, customer information, failure to comply with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (\u201cFTC\u201d) ongoing consent order regarding data protection, or a system disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, market brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCeridian's business is dependent on its payroll, transaction, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. Ceridian relies on these systems to process, on a daily and time sensitive basis, a large number of complicated transactions. Ceridian electronically receives, processes, stores, and transmits data and personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) about its customers and their employees, as well as its vendors and other business partners, including names, social security numbers, and checking account numbers. Ceridian keeps this information confidential. However, Ceridian's websites, networks, applications and technologies, and other information systems may be targeted for sabotage, disruption, or data misappropriation. The uninterrupted operation of Ceridian's information systems and Ceridian's ability to maintain the confidentiality of PII and other customer and individual information that resides on its systems are critical to the successful operation of Ceridian's business. While Ceridian has information security and business continuity programs, these plans may not be sufficient to ensure the uninterrupted operation of its systems or to prevent unauthorized access to the systems by unauthorized third parties. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, Ceridian may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. These concerns about information security are increased with the mounting sophistication of social engineering. Ceridian's network security hardening may be bypassed by phishing and other social engineering techniques that seek to use end user behaviors to distribute computer viruses and malware into its systems, which might disrupt Ceridian's delivery of services and make them unavailable, and might also\nresult in the disclosure or misappropriation of PII or other confidential or sensitive information. In addition, a significant cyber security breach could prevent or delay Ceridian's ability to process payment transactions.\nAny information security breach in Ceridian's business processes or of its processing systems has the potential to impact its customer information and its financial reporting capabilities, which could result in the potential loss of business and Ceridian's ability to accurately report financial results. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, Ceridian could potentially miss a critical filing period, resulting in potential fees and penalties, or lose control of customer data, all of which could result in financial loss, a disruption of Ceridian's businesses, liability to customers, regulatory intervention, or damage to its reputation. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. If Ceridian's security measures are breached as a result of third party action, employee or subcontractor error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to customer data, Ceridian's reputation may be damaged, its business may suffer, and Ceridian could incur significant liability. Ceridian may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period of time. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are growing increasingly sophisticated. As a result, Ceridian may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nThis environment demands that Ceridian continuously improve its design and coordination of security controls throughout the company. Despite these efforts, it is possible that Ceridian's security controls over data, training, and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper disclosure of PII or other confidential information. Any issue of data privacy as it relates to unauthorized access to or loss of customer and/or employee information could result in the potential loss of business, damage to Ceridian's market reputation, litigation, and regulatory investigation and penalties. For example, in December 2009 a criminal hacked into Ceridian's discontinued U.S. payroll application. Following receipt of an \u201caccess letter\u201d in May 2010 from the FTC for a non-public review of the matter, Ceridian worked with the FTC and entered into a twenty-year consent order which became final in June 2011. Ceridian conceded no wrongdoing in the order and they were not subject to any monetary fines or penalties. However, in connection with the order, Ceridian is required to, among other things, maintain a comprehensive information security program that is reasonable and appropriate for its size, and complexity, and for the type of PII it collects. Ceridian is also required to have portions of its security program, which apply to certain segments of its U.S. business, reviewed by an independent third party on a biennial basis. Maintaining, updating, monitoring, and revising an information security program in an effort to ensure that it remains reasonable and appropriate in light of changes in security threats, changes in technology, and security vulnerabilities that arise from legacy systems is time-consuming and complex, and is an ongoing effort.\nThere may be other such security vulnerabilities that come to Ceridian's attention. The independent third party that reviews Ceridian's security program pursuant to the FTC consent order may determine that the existence of vulnerabilities in its security controls or the failure to remedy them in a timeframe they deem appropriate means that its security program does not provide a reasonable level of assurance that the security, confidentiality, and integrity of PII is protected by Ceridian (or that there was a failure to protect at some point in the reporting period). While Ceridian has taken and continues to take steps to ensure compliance with the consent order, if they are determined not to be in compliance with the consent order, or if any new breaches of security occur, the FTC may take enforcement actions or other parties may initiate a lawsuit. Any such resulting fines and penalties could have a material adverse effect on Ceridian's liquidity and financial results, and any reputational damage therefrom could adversely affect Ceridian's relationships with its existing customers and its ability to attain new customers. Ceridian's continued investment in the security of its technology systems, continued efforts to improve the controls within its technology systems, business processes improvements and the enhancements to its culture of information security may not successfully prevent attempts to breach Ceridian's security or unauthorized access to PII or other confidential, sensitive or proprietary information. In addition, in the event of a catastrophic occurrence, either natural or man-made, Ceridian's ability to protect its infrastructure, including PII and other customer data, and to maintain ongoing operations could be significantly impaired. Ceridian's business continuity and disaster recovery plans and strategies may not be successful in mitigating the effects of a catastrophic occurrence. Insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, Ceridian's insurance policies may not cover all claims made against them, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention. If Ceridian's security is breached, if PII or other confidential information is accessed, if Ceridian fails to comply with the consent order or if Ceridian experiences a catastrophic occurrence, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our investment in Ceridian.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations aimed at Ceridian or resulting from actions of its predecessor may result in significant financial losses and harm to its reputation.\nCeridian faces risk of litigation, regulatory investigations, and similar actions in the ordinary course of its business, including the risk of lawsuits and other legal actions relating to breaches of contractual obligations or tortious claims from customers or other third parties, fines, penalties, interest, or other damages as a result of erroneous transactions, breach of data privacy laws, or lawsuits and legal actions related to Ceridian's predecessors. Any such action may include claims for substantial or unspecified compensatory damages, as well as civil, regulatory, or criminal proceedings against Ceridian's directors, officers, or employees;\nand the probability and amount of liability, if any, may remain unknown for significant periods of time. Ceridian may be also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, and book and records examinations, from regulators and other authorities in the geographical markets in which Ceridian operates. A substantial liability arising from a lawsuit judgment or settlement or a significant regulatory action against Ceridian or a disruption in its business arising from adverse adjudications in proceedings against its directors, officers, or employees could have a material adverse effect on Ceridian's business, financial condition, and results or operations and ultimately the value of our investment in Ceridian.\nAdditionally, Ceridian is subject to claims and investigations as a result of its predecessor, Control Data Corporation (\u201cCDC\u201d), Ceridian Corporation, and other former entities for whom Ceridian is successor-in-interest with respect to assumed liabilities. For example, in September 1989, CDC became party to an environmental matters agreement with Seagate Technology plc (\u201cSeagate\u201d) related to groundwater contamination on a parcel of real estate in Omaha, Nebraska sold by CDC to Seagate. In February 1988, CDC entered into an arrangement with Northern Engraving Corporation and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in relation to groundwater contamination at a site in Spring Grove, Minnesota. In August 2017, Ceridian received notice of a mesothelioma claim related to CDC. Although Ceridian is fully reserved for the groundwater contamination liabilities, Ceridian cannot at this time accurately assess the merits of these claims, and cannot be certain if additional liabilities related to such predecessor companies will surface. Moreover, even if Ceridian ultimately prevails in or settles any litigation, regulatory action, or investigation, Ceridian could suffer significant harm to its reputation, which could materially affect its ability to attract new customers, to retain current customers, and to recruit and to retain employees, which could have a material adverse effect on Ceridian's business, financial condition, and results of operations, and ultimately, the value of our investment in Ceridian.\nThe failure of Ceridian's business to comply with applicable laws could result in substantial taxes, penalties and liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCeridian is subject to various laws and regulations, and its failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business. For example, Ceridian's customers remit employer and employee tax funds to its businesses. Ceridian processes the data received from its customers and remits the funds along with a tax return to the appropriate taxing authorities when due. Under various service agreements with its customers, Ceridian assumes financial responsibility for the payment of the taxes, penalties and liabilities assessed against its customers arising out of its failure to fulfill its obligations under its agreements with these customers, unless these taxes, penalties or liabilities are attributable to the customer's failure to comply with the terms of the agreement the customer has with Ceridian. These taxes, penalties and liabilities could, in some cases, be substantial and could adversely affect Ceridian's business and operating results. Additionally, Ceridian's failure to fulfill its obligations under its customer agreements could adversely affect Ceridian's reputation, its relationship with its customers and its ability to gain new customers. In addition, mistakes may occur in connection with this service. Ceridian and its customers may be subject to penalties imposed by tax authorities for late filings or underpayment of taxes.\nCeridian is subject to risks related to its international operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApproximately 30% of Ceridian's revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was obtained from companies headquartered outside of the United States, primarily from Canada. Ceridian's Canada operations provide certain HCM solutions for its Canadian customers. Ceridian is continuing to expand its international Cloud solutions into other countries. As such, Ceridian's international operations are subject to risks that could adversely affect those operations or its business as a whole, including:\n\u2022\ncosts of localizing products and services for foreign customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and increased expenses related to introducing corporate policies and controls in our international operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties with or inability to engage global partners;\n\u2022\nlonger sales and payment cycles;\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nadditional regulatory compliance requirements;\n\u2022\nexposure to legal jurisdictions that may not recognize or interpret customer contracts appropriately;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems, the tax cost on the repatriation of earnings, and changes in tax rates;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on transfer of funds, laws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property and other legal rights as compared to the United States;\n\u2022\npractical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic and political conditions; and\n\u2022\nchanges in currency exchange rates, and in particular, changes in the currency exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars.\nIn addition, we anticipate that customers and potential customers may increasingly require and demand that a single vendor provide HCM solutions and services for their employees in a number of countries. If we are unable to provide the required services on a multinational basis, there may be a negative impact on our new orders and customer retention, which would negatively impact revenue and earnings. Although we have a multinational strategy, additional investment and efforts may be necessary to implement such strategy. Some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.\nFactors Relating to T-System\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated at the local, state and federal levels. T-System's failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect T-System's business.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated and is constantly evolving due to the changing political, legislative and regulatory landscapes. In some instances, to the extent that they are subject to these laws and regulations, these regulations directly impact T-System's business. However, these regulations also impact T-System's business indirectly as, in a number of circumstances, T-System's solutions and services must be capable of being used by its customers in a way that complies with those laws and regulations, even though T-System may not be directly regulated by the specific healthcare laws and regulations. There is a significant number of wide-ranging regulations, including regulations in the areas of healthcare fraud, e-prescribing, claims processing and transmission, medical devices, the security and privacy of patient data, the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (\"ARRA\") meaningful use program, and interoperability standards, that may be directly or indirectly applicable to T-System's operations and relationships or the business practices of its customers.\nEconomic, market and other factors may cause a decline in spending for information technology and services by T-System's current and prospective customers which may result in less demand for its products, lower prices and, consequently, lower revenues and a lower revenue growth rate.\nThe purchase of T-System's information system involves a significant financial commitment by its customers. At the same time, the healthcare industry faces significant financial pressures that could adversely affect overall spending on healthcare information technology and services. For example, the recent actual and potential reductions in federal and state funding for Medicare and Medicaid has caused hospitals to reduce, eliminate or postpone information technology related and other spending. To the extent spending for healthcare information technology and services declines or increases slower than T-System's anticipates, demand for its products and services, as well as the prices it charges, could be adversely affected. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that T-System will be able to increase or maintain its revenues or its revenue growth rate.\nIf T-System's security is breached, it could be subject to liability, and clients could be deterred from using its products and services.\nT-System's business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including Protected Health Information (\"PHI\"), financial information and other sensitive information relating to its clients, company and workforce. As a result, T-System faces risk of a deliberate or unintentional incident involving unauthorized access to its computer systems or data that could result in the misappropriation or loss of assets or the disclosure of sensitive information, the corruption of data, or other disruption of its business operations. Similarly, denial-of-service, ransomware or other Internet-based attacks may range from mere vandalism of T-System's electronic systems to systematic theft of sensitive information and intellectual property. We believe that, in recent years, companies in T-System's industry have been targeted by such events with increasing frequency, primarily due to the increasing value of healthcare-related data.\nVarious risks could affect T-System's worldwide operations, exposing it to significant costs.\nT-System conducts operations in the United States, India, and the Philippines, either directly or through its service providers. Such worldwide operations expose T-System to potential operational disruptions and costs as a result of a wide variety of events, including local inflation or economic downturn, currency exchange fluctuations, political turmoil, terrorism, labor issues, natural disasters, unfavorable intellectual property protection, and pandemics. Any such disruptions or costs could have a negative effect on T-System's ability to provide its services or meet its contractual obligations, the cost of its services, client and user satisfaction, its ability to attract or maintain clients and users, and, ultimately, its profits.\nIf T-System is unable to effectively grow revenue and profitability we may be required to record impairment charges to their assets, the carrying value of their goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe assess the potential impairment of T-System's long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is being used, an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life and significant negative industry or economic trends. We annually review and compare the carrying value of intangible assets, including goodwill, to the fair value. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any recorded impairment to T-System's assets and there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFactors Relating to the Company's Corporate and Other Businesses\nCompetition and technology may erode the Corporate and Other business franchises and result in lower earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEach of the Corporate and Other businesses face intense competitive pressures within markets in which they operate. While we will manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including market and technology changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, future operating results will depend to some degree on whether our Corporate and Other businesses are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages. If our Corporate and Other businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline from current levels.\nThe Corporate and Other businesses, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, are involved in legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporate and Other businesses, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, are involved in pending and threatened litigation matters, some of which include claims for punitive or exemplary damages. These companies are also subject to compliance with extensive government laws and regulations related to employment practices and policies. The Corporate and Other businesses may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to their satisfaction, and these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to their business or operations. The defense of these actions may be both time consuming and expensive and their outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty. Determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant legal judgment. It is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporate and Other businesses' cash flows in a particular period or on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with, or changes in, laws or regulations applicable to the Corporate and Other businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporate and Other businesses will be subject to certain laws, such as certain environmental laws, takeover laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, escheat or abandoned property laws, and antitrust laws, that may impose requirements on us and them as an affiliated group. As a result, we could become jointly and severally liable for all or part of fines imposed on our Corporate and Other businesses or be fined directly for violations committed by these businesses, and such fines imposed directly on us could be greater than those imposed on such businesses. Compliance with these laws or contracts could also require us to commit significant resources and capital towards information gathering and monitoring thereby increasing our operating costs.\nSimilarly, the Corporate and Other businesses may be subject to contractual obligations which may impose obligations or restrictions on their affiliates. The interpretation of such contractual provisions will depend on local laws. Given that we do not control all of the Corporate and Other businesses and that they generally operate independently of each other, there is a risk that we could contravene one or more of such laws, regulations and contractual arrangements due to limited access and opportunities to monitor compliance. In addition, compliance with these laws or contracts could require us to commit significant resources and capital towards information gathering and monitoring thereby increasing our operating costs.\nWe need qualified personnel to manage and operate our Corporate and Other businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our Corporate and Other businesses. Our Corporate and Other businesses also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Changes in demographics, training requirements and the unavailability of qualified personnel could negatively impact our Corporate and Other businesses' ability to meet demands of customers to supply goods and services. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is important to all of our Corporate and Other businesses' operations. Although our Corporate and Other businesses have adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for goods and services may exacerbate the risk of not having sufficient numbers of trained personnel, which could have a negative impact on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nFactors Relating to the Company's Investments\nOur management may seek growth through acquisitions in lines of business that will not necessarily be limited to our current areas of focus or geographic areas. This expansion of our business subjects us to associated risks, such as the diversion of management's attention and lack of experience in operating such businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may make acquisitions in lines of business that are not directly tied to or synergistic with our current portfolio companies. Accordingly, we may in the future acquire businesses in industries or geographic areas with which management is less familiar than we are with our current businesses.\nThe acquisition and integration of any business we may acquire involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired business. Furthermore, acquisitions may:\n\u2022\ninvolve our entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience;\n\u2022\ninvolve difficulties in retaining the customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ninvolve difficulties and expense associated with regulatory requirements, competition controls or investigations;\n\u2022\nresult in a delay or reduction of sales for both us and the business we acquire; and\n\u2022\ndisrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our current business.\nTo complete future acquisitions, we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions. Moreover, we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings, would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition.\nFurther, an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation and amortization of deferred compensation charges, may require the amortization, write-down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs.\nWe may often pursue investment opportunities that involve business, regulatory, legal or other complexities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an element of our investment style, we may pursue unusually complex investment opportunities. This could often take the form of substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity. Our tolerance for complexity may present risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute; it may be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions; and such transactions may sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent liabilities. Any of these risks could harm our performance.\nThe loss of key personnel could impair our operating abilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will substantially depend on our ability to attract and retain key members of our senior management team and officers. If we lose one or more of these key employees, our operating results and in turn the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Although we will have employment agreements with many of our officers, there can be no assurance that the entire term of the employment agreement will be served or that the employment agreement will be renewed upon expiration.\nThe due diligence process that we undertake in connection with new acquisitions may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment.\nBefore making acquisitions, we will conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an acquisition, we will rely on the resources\navailable to us, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third party investigations. The due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to any opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including fraud) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such opportunity. Moreover, such an investigation will not necessarily result in the investment being successful.\nFactors Relating to the Split-Off\nWe may incur material costs as a result of our separation from FNF, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will incur costs and expenses not previously incurred as a result of our separation from FNF. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting or costs associated with complying with the federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, tax administration and human resources related functions.) Although FNF will continue to provide many of these services for us at no-cost (other than reimbursement of FNF's out-of-pocket costs and expenses) under the corporate services agreement for up to three years following the Split-Off. If the corporate services agreement is not mutually terminated by Cannae Holdings and FNF prior to the expiration of the initial three-year term, the corporate services agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms on mutually agreeable arm's length terms unless FNF and Cannae Holdings mutually agree to terminate the agreement. We cannot assure you that we will not incur third-party vendor costs or out-of-pocket expenses under the corporate services agreement that are material to our business. Moreover, we will have to develop internal departments/functions to perform the services at the end of the term of the corporate services agreement.\nOur company has overlapping directors and officers with FNF, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nFour of our executive officers, Brent B. Bickett, Richard L. Cox, Michael L. Gravelle and David Ducommun, are also employed by FNF or FNF's subsidiaries and two of our directors, William P. Foley, II and Richard N. Massey also serve on the boards of directors of FNF or its subsidiaries. Our executive officers and members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at FNF or any other public company have fiduciary duties to that company's stockholders. We also are party to a variety of related party agreements and relationships with FNF and certain of FNF's subsidiaries and FNF and subsidiaries of FNF have an ownership interest in Cannae Holdings. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with FNF and/or its respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, FNF or any of our or its respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nOur agreements with FNF were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of FNF.\nWe have a number of inter-company agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by FNF for certain of our businesses. In addition, we have entered into (i) a corporate services agreement with FNF, pursuant to which FNF provides to us certain \"back office\" services at no-cost (other than reimbursement of FNF's out-of-pocket costs and expenses), (ii) a voting agreement with FNF, pursuant to which FNF agrees to appear or cause all shares of Cannae Holdings common stock that FNF or its subsidiaries, as applicable, own after the Split-Off to be counted as present at any meeting of the stockholders of Cannae Holdings, for the purpose of establishing a quorum, and agrees to vote all of such Cannae Holdings shares (or cause them to be voted) in the same manner as, and in the same proportion to, all shares voted by holders of Cannae Holdings common stock (other than FNF and its subsidiaries), (iii) a registration rights agreement, pursuant to which FNF or its subsidiaries, as applicable, received registration rights with respect to the shares in Cannae held by FNF and (iv) a revolver note with FNF, pursuant to which Cannae Holdings may borrow revolving loans, the proceeds of which may be used for investment purposes and working capital needs, from FNF from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100.0 million. The terms of all of these agreements were established while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of FNF, and hence may not be the result of arm's length negotiations. We believe that the terms of these inter-company agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements after the Split-Off.\nFactors Relating to the Company's Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur charter, bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our charter and bylaws and provisions of the Delaware General Corporate Law (\"DGCL\"), could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, as applicable, even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders. For example, our charter and bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by us upon approval of our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may be removed from office only for cause and that any vacancy on our board of directors may only be filled by a majority of our directors then in office, which may make it difficult for other stockholders to reconstitute our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only upon the request of a majority of our board of directors or by our executive chairman, chief executive officer or president, as applicable;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominees;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by stockholders, which results in each director nominee elected by a plurality winning his or her seat upon receiving one \"for\" vote; and\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with one class being elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, control of Cannae.\nThese restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit stockholder value by impeding a sale of our company.\nFactors Relating to the Company's Investment in Dun & Bradstreet\nOur investment in D&B may expose us to certain risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nOn February 8, 2019, Cannae and an investment consortium (the \u201cConsortium\u201d) including CC Capital Partners LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners along with other investors completed the previously announced acquisition of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, a Delaware corporation (\"Dun & Bradstreet\" or \"D&B\")(the \"DNB Acquisition\"). Of our previously disclosed $900.0 million commitment to purchase common equity of the parent of Dun & Bradstreet, we retained and funded a $505.6 million investment, representing 24.5% of the outstanding common equity, and syndicated the remainder to other investors.\nRefer to discussion under Recent Developments in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for further information on the DNB Acquisition and related transactions.\nD&B\u2019s strategy is designed to drive long-term sustainable growth as one global company delivering content through modern channels to serve customer needs with their forward-leaning culture. The achievement of their strategic initiatives depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to their ability to maintain the integrity of their brand and reputation, customer demand for their products, the effect of macro-economic challenges on their customers and vendors, their reliance on third parties to provide data and certain operational services and their ability to protect their information technology. D&B may not be able to successfully implement their strategic initiatives in accordance with their expectations, or in the timeframe they desire, which may result in us not realizing our expected return on investment, or a negative return on investment.\nD&B has undertaken a strategic and operational review of their business to help them find ways to accelerate value realization, including certain cost saving initiatives. Based on this review, D&B intends to undertake certain strategic and cost saving initiatives, which they believe will help them to achieve this goal. They cannot guarantee they will be able to successfully implement these strategic or cost saving initiatives. Furthermore, they may be unable to achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, some or all of the benefits from such initiatives. Additionally, even if they achieve these goals, they may not receive the expected benefits of the initiatives, or the costs of implementing these initiatives could exceed the related benefits. If they are unable to successfully implement these initiatives, if these initiatives are not as successful as planned or if they do not receive the expected benefits of these initiatives, they may not be able to meet their value realization expectations, which may result in us not realizing our expected return on investment, or a negative return on investment.\nWe expect our investment will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting, through which we will record our proportionate share of their net earnings or loss in our consolidated financial statements. Equity-method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If our equity-method investment is not recoverable, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur company has overlapping directors with D&B, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nTwo of our directors, William P. Foley, II and Richard N. Massey also serve on the boards of directors of D&B or its parent and subsidiaries. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with D&B and/or its respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, D&B or any of our or its respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping director.", "PERMNO": 17036, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "CNNE"}
