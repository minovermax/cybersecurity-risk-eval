You should read carefully and consider all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. The risks below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below. Also, please read \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nMarket conditions for oil, natural gas and NGLs are highly volatile. A sustained decline in prices for these commodities could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth.\nPrices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and the occurrence of natural disasters;\n\u00b7\noverall domestic and global economic conditions;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic conditions in countries producing oil, natural gas and NGLs, including terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war;\n\u00b7\nactions of OPEC and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of increasing liquefied natural gas and exports from the United States;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy supply and energy consumption;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations, including regulations prohibiting or restricting our ability to apply hydraulic fracturing to our wells, and taxation;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts and alternative fuel requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of production and transportation facilities for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of refining capacity; and\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of, and consumer demand for, alternative fuels.\nGovernmental actions may also affect prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs. In the past, prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. Beginning in the latter half of 2014, oil prices declined precipitously, and continued to decline throughout 2015 as well as the start of 2016. Although oil prices rebounded somewhat in 2017, they declined again in the fourth quarter of 2018. Such downward volatility has\nnegatively affected the amount of our net estimated proved reserves and the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows of our net estimated proved reserves. We recorded proved property impairments of $6.6 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016, respectively, and we did not record a proved property impairment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, our revenue, profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, and continued price volatility and low commodity prices, or a sustained drop in prices such as during the fourth quarter of 2018, could continue to negatively affect our financial results and further impede our growth. In particular, sustained declines in commodity prices have and will:\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to enter into commodity derivative contracts at attractive prices;\n\u00b7\nreduce the value and quantities of our reserves, because declines in prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs would reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce;\n\u00b7\nreduce the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital; and\n\u00b7\nmake it uneconomical for our operating partners to commence or continue production levels of oil, natural gas and NGLs.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate\nour business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.\nThe aggregate amount of our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including the\nfollowing:\n\u00b7\nany failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nthe covenants contained in our debt agreements limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations and may limit our flexibility in operating our business;\n\u00b7\nthird parties\u2019 confidence in our ability to find and produce oil and natural gas could decline, which could impact our ability to execute on our business strategy;\n\u00b7\nit may become more difficult to retain, attract or replace key employees of SOG to perform work on our behalf, particularly if we engage in restructuring or recapitalization transactions;\n\u00b7\nwe may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u00b7\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially extended or further declines in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\nour suppliers, hedge counterparties, vendors, service providers and other counterparties could renegotiate the terms of our arrangements, terminate their relationship with us or require additional financial assurances from us; and\n\u00b7\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough cash to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIn addition, requests for credit assurances from our contractual counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, on January 4, 2019, one of our contractual counterparties requested irrevocable letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of approximately $17.1 million as credit assurance under the terms of certain gathering and processing agreements. We issued such letter of credit on January 10, 2019, reducing our borrowing and letter of credit availability under the Credit Agreement to less than $8 million. Other suppliers, hedge counterparties, vendors, service providers or other counterparties could require additional financial assurances from us under the terms of our respective agreements, which could result in further reductions to our borrowing and letter of credit availability or a diversion of cash on hand from capital expenditures or funding our business to providing security for our counterparties.\nIf we were to receive a report from our independent registered public accounting firm with our annual audited financial statements containing a going concern or like qualification or exception, this would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement, which may result in cross-defaults under our other debt obligations.\nThe Credit Agreement requires that our annual audited financial statements include a report from our independent registered public accounting firm without a going concern or like qualification or exception and without any qualification or exception to the scope of the audit. If we were to receive a report from our independent registered public accounting firm with our annual audited financial statements containing a going concern or like qualification or exception, it would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement, and the lender under the Credit Agreement would be able to accelerate the repayment of debt under the Credit Agreement and require cash collateralization of any outstanding letters of credit. If this were to occur, we would be unable to make further draws under the Credit Agreement unless the default was waived by the lender under the Credit Agreement. In addition, even if the lender were to waive compliance with this covenant under the Credit Agreement, failure to comply with certain operational covenants under the Credit Agreement relating to payment or performance of certain obligations under the Credit Agreement could result in other events of default. Any acceleration of our debt obligations under the Credit Agreement, if, together with any other accelerated debt obligations equal to or exceeding $20 million, would trigger cross-acceleration provisions under the indentures governing the 7.75% Notes and 6.125% Notes and, potentially, those under the indenture governing the 7.25% Senior Secured Notes as a result. As of February 26, 2019 we had approximately $17.1 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement and no borrowings. See \u201c-Restrictive covenants may adversely affect our operations.\u201d\nWe are evaluating a variety of strategic alternatives to improve our balance sheet and to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments; however, there is no guarantee that any such alternatives can be effectuated on acceptable terms or at all, and such alternatives could adversely affect our creditors and put our stockholders at significant risk of losing all of their respective investments in us.\nTo address our short and long term liquidity needs and to improve our balance sheet, in November 2018 we engaged a financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives. To meet our debt service obligations, capital expenditures and commitments and contingencies, we may undertake one or more actions, such as:\n\u00b7\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt and/or preferred stock;\n\u00b7\nselling assets;\n\u00b7\nfurther reducing or delaying our drilling program; or\n\u00b7\nseeking to raise additional capital through non-traditional lending or other private sources of capital.\nHowever, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance or restructure our debt and/or preferred stock or implement alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that implementing any such alternative financing plans would allow us to meet our debt or other obligations. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, in addition to constituting an event of default or potentially resulting in a cross default under our debt instruments, would likely result in a further reduction of our credit rating, which could further harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or obtain other financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur ability to restructure or refinance our debt and/or preferred stock will depend on numerous factors, including many beyond our control, such as the prevailing commodity price environment, the condition of the capital markets and the economy generally at such time. Any refinancing or restructuring of our debt and/or preferred stock could be at higher interest rates (or higher dividend rates or liquidation preferences, as applicable) and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nTo the extent inadequate cash flows from operations and other available capital resources require us to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, we may not be able to consummate these dispositions for fair market value, in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service or other obligations then due.\nThe terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the indentures governing our Senior Notes, may restrict us from adopting some of these alternative financing plans. For example, covenants in our existing debt instruments limit our ability to (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; (ii) grant or incur liens to secure indebtedness; (iii) consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person; or (iv) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including equity interests in subsidiaries.\nWe cannot guarantee that any particular refinancing or restructuring alternatives, such as refinancing our existing indebtedness or preferred stock, extending the maturity dates of such indebtedness, or otherwise amending the terms thereof, would be sufficient or could be effectuated at all. In addition, to effect any particular refinancing or restructuring plan we may need to seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This relief may include: (i) seeking bankruptcy court approval for the sale or sales of some, most or substantially all of our assets pursuant to section 363(b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and a subsequent liquidation of the remaining assets in the bankruptcy case; (ii) pursuing a plan of reorganization (where votes for the plan may be solicited from certain classes of creditors prior to a bankruptcy filing) that we would seek to confirm (or \u201ccram down\u201d) despite any classes of creditors who reject or are deemed to have rejected such plan; or (iii) seeking another form of bankruptcy relief, all of which involve uncertainties, potential delays and litigation risks. Such financing plans would likely adversely affect our creditors and be highly dilutive to holders of our common stock or preferred stock or possibly cause the loss of all or substantially all of their respective investments. Furthermore, in the event of a restructuring, recovery on holders\u2019 investment in the common stock would be subject to the liquidation preference (including accumulated and unpaid dividends) of the Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) and Series B Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d and, together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d).\nWe may need to seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to complete a strategic transaction that restructures or refinances our debt and/or preferred stock. If we seek bankruptcy relief, we expect that our common stockholders and preferred stockholders would likely receive little or no consideration for their interests. In addition, unsecured creditors would likely realize recoveries significantly less than the principal amount of their claims and, possibly, no recovery at all.\nWe believe that a strategic transaction that restructures or refinances our debt and/or preferred stock is critical to our continuing viability. We may need to seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to complete such a strategic transaction and address our liquidity needs. A chapter 11 case would have a significant impact on our business. It is impossible for us to predict with certainty the amount of time needed in order to complete an in-court restructuring. If we seek to implement a plan of reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we will need to negotiate agreements with our constituent parties regarding the terms of such plan and such negotiations could take a significant amount of time. A lengthy chapter 11 case would involve significant additional professional fees and expenses and divert the attention of management from operation of the business, as well as create concerns for customers, employees and vendors. There is a risk, due to uncertainty about the future, that (i) employees could be distracted from performance of their duties or attracted to other career opportunities; (ii) our ability to enter into new contracts or to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected; and (iii) we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing to sustain us during the chapter 11 case.\nIn addition, to successfully complete a restructuring under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we could require debtor-in-possession financing, the most likely source of which may be our existing lenders. If we were unable to obtain financing in a bankruptcy case or any such financing was insufficient to fund operations pending the completion of a restructuring, there would be substantial doubt that we could complete a restructuring.\nFurthermore, assuming we are able to develop a plan of reorganization, we may not receive the requisite acceptances to confirm such a plan and, even if the requisite acceptances of the plan are received, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm the plan. If we are unable to develop a plan of reorganization that can be accepted and confirmed, or if the Bankruptcy Court otherwise finds that it would be in the best interest of creditors, or if we are unable to obtain appropriate financing, our chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under chapter 7 of the U. S. Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which a trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nAs a result of the foregoing, if we seek bankruptcy relief, we expect that holders of our common stock and preferred stock would likely receive little or no consideration for their securities. In addition, unsecured creditors would likely realize recoveries significantly less than the principal amount of their claims and, possibly, no recovery at all. In particular, we believe that liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would likely result in no distributions being made to our shareholders and, possibly, unsecured creditors.\nEven if we are able to complete a strategic transaction to restructure or refinance our debt and/or preferred stock without seeking relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we may still be unsuccessful in our operating plan, particularly if oil and natural gas prices do not recover. If we are not successful in executing our current plan for operations, we may need to seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code notwithstanding the success of the strategic transaction. If we seek bankruptcy relief, we expect that holders of our common stock, preferred stock and, possibly, any unsecured notes that remain outstanding would likely receive little or no consideration.\nEven if a strategic transaction that restructures or refinances our debt and/or preferred stock without seeking relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is successful, but oil and natural gas prices do not recover or if we are not able to execute our current plan for operations, then we may still need to seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code notwithstanding the completion of the strategic transaction. If we were to seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code notwithstanding the completion of the strategic transaction, we expect that the holders of our shares of our common stock, preferred stock and, possibly, unsecured notes would likely receive little or no consideration for their securities.\nThe Company\u2019s derivative risk management activities could result in financial losses or reduced income.\nTo mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company\u2019s net cash provided by operating activities, support the Company\u2019s annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects, we have historically entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of the Company\u2019s production. These derivative arrangements are subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment, and the changes in fair market value of the contracts are reported in the Company\u2019s statements of operations each quarter, which may result in significant non-cash gains or losses. After the current hedges expire, there is significant uncertainty that we will be able\nto put new hedges in place that will provide us with the same benefit. These derivative contracts may also expose the Company to risk of financial loss (or reduced income) in certain circumstances, including when:\n\u00b7\nproduction is less than the contracted derivative volumes, in which case we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our hedging obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity;\n\u00b7\nthe counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contractual obligations;\n\u00b7\nthere is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge instrument, which limits the effectiveness of the hedge itself; or\n\u00b7\nthe derivative contracts limit the benefit the Company would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices.\nSuch financial losses (or reduced income) could materially impact our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther declines in commodity prices or unsuccessful exploration efforts may result in write-downs of our asset carrying values.\nAll property and acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending the determination of whether proved reserves have been discovered. If proved reserves are not discovered with an exploratory well, the costs of drilling the well are expensed. The capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, on a field basis, cannot exceed the estimated future net cash flows of that field. If the net capitalized costs exceed estimated future net revenues, we must write down the costs of each such field to our estimate of fair market value. Unproved properties are evaluated at the lower of cost or fair market value. Accordingly, a significant decline in commodity prices or unsuccessful exploration efforts could cause a future write-down of capitalized costs.\nWe review the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. The impairment analysis is based on then current commodity prices in effect. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties cannot be reversed at a later date even if commodity prices increase. As a result, substantial and sustained declines in oil and natural gas prices such as the one experienced during the fourth quarter of 2018 may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to fund planned capital expenditures.\nThe Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake involves risks associated with acquisitions and integration of acquired assets, and the intended benefits of the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake may not be realized.\nThe Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake involves risks associated with acquisitions and integrating acquired assets into existing operations, including that:\n\u00b7\nour senior management's attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations with respect to our Catarina area and our other legacy assets to the integration of the assets acquired in the Comanche Acquisition or other acquisition;\n\u00b7\nwe could incur significant unknown and contingent liabilities for which we have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to achieve the economies of scale that we expect from integrating the Comanche Assets or any other assets we may acquire into our existing operations;\n\u00b7\nthe assets acquired in the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake may not perform as well as we anticipate; and\n\u00b7\nunexpected costs, delays and challenges may arise in integrating the assets acquired in the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake into our existing operations.\nEven if we successfully integrate assets acquired in an acquisition, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we anticipate or we may not realize these benefits within the expected timeframe. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from the Comanche Assets or any other acquisition we may undertake, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe participate in oil and natural gas leases, including with respect to the Comanche Assets, with third parties who may not fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nIn some cases, we operate but own less than 100% of the working interest in the oil and natural gas leases on which we conduct operations, and other unrelated parties own the remaining portion of the working interest. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person, and many of these factors are outside of our control. We could be held liable for joint activity and gross exposure obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of other working interest owners. In addition, declines in oil and natural gas prices such as those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018 may increase the likelihood that some of these working interest owners are not able or elect not to fulfill their joint activity obligations. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs, and, in some cases, a partner may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs, we would likely have to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nWith respect to the Comanche Acquisition, for example, we are the operator of the asset and entered into a development agreement requiring us to complete and equip 60 wells in each annual period commencing on September 1, 2017 and continuing thereafter until September 1, 2022. However, we hold only an approximate 24% working interest in the asset. The risks associated with the joint activity obligations of the other working interest holders exacerbate the risks to us related to completing and equipping the required number of wells in a given year.\nUnder the terms of the Catarina lease and Comanche development agreement, we are subject to certain annual drilling and development requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in loss of our interests in the Catarina area that are not held by production or sizable default payments to Anadarko, respectively.\nIn order to preserve our exploration and development rights in the Catarina area, we are required to drill 50 wells per year (measured from July 1 to June 30). If we fail to meet the minimum drilling commitment under the terms of the lease for our Catarina properties (the \u201cCatarina Lease\u201d), we could forfeit our acreage under the Catarina Lease and rights to develop land not held by production (excluding, in certain instances, associated rights such as midstream assets). Up to 30 wells drilled in excess of the minimum 50 wells in a given 12-month period can be carried over to satisfy part of the 50-well requirement in the subsequent annual drilling period on a well-for-well basis. In addition, the Catarina Lease requires us to go no longer than 120 days without spudding a well, and, under the terms of the Catarina Lease, failure to do so could result in the forfeiture of our acreage under the Catarina Lease and rights to develop land not held by production (excluding, in certain instances, acreage upon which associated midstream assets are located).\nWe also entered into a development agreement (the \u201cDevelopment Agreement\u201d) with Anadarko regarding the Comanche Assets pursuant to which we committed to completing and equipping 60 wells per year for five years, in addition to other requirements in the leases that must be met in order to maintain our acreage position, or pay a penalty for the failure to do so. The Development Agreement permits up to 30 wells completed and equipped in excess of the annual 60-well requirement to be carried over to satisfy part of the 60-well requirement in subsequent annual periods on a well-for-well basis. If we fail to complete and equip the required number of wells in a given year (after applying any\nqualifying additional wells from previous years), we and Gavilan are jointly and severally liable to Anadarko for a default fee of $200,000 for each well we fail to timely complete and equip.\nOur drilling plans for our undeveloped leasehold acreage are subject to change based upon various factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as drilling results, prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Because of these uncertainties, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able meet our obligations under the Catarina Lease or the Development Agreement. If the Catarina Lease expires, we will lose our right to develop the related properties on this acreage, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to meet our obligations under the Development Agreement we and Gavilan will have to pay Anadarko the applicable default fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur agreements with Blackstone and GSO Capital Partners LP (\u201cGSO\u201d) restrict us from transferring our right, title and interest to the Comanche Assets.\nUnder the terms of the JDA, except under limited circumstances, neither we nor Blackstone can transfer any of our rights, title or interest to any asset or related assets (including any working interests) prior to the third anniversary of the JDA. In addition, under our agreements with GSO, we are not able to dispose of all or a substantial portion of the Comanche Assets without GSO\u2019s consent. These restrictions may prohibit us from taking advantage of certain opportunities, including our ability to sell these assets, which may arise from time to time.\nThe JDA contains right of first offer (\u201cROFO\u201d) and tag-along provisions that may hinder our ability to sell our interest in the Comanche Assets within our desired time frame or on our desired terms, and could delay or prevent an acquisition of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nUnder the terms of the JDA, both parties have a ROFO in the event that the other party intends to sell or otherwise transfer its interests. In addition, the JDA provides both parties with a tag-along right in the event that the other party intends to sell at least 35% of its total interests to a third-party purchaser (including upon a change of control transaction involving us). These features could limit third-party offers, inhibit our ability to sell our interests or adversely affect the timing of any sale of our interests and our ability to obtain the highest price possible in the event that we decide to market or sell our interests. In addition, the tag-along provisions of the JDA may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders or a third-party to replace or remove our current management or to acquire an interest in or engage in other corporate transactions with us, by subjecting certain corporate change of control transactions to a tag-along provision pursuant to which a third-party may be required to acquire Blackstone\u2019s interest in the Comanche Assets if it desires to enter into a corporate transaction with us.\nThe JDA establishes an operating committee for the Comanche Assets that keeps us from having unilateral control over many key variables of operation and development of the Comanche Assets and also provides for certain circumstances under which we could be removed as operator.\nThe JDA provides for the administration, operation and transfer of the jointly-owned Comanche Assets. Pursuant to the JDA, the parties thereto established an operating committee, which controls the timing, scope and budgeting of operations on the Comanche Assets (subject to certain exceptions). Although we are designated as operator of the Comanche Assets under the JDA, under certain circumstances (including upon a default under the JDA or a default and acceleration of certain of our debt agreements) we may be removed as operator and, furthermore, because we do not control the operating committee we do not have unilateral control over many key variables of the operation and development of the Comanche Assets, including the establishment of the budget and development plan for the Comanche Assets. There can be no assurance that Blackstone will continue its relationship with us in the future or that we will be able to pursue our stated strategies with respect to the Comanche Assets. Furthermore, Blackstone may (a) have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; (b) take actions contrary to our policies or objectives; (c) undergo a change of control; (d) experience financial and other difficulties; or (e) be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the JDA, which may affect our financial conditions or results of operations.\nSN Maverick is currently engaged in a disagreement with Blackstone regarding operations of the Comanche Assets under the JDA. Among other things, Blackstone has asserted that SN Maverick is in default of the JDA and Blackstone has the right to take over operations of the Comanche Assets. If Blackstone prevails in the disagreement, SN Maverick would lose its rights to operate the Comanche Assets and certain rights of SN Maverick under the JDA, including the ability to vote or appoint representatives to the operating committee or to transfer Comanche Assets, among others. Furthermore, Blackstone has attempted to initiate a division of operatorship under the JDA pursuant to which operatorship of the Comanche Assets would be divided between Blackstone (or a third-party operator) and SN Maverick in accordance with certain procedures specified in the JDA. Loss of operatorship of some portion or all of the Comanche Assets, or a finding that SN Maverick is in default under the JDA, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGSO consent is required for agreement of SN UnSub or SN UnSub\u2019s general partner to take certain actions, even if we believe the actions to be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nUnder the amended and restated limited partnership agreement of SN UnSub and limited liability company agreement of SN UnSub\u2019s general partner, we are not able to cause SN UnSub or its general partner to take or not to take certain actions unless GSO consents. GSO made a substantial investment (including contributions and other commitments) in SN UnSub at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition and, accordingly, has required that the relevant organizational documents of SN UnSub and its general partner contain certain features designed to provide it with the opportunity to participate in the management of SN UnSub and its general partner and to protect its investment in SN UnSub, as well as any other assets which may be substantially dependent on or otherwise affected by the activities of SN UnSub. These participation and protective features include a governance structure that consists of a board of directors of SN UnSub\u2019s general partner, only some of whom we appointed. Furthermore, in case of certain events of default under our debt instruments, our loss of operatorship under the JDA of the Comanche Assets in certain circumstances (including, potentially, as a result of the disagreement with Blackstone referred to above) and other specified events, GSO will gain control of the board of directors of SN UnSub and would have the right to sell SN UnSub or all or substantially all of its assets. Thus, unless GSO concurs, we will not be able to cause SN UnSub and its general partner to take or not to take certain actions, even though those actions may be in the best interest of SN UnSub, its general partner, or us. Furthermore, we, and GSO may have different or conflicting goals or interests which could make it more difficult or time-consuming to obtain any necessary approvals or consents to pursue activities that we believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur estimated reserves and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our estimated reserves.\nNumerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating reserves of oil, natural gas and NGLs and future production. It is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs in an exact way. Reserve engineering is complex, requiring subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs and assumptions concerning future prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, future production levels and operating and development costs. In estimating our reserves of oil, natural gas and NGLs, we and our independent reserve engineers make certain assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, including assumptions relating to:\n\u00b7\nprices for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nfuture production levels;\n\u00b7\ncapital expenditures;\n\u00b7\noperating and development costs;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of regulation;\n\u00b7\nthe accuracy and reliability of the underlying engineering and geologic data; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of funds.\nIf these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our estimates of our reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and our estimates of the future net cash flows from our estimated reserves could change significantly. For example, with other factors held constant, if the commodity prices used in our reserve report as of December 31, 2018 had decreased by 10%, then the Standardized Measure of our estimated proved reserves as of that date would have decreased by approximately $634 million, from approximately $2,475 million to approximately $1,841 million.\nOur Standardized Measure is calculated using unhedged prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates to take into account changes in our assumptions and the results of actual development and production.\nThe reserve estimates we make for wells or fields that do not have a lengthy production history are less reliable than estimates for wells or fields with lengthy production histories. A lack of production history may contribute to inaccuracy in our estimates of proved reserves, future production rates and the timing of development expenditures.\nOur estimated reserves of oil, natural gas and NGLs will naturally decline over time, and we may be unable to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future reserves of oil, natural gas and NGLs, production volumes and cash flow depend on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. Our estimated reserves of oil, natural gas and NGLs will naturally decline over time as they are produced. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to economically develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our own current and future production. If we are unable to do so, or if expected development is delayed, reduced or cancelled, our production and reserves will continue to decline. Our reduced expected capital investment in 2019 (or in 2020 or thereafter, if we do not increase our capital expenditures budget after 2019, as currently planned) may result in a future decline in our production and reserves. To the extent cash flow from operations and external sources of capital remain limited or become unavailable, our ability to make the necessary capital investments needed to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and natural gas reserves may be diminished. Over the long term, a continuing decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by negatively affecting our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets.\nApproximately 53% of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018 were PUDs requiring substantial capital expenditures and may ultimately prove to be less than estimated.\nRecovery of PUDs requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. At December 31, 2018, approximately 200.7 MMBoe of our total estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. The reserve data included in our reserve report assumes that substantial capital expenditures will be made to develop non-producing reserves over a period of five years. The calculation of our estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 assumed that we would spend $1.9 million for plugging and abandonment costs and an estimated $100 to $150 million during 2019, with our capital expenditures increasing in 2020 and thereafter to amounts comparable to our historic (pre-2019) levels, to develop our estimated PUDs. Although cost and reserve estimates attributable to our oil and natural gas reserves have been prepared in accordance with industry standards, we cannot be sure that the estimated costs or capital expenditures will prove to be accurate. Continued declines in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated PUDs and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. As a result of lower oil and natural gas prices or for other reasons we did not anticipate or which are beyond our control, we may reduce the budgeted capital expenditures for the development of undeveloped reserves in 2019 or in later years. Delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves. Furthermore, our drilling efforts may be delayed or unsuccessful and actual reserves may prove to be less than current reserve estimates, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and future cash flows.\nDeveloping and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are costly and high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost of developing, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a well. Additionally, drilling wells with no or sub-economic levels of production (dry holes) will negatively impact our financial position. In addition, our use of 2D and 3D seismic data and visualization techniques to identify subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures and requires additional pre-development expenditures. Furthermore, our development and production operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:\n\u00b7\nhigh costs, shortages or delivery delays of rigs, equipment, labor or other services;\n\u00b7\ncomposition of sour gas, including sulfur and mercaptan content;\n\u00b7\nunexpected operational events and conditions;\n\u00b7\nreductions in prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nincreases in severance taxes;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nfacility or equipment malfunctions and equipment failures or accidents, including acceleration of deterioration of our facilities and equipment due to the highly corrosive nature of sour gas;\n\u00b7\ntitle problems;\n\u00b7\npipe or cement failures, casing collapses or other downhole failures;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with ever-changing environmental and other governmental requirements;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as chemical or hydrocarbon leaks or spills, salt water leaks or spills, pipeline ruptures, discharges of toxic gases or other releases of hazardous substances;\n\u00b7\nlost or damaged oilfield development and service tools;\n\u00b7\nunusual or unexpected geological formations and pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u00b7\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u00b7\nfires, blowouts, surface craterings and explosions;\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, NGLs or well fluids;\n\u00b7\nloss of leases due to incorrect payment of royalties;\n\u00b7\nlimited availability of financing on acceptable terms, or at all; and\n\u00b7\nother hazards, including those associated with sour gas such as an accidental discharge of hydrogen sulfide gas, that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations.\nIf any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field, we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field, or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion operations. Hydraulic fracturing has become subject to increased public scrutiny and recent changes in federal and state law, as well as proposed legislative changes, could significantly restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing. Such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from dense subsurface rock formations and, in the event of local prohibitions against commercial production of natural gas, may preclude our ability to drill wells. In addition, such laws could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. If hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA or other federal agencies, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements and result in permitting delays, financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, more stringent plugging and abandonment requirements and potential increases in costs. Please read \u201c-Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation-Water and Other Water Discharges and Spills.\u201d\nAdditionally, hydraulic fracturing, drilling, transportation and processing of hydrocarbons bear an inherent risk of loss of containment. Potential consequences include loss of reserves, loss of production, loss of economic value associated with the affected wellbore, contamination of soil, ground water, and surface water, as well as potential fines, penalties or damages associated with any of the foregoing consequences.\nTrading in our common stock on the NYSE was suspended on February 20, 2019, and the NYSE has notified us that our common stock is subject to delisting proceedings. At this time, we expect that the NYSE could file a Form 25 to delist our common stock as early as March 7, 2019. Our common stock is quoted only in the over-the-counter market, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity.\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company received written notice from the NYSE that the average closing price of its common stock over a period of 30 consecutive trading days was below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum average closing price per share required to maintain listing on the NYSE under Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (the \u201cNYSE LCM\u201d). In accordance with applicable NYSE procedures, the Company notified the NYSE of its intent to pursue actions to meet the minimum average share price requirement and restore its compliance with the relevant standards required in Section 802.01C within the six-month period allowed by the NYSE.\nAdditionally, on January 3, 2019, the Company received written notice from the NYSE that the decline in the Company\u2019s total market capitalization has caused it to be out of compliance with an additional continued listing standard. Rule 802.01B of the NYSE LCM requires that a company maintain an average market capitalization of at least $50 million over a period of 30 consecutive trading days, unless at the same time the company\u2019s total stockholders\u2019 equity is equal to or greater than $50 million. In accordance with applicable NYSE procedures pertaining to non-compliance due to low market capitalization, the Company had until February 19, 2019 to submit a plan to meet the minimum market capitalization requirement within 18 months and restore its compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards.\nThe Company thereafter did not submit a plan of compliance within the required timeframe that, if accepted by the NYSE, would have allowed our common stock to remain on the NYSE for a period of 18 months in order for us to bring the Company into conformity with the Rule 802.01B market capitalization standard (subject to compliance with the NYSE\u2019s other continued listing standards and continued NYSE review of our progress). On February 20, 2019, the Company received a written notice from the NYSE that, based on the foregoing, our common stock was subject to delisting proceedings. Although the NYSE LCM provides the Company limited rights to seek a review of the NYSE\u2019s determination, the Company has elected not to seek any such review or otherwise appeal the NYSE\u2019s determination. Trading in the Company\u2019s common stock was suspended at the market opening on February 20, 2019. At this time, the Company expects that the NYSE could file a Form 25 to delist the Common Stock as early as March 7, 2019, following\nthe conclusion of the 10 business day review and appeal period. Under Rule 12d2-2(d)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), an application on Form 25 to strike a class of securities from listing on a national securities exchange will be effective 10 days after the filing of the Form 25.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink market (OTC Pink: SNEC), although there is no assurance that an active market in the common stock will develop. Securities quoted in the over-the-counter markets are not considered to be traded on a national exchange. Even if the common stock remains quoted on the OTC Pink, the delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could negatively impact the Company, as it will likely reduce the liquidity and market price of the common stock; reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire the common stock; negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to access equity markets and obtain financing; and impair the Company\u2019s ability to provide equity incentives.\nOur stock price has declined significantly, and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses if our stock price remains depressed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our stock price declined from a high closing price of $5.99 per share on January 12, 2018 to a low closing price of $0.25 per share on December 27, 2018. As a result of this extended decline, investors may not be able to recover their investment in us. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe price of oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nthe success of our exploration and development operations, and the marketing of any hydrocarbons we produce;\n\u00b7\nour ability to access equity financing while quoted in over-the-counter securities markets rather than listed on a national stock exchange;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments in the United States;\n\u00b7\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nquarterly or annual variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the industries in which we compete and issuance of new or modified securities;\n\u00b7\nanalyst reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u00b7\nhigher than achievable estimates by analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u00b7\nour issuance of any additional securities;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perception of the Company and of the industry in which we compete;\n\u00b7\nour ability or inability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nfiling for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nIn addition, if we undertake one or more strategic or financing transactions it would likely be highly dilutive to holders of our common stock or preferred stock or possibly cause the loss of all or substantially all of their respective investments. See \u201c-We are evaluating a variety of strategic alternatives to improve our balance sheet and to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments; however, there is no guarantee that any such alternatives can be effectuated on acceptable terms or at all, such alternatives could adversely affect our creditors and put our stockholders at significant risk of losing all of their respective investments in us.\u201d\nOur lack of diversification increases the risk of an investment in us and we are vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major contiguous area.\nOur current business focus is on the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in a limited number of properties, in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and, to a lesser extent, the TMS in Southwest Mississippi and Southeast Louisiana. Larger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversification. However, we currently lack diversification, in terms of both the nature and geographic scope of our business. For example, our Catarina assets, comprising approximately 106,000 contiguous net acres in Dimmit, La Salle and Webb counties, Texas under the Catarina Lease, represent approximately 58% of our proved reserves, approximately 39% of our Eagle Ford acreage and approximately 52% of our total production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely by factors affecting our industry or the regions in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified, increasing our risk profile. In particular, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from wells in which we have an interest that are caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from wells in the Eagle Ford Shale. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisition, development and production operations require us to make substantial capital expenditures. Although we expect to fund our capital expenditure budget for 2019 using cash flow from operations and cash on hand, if our cash flow from operations turns out to be less than we currently expect and we are required, but are unable, to fund our remaining capital budget from other sources, such as borrowings under the credit agreements and/or the issuance of debt or equity securities, our failure to obtain the funds that we need could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry in which we operate is capital intensive and we must make substantial expenditures in our business for the acquisition, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs. During 2018 we invested approximately $593 million for drilling and completion activities in our core areas. For 2019, we have set a capital budget of approximately $100 million to $150 million, which we anticipate funding primarily with cash on hand and cash flow from operations. We expect our planned reductions in development activity in 2019 to cause our production to decline, which will begin to reduce our revenue, cash flows and possibly our reserves (particularly if commodity prices remain low and, as a result of low commodity prices or other circumstances we did not anticipate or which are beyond our control, our capital expenditures budget does not return in 2020 to amounts comparable to our historic (pre-2019) levels).\nOur cash on hand, cash flows from operations, ability to borrow and access to capital markets are subject to a number of variables, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nour estimated reserves of proved oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully execute on our drilling and development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce;\n\u00b7\nthe prices at which we sell our production;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our hedging strategy;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of developing, producing, and transporting our oil, natural gas and NGLs, including costs attributable to governmental regulation and taxation;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire, find and produce new reserves;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in our working capital needs;\n\u00b7\ninterest payments, debt service and dividend payment requirements;\n\u00b7\nour ability to comply with the financial covenants in our debt instruments, to repay our debt, and to address our near-term liquidity needs, particularly if oil and natural gas prices remain volatile and/or depressed;\n\u00b7\nprevailing economic and capital markets conditions, especially for oil and natural gas companies;\n\u00b7\nour financial condition; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability and willingness of banks and other institutions to lend to us.\nIn addition, we may be unable to access the capital markets for debt or equity financing. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining the funds we need to execute our capital budget, we will be forced to further reduce our capital expenditures, which in turn could lead to additional declines in our production, revenues, cash flows and our reserves, and could further adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, our ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement or UnSub Credit Agreements is or may be limited or such borrowings may be unavailable to fund our capital expenditures. For example, as of February 26, 2019, we had approximately $17.1 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement and no borrowings, resulting in less than $8 million in availability for borrowings or additional letters of credit. Failure to comply with certain operational covenants under the Credit Agreement or UnSub Credit Agreement could result in events of default in the future that would restrict our access to capital and/or accelerate our payment obligations. In addition, in December 2018, the borrowing base under the UnSub Credit Agreement was reduced from $380 million to $315 million and may be further reduced in the future.\nA portion of our oil and natural gas production is subject to commodity derivative contracts and the price we receive for such production is dependent on conditions in the market at the time we enter into such contracts.\nOn a consolidated basis, the Company has hedged approximately 3,149,000 Bbls of its 2019 oil production and 17,644,000 MMBtu of its 2019 natural gas production. SN UnSub\u2019s production represents approximately 54% of the hedged oil volumes and approximately 59% of the hedged gas volumes. In the future, we expect to continue to enter into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our estimated production, which could result in net gains or losses on commodity derivatives. Our hedging strategy and future hedging transactions will be determined by our management in accordance with the terms of SN UnSub\u2019s organizational documents and any restrictions or limitations in our debt instruments.\nThe prices at which we enter into commodity derivative contracts covering our production in the future will be dependent upon conditions in the commodity and financial markets at the time we enter into these transactions, which may result in higher or lower hedge prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs under these contracts. Accordingly, our hedging strategy may not protect us from significant or prolonged declines in the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs for future production. Conversely, our hedging strategy may limit our ability to realize incremental cash flows from commodity price increases. As such, our hedging strategy may not protect us from changes in the price of oil, natural gas and NGLs, which could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage or the leases are extended.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production in paying quantities is established during their primary terms or we obtain extensions of the leases. Our drilling plans for our undeveloped leasehold acreage are subject to change based upon various factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as drilling results, prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if our undeveloped leasehold acreage will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations. If our leases expire and we do not have them held by production, we will lose our right to develop the related properties on this acreage.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 77% of our net acreage was held by production and/or continuous operations. We also have leases that were not held by production and/or continuous operations representing approximately 66,000 net acres (of which approximately 54,000 net acres were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2019, approximately 6,000 net acres (all of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2020, and approximately 4,000 net acres (all of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2021 and beyond. Of the 54,000 net Eagle Ford acres set to expire in 2019, approximately 45,000 net acres are subject to two-year extension options, or drilling commitments, which would permit us to extend the primary term of those leases into 2021. In addition, we have a continuous drilling commitment in our Catarina area that requires us to drill, but not complete, (i) 50 wells in each annual period commencing on July 1, 2014 and (ii) at least one well in any consecutive 120-day period, in order to maintain rights to any future undeveloped acreage. We also have a continuous development commitment in our Comanche area that, among other requirements, must be met in order to maintain our acreage position requiring us to complete and equip 60 wells in each of five consecutive annual periods beginning September 1, 2017 or pay a penalty for the failure to do so. While we anticipate that our current and future drilling plans along with selected lease extensions will address the majority of our leases expiring in the Eagle Ford Shale in 2019, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future drilling activities on our existing acreage. Developing these identified drilling locations represents a significant part of our long term business strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, costs and drilling results. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations could be disrupted if our or SOG\u2019s information systems are hacked or fail, causing increased expenses and loss of revenue.\nWe face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data systems unusable, and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, SNMP facilities or infrastructure or other third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as pipelines. The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is highly dependent on financial, accounting and other data processing systems and other communications and information systems, including such systems of SOG that we utilize pursuant to the Services Agreement with SOG. We process transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer\nsystems. If a key system were hacked or otherwise interfered with by unauthorized access, or were to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason, even if only for a short period, our financial results could be affected adversely.\nAdditionally, we rely on information systems across our operations, including for the management of processes and transactions. A disruption to any information systems at our operating locations, or at SNMP\u2019s or a third-party\u2019s pipelines, terminals, operating locations or other facilities may cause disruptions to our operations. These systems could be damaged or interrupted by a security breach, cyber-attack, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure or similar event. Further, our business interruption insurance may not compensate us adequately for losses that may occur. Additionally, federal legislation relating to cybersecurity threats could impose additional requirements on our operations. Finally, our implementation of additional procedures and controls in response to such legislation or to otherwise monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively with other companies in our industry, which may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive with respect to acquiring prospects and properties, the marketing of oil, natural gas and NGLs, and attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those entities may be able to develop and acquire more properties than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to identify and evaluate suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, the capital markets have become more constrained for the oil and natural gas industry, which has led to substantial competition for funding and other financial resources to pursue acquisitions and general business opportunities. Many of our larger competitors not only drill for and produce oil and natural gas but also conduct refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial, technical or personnel resources permit. In addition, there is substantial competition for investment capital in the oil and natural gas industry. These larger companies may have a greater ability to continue development activities during periods of lower prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations. Furthermore, we may not be able to aggregate sufficient quantities of production to compete with larger companies that are able to sell greater volumes of production to intermediaries, thereby reducing the realized prices attributable to our production. Any inability to compete effectively with larger companies could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn increase in the differential between the NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs and the wellhead price we receive for our production could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe prices that we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that we produce at times may reflect differences between the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX, that are used for calculating hedge positions. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a basis differential. Increases in the basis differential between the benchmark prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and the wellhead price we receive could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not have or currently plan to have any commodity derivative contracts covering the amount of the basis differentials we experience in respect of our production. As such, we will be exposed to any increase in such differentials, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured.\nThere are a variety of operating risks inherent in our wells and other operating properties and facilities, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems and natural disasters, all of which could cause substantial financial losses. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of our operations, substantial repair costs, personal\ninjury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial revenue losses. The location of our wells and other operating properties and facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.\nInsurance against all operational risks is not available to us. We are not fully insured against all risks, including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. Losses could, therefore, occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Moreover, insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms. Changes in the insurance markets due to weather, adverse economic conditions, and the aftermath of the Macondo well incident in the Gulf of Mexico have made it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would otherwise have obtained prior to these market changes, and we cannot be sure the insurance coverage we do obtain will not contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and are unable to control their proper operation and profitability.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we own an ownership interest. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operations of these non-operated properties. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production, revenues and reserves. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe nature and timing of the operator\u2019s drilling and other activities;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of required capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe operator\u2019s geological and engineering expertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7\nthe approval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u00b7\nthe operator\u2019s selection of suitable technology.\nOur ability to produce oil and natural gas could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling and completion operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules.\nWater is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Drought conditions have persisted in our areas of operation in past years. These drought conditions have led governmental authorities to restrict the use of water, subject to their jurisdiction, for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations, we may be unable to economically produce oil and natural gas, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, the Clean Water Act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste into navigable waters. In addition, the underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. Public concerns regarding the potential impacts to groundwater and induced seismic activity have resulted in new requirements related to the underground injection and disposal of fluids. The EPA is also examining regulatory requirements for \u201cindirect dischargers\u201d of wastewater - i.e., those that send their discharges to private or publicly owned treatment facilities, which treat the wastewater before discharging it to regulated waters. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the discharge of underground injection of fluids and the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted.\nWe may lose our rights to the Sanchez Group\u2019s technological database, including its 3D and 2D seismic data, under certain circumstances.\nPursuant to the Services Agreement, we have been granted access to the technological database owned and maintained by the Sanchez Group, and SOG interprets and uses the database for our benefit under the Services Agreement. For a description of the Services Agreement see \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -Note 10, Related Party Transactions\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This database includes the 2D and 3D seismic data used for our exploration and development projects as well as the well logs, LAS files, scanned well documents and other well documents and software that are necessary for our daily activities. This information is critical for the operation and expansion of our business. Under certain circumstances, including if SOG provides at least 180 days\u2019 advance written notice of its desire to terminate the Services Agreement, the license agreement will terminate and we will lose our rights to this technological database unless members of the Sanchez Group permit us to retain some or all of these rights, which they may decline to do in their sole discretion. In such event, we are unlikely to be able to obtain rights to similar information under substantially similar commercial terms or to continue our business operations as proposed and our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and it could delay or prevent an acquisition of us.\nIf we do not purchase additional acreage or make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited.\nOur ability to grow depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. We may be unable to make such acquisitions because we are:\n\u00b7\nunable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with their owners;\n\u00b7\nunable to obtain financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; or\n\u00b7\noutbid by competitors.\nIf we are unable to acquire properties containing proved reserves, our total level of estimated proved reserves will decline as a result of our production.\nAny acquisitions we complete or geographic expansions we undertake will be subject to substantial risks that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u00b7\nmistaken assumptions about estimated proved reserves, future production, revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs, including synergies, timing of expected development and the potential for expiration of underlying leaseholds;\n\u00b7\nan inability to successfully integrate the assets or businesses we acquire;\n\u00b7\na decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7\na significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which any indemnity we receive is inadequate;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nmistaken assumptions about the overall cost of equity or debt;\n\u00b7\nan inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets;\n\u00b7\nfacts and circumstances that could give rise to significant cash and certain non-cash charges; and\n\u00b7\ncustomer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nFurther, we may in the future expand our operations into new geographic areas with operating conditions and a regulatory environment that may not be as familiar to us as our existing core areas. As a result, we may encounter obstacles that may cause us not to achieve the expected results of any such acquisitions, and any adverse conditions, regulations or developments related to any assets acquired in new geographic areas may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic data and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. Our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to perform an in-depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition, given time constraints imposed by sellers. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.\nWe have extended the term of our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) Rights Plan, which may discourage the acquisition and sale of large blocks of our common stock and may result in significant dilution for certain stockholders.\nOn July 27, 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the NOL Rights Plan (as amended, the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) designed to preserve stockholder value and the value of our NOLs by acting as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock without the approval of our board of directors. The extension of the Rights Plan may depress the market price of our common stock, as it may reduce the liquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock by discouraging existing 5% common stockholders from selling their interests in a single block and may deter institutional investors from investing in our common stock or potential acquirers from making premium offers to acquire the Company. We can make no assurances the Rights Plan will be effective in meeting its intended objectives, including to deter a change in control and protecting or realizing NOLs.\nIf we were to experience an ownership change, we could be limited in our ability to use NOLs arising prior to the ownership change to offset future taxable income. In addition, our ability to use NOLs to reduce future tax payments may be limited if our taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had NOLs of $2,028.8 million. If we were to experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with NOLs arising prior to the ownership change would be limited, possibly substantially. An ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our pre-change NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax-exempt rate. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) at any time during a rolling three-year period. Future changes in the ownership of our stock, including changes as a result of any restructuring or recapitalization transactions (pursuant to the U.S Bankruptcy Code or otherwise), may trigger an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nIn addition, as a result of the Tax Act, NOLs arising before January 1, 2018, and NOLs arising on or after January 1, 2018, are subject to different rules. NOLs arising before January 1, 2018 can generally be carried forward to offset future taxable income for a period of 20 years. Any NOLs arising on or after January 1, 2018, while subject to additional limitations, can generally be carried forward indefinitely. Our ability to use our NOLs during this period will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income, and the NOLs could expire before we generate sufficient taxable income to make use of our NOLs.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness and recent borrowing base decrease, we may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness and a recent borrowing base decrease under the SN UnSub Credit Agreement, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including under the SN UnSub Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.4 billion of debt outstanding, net of premium, discount and debt issuance costs, the majority of which was attributable to the Senior Notes (as defined in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6, Debt\u201d), a $25 million commitment to provide primarily for working capital and letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, and a borrowing base of $315 million under the SN UnSub Credit Agreement, of which $167.5 million in borrowings was drawn at year end.\nOur increased indebtedness could adversely affect our business. In particular, the incurrence of additional debt could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, expose us to additional debt service, covenant compliance and other obligations, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the SN UnSub Credit Agreement and the SR Credit Agreement, all of which bear interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes could affect the amount of our interest payments under these credit facilities and, accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. We currently do not have any interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to our credit facilities. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps in order to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility; however, any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. A significant increase in prevailing interest rates that results in a substantial increase in the interest rates applicable to our indebtedness could substantially increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictive covenants may adversely affect our operations.\nThe Credit Agreement, the indentures governing the Senior Notes (as defined in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6. Debt), the SN UnSub Credit Agreement and the SR Credit Agreement contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long term best interest, including our ability, among other things, to:\n\u00b7\nincur or assume additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u00b7\nissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u00b7\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u00b7\nmake loans and investments;\n\u00b7\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u00b7\nrestrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nsell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate or merge with or into another entity, or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7\nenter into new lines of business.\nAdditionally, if dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock are in arrears and unpaid for six or more quarterly periods, the holders (voting as a single class) of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect two additional directors to our board of directors until paid in full. Furthermore, unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends are declared and paid on the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, no dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in shares of parity stock or junior stock, under certain circumstances, and cash in lieu of fractional shares) may be declared, made or paid, or set apart for payment upon, any parity stock or junior stock (including our common stock), nor may any parity stock or junior stock (including our common stock) be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration by us or on our behalf, except in limited circumstances. Covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, future credit facilities we may enter into, our indentures and the certificates of designations for our preferred stock restrict our ability to pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) permits payment of dividends only out of a corporation\u2019s surplus, which is defined as the excess of net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over a corporation\u2019s capital as determined under the DGCL. If commodity prices remain at the depressed levels to which they declined during the fourth quarter of 2018, the value of our net assets will consequently remain depressed and our ability to lawfully declare and pay dividends will decline.\nA breach of the covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Notes, the covenants under the Credit Agreement or the covenants under the SN UnSub Credit Agreement and SR Credit Agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. An event of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in an acceleration of any other debt that contains a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision (however, a default under the Credit Agreement or the Senior Notes would not result in a default under or the acceleration of the SN UnSub Credit Agreement or SR Credit Agreement and a default under the SN UnSub Credit Agreement or SR Credit Agreement would not result in a default under or the acceleration of the Credit Agreement or Senior Notes). Moreover, an event of default may, under certain circumstances, allow counterparties to our hedge agreements to terminate the hedge transactions to which they are a party, which termination could occur at an unfavorable time and result in cash settlement payments, losses or reductions in income. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement or the\nSN UnSub Credit Agreement would permit the lenders under the relevant facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. If we were unable to repay those amounts or amounts due to holders of our 7.25% Senior Secured Notes or the lender under the SR Credit Agreement, the lenders under the Credit Agreement, the SN UnSub Credit Agreement or the SR Credit Agreement or the holders of our 7.25% Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt. See \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10, Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock and have suspended our preferred stock dividend payments, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our board of directors recently determined to suspend the dividend on our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, beginning with the three-month period ending March 31, 2019. We currently intend to retain all future earnings otherwise payable as common and, potentially, preferred dividends to fund our development and other business activities. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors may deem relevant. Covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, future credit facilities we may enter into, our indentures and the certificates of designations for our preferred stock restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and could in the future restrict our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock. In addition, the DGCL permits payment of dividends only out of a corporation\u2019s surplus, which is defined as the excess of net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over a corporation\u2019s capital as determined under the DGCL. If commodity prices remain at the depressed levels to which they declined during the fourth quarter of 2018, the value of our net assets will consequently remain depressed and our ability to lawfully declare and pay dividends will decline. Therefore, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock or preferred stock.\nInvestors in our common stock and Preferred Stock must rely on sales of their common stock and Preferred Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. However, our common stock price experienced a decline from a high closing price of $5.99 per share on January 12, 2018 to a low closing price of $0.25 per share on December 27, 2018, ending the year at $0.27 per share on December 31, 2018, and trading in our common stock has been suspended on the NYSE and our common stock is subject to NYSE delisting proceedings. See \u201c-Trading in our common stock on the NYSE was suspended on February 20, 2019, and the NYSE has notified us that our common stock is subject to delisting proceedings. At this time, we expect that the NYSE could file a Form 25 to delist our common stock as early as March 7, 2019. Our common stock is quoted only in the over-the-counter market, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity.\u201d Although the Preferred Stock has a $50.00 per share liquidation preference, it is unlikely the Preferred Stock (or our common stock) would receive any distributions upon our dissolution or liquidation. Consequently, our investors\u2019 abilities to realize returns in their respective investments will be significantly constrained.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common process used by oil and natural gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and natural gas wells whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from federal regulation, and thus the process is typically regulated by state agencies. Nevertheless, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the Underground Injection Control or UIC Program. In Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider EPA guidance in these areas.\nOn May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment, processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, President Trump directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and\nsafe development of the nation\u2019s energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. On June 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations, including fugitive emission requirements. Also, on October 15, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule to significantly reduce regulatory burdens imposed by the 2016 regulations, including, for example, reducing the monitoring frequency for fugitive emissions and revising the requirements for pneumatic pumps at well sites. The above standards, to the extent implemented, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions.\nFurthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of produced water and flowback fluid in underground injection wells. Also, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, and a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have induced seismic activity and adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally. These proceedings or regulations or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of produced water and flowback fluid in underground injection wells could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from conventional or tight formations, increase our costs of compliance and doing business and make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings.\nFurther federal, state and/or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and potential increases in costs. Such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if additional federal, state and/or local laws are enacted. Please read \u201cItem 1. Business - Environmental Matters and Regulation\u201d for a description of the laws and regulations governing hydraulic fracturing.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities, as well as our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nState and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities, particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and natural gas activity and induced seismicity. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements, including requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, on October 28, 2014, the Commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water or other oil and natural gas waste to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the agency may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. The Commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells.\nWe dispose of large volumes of produced water gathered from our drilling and production operations by injecting it into wells pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements, owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities. The adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of produced water gathered from our drilling and production activities by owned disposal wells, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations. In addition, the third parties on whom we rely for gathering and transportation services are also subject to complex federal, state and other laws that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our business.\nOur oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation\u201d for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nIn addition, the operations of the third parties on whom we rely for gathering and transportation services are also subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations that require obtaining and maintaining numerous permits, approvals and certifications from various federal, state and local government authorities. These third parties may incur substantial costs in order to comply with existing laws and regulations. If existing laws and regulations governing such third-party services are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to their operations, these changes may affect the costs that we pay for such services. Similarly, a failure to comply with such laws and regulations by the third parties on whom we rely could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation\u201d for a description of the laws and regulations that affect the third parties on whom we rely.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nIn recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of GHGs. The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emission control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions. Almost one-half of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs.\nFurthermore, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake \u201cambitious efforts\u201d to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016 and establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and begin negotiations to either re-enter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the United States. The Paris Agreement sets forth a specific exit process, whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date, with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice. It is not clear what steps the Trump Administration plans to take to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, whether a new agreement can be negotiated, or what terms would be included in such an agreement. Furthermore, in response to the announcement, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord.\nRestrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to monitor and report GHG emissions, purchase and operate emissions control systems to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thus could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nIn addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nMoreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and operational safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nWe may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of stringent and complex environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our oil and natural gas development and production operations. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including that they may (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities; (iii) govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; (iv) limit or prohibit drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, seismically active areas, and other protected areas; (v) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; (vi) result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations; (vii) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations; and (viii) require that additional pollution controls be installed. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly compliance or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and, in some instances, the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste control, handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Please read \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation\u201d for more information.\nDerivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe July 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, the SEC and certain federal regulators of financial institutions, or Prudential Regulators, adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities.\nAlthough some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act remain to be adopted, the CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued many rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including (i) a rule, which we refer to as the \u201cMandatory Clearing Rule,\u201d requiring clearing of hedges, or swaps, that are subject to it (currently, only certain interest rate and credit default swaps, which we do not presently have), a rule, which we refer to as the \u201cEnd User Exception,\u201d establishing an \u201cend user\u201d exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule, a rule, which we refer to as the \u201cMargin Rule,\u201d setting forth collateral requirements in connection with swaps that are not cleared and also an exception to the Margin Rule for end users that are not financial end users, which exception we refer to as the \u201cNon-Financial End User Exception;\u201d (ii) rules, which we refer to as \u201cStay Rules,\u201d imposing limits on default rights on counterparties under swaps with financial institutions that are regulated by certain of the Prudential Regulators; and (iii) a rule, subsequently vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and remanded to the CFTC for further proceedings, imposing position limits on energy derivatives. On multiple occasions, most recently in December 2016, the CFTC proposed but did not adopt other position limit rules on energy derivatives. Such proposed rules have included exemptions from the position limits for swaps that constitute \u201cbona fide hedging positions\u201d within the definition of such term under such proposed rules, subject to the party claiming the exemption complying with the applicable filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of such proposed rules. It is not known whether the CFTC will adopt a rule which we refer to as a \u201cPosition Limit Rule\u201d imposing position limits on energy derivatives or, if such a rule is adopted, whether such rule will include an exemption for \u201cbona fide hedging positions.\u201d Nor is it known if our hedging activities will constitute \u201cbona fide hedging positions\u201d under any such Position Limit Rule. In addition, in October of 2018, certain of the Prudential Regulators proposed rules, which we refer to as \u201cStandardized Approach Rules,\u201d which would require financial institutions regulated by such Prudential Regulators to change how they calculate exposure to swaps for purposes of determining capital requirements applicable to such financial institutions. It is not known whether such Prudential Regulators will adopt the Standardized Approach Rules, nor is it known how the adoption of such rules would affect the capital requirements applicable to our swap counterparties.\nWe qualify for the End User Exception and will utilize it if the Mandatory Clearing Rule is expanded to cover swaps in which we participate and we qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception and will not be required to post margin under the Margin Rule, so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules. However, most if not all of our hedge counterparties are subject to mandatory clearing of swaps of covered types (currently only certain interest rate and credit default swaps) in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the End User Exception and, depending on the scope of the their swap activities (combined with the swap activities of their affiliates) and the swap activities of their counterparties (combined with the swap activities of their affiliates) either already are or will be required to post margin in connection with their hedging activities with other swap dealers, major swap participants, financial end users and other persons that do not qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception. The Stay Rules restricting our exercise of default rights related, directly or indirectly, to affiliates of our swap counterparties that are subject to regulation by certain of the Prudential Regulators entering into insolvency proceedings, will not become applicable to us until January 1, 2020. However, most if not all of our hedge counterparties became subject to such rules on January 1, 2019. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations (including laws and regulations giving European Union financial authorities the power to write down amounts we may be owed on hedging agreements with counterparties subject to such laws and regulations and/or require that we accept equity interests in such counterparties in lieu of cash in satisfaction of such amounts), which we refer to collectively as \u201cForeign Regulations\u201d which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act, the rules which have been adopted and not vacated, and, to the extent that a Position Limit Rule and the Standardized Approach Rules are ultimately effected, such rules could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. The Foreign Regulations could have similar effects. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations and Foreign Regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nTax laws and regulations may change over time, including the elimination of federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development.\nTax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation, and the tax laws and regulations to which we are subject may change over time. Our tax filings are based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various jurisdictions at the time that the filings were made. If these laws or regulations change, or if the taxing authorities do not agree with our interpretation of the effects of such laws and regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) that significantly reforms the Code. The Tax Act, among other things, (i) permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate; (ii) repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax; (iii) eliminates the deduction for certain domestic production activities; (iv) imposes new limitations on the utilization of NOLs, and (v) provides for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, which may impact the taxation of oil and natural gas companies. The Tax Act is complex and far-reaching and due to additional guidance that continues to be issued, we cannot predict with certainty the resulting impact its enactment will have on us. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and any such changes in our interpretations or assumptions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn past years, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current expensing of intangible drilling and development costs; and (iii) an extension of\nthe amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. While these specific changes are not included in the Tax Act, no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. The elimination of such U.S. federal tax deductions, as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxes (including the imposition of, or increases in production, severance or similar taxes) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing the after-tax costs we incur which would in turn make it uneconomic to drill some locations if commodity prices are not sufficiently high, resulting in lower revenues and decreases in production and reserves.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our Rights Plan and Delaware law that could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us. These provisions may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team. Furthermore, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits, with some exceptions, stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us.\nIn addition, the Company entered into the Rights Plan on July 28, 2015, and on July 27, 2018, the Company extended the term of the Rights Plan to July 26, 2021. Although not intended for this purpose, the Rights Plan has an anti-takeover effect. The Rights Plan is designed to preserve stockholder value and the value of our NOLs by acting as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock without the approval of our board of directors. For more information on possible risks associated with our rights plan, please see \u201c-We have extended the term of our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) Rights Plan, which may discourage the acquisition and sale of large blocks of our common stock and may result in significant dilution for certain stockholders.\u201d\nFinally, our amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. Although we believe these provisions together provide an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer to acquire us may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks.\nWe, including our officers and directors, are involved in various legal proceedings from time to time. Certain of these legal proceedings may be a significant distraction to management and could expose the Company to significant liability, including damages, fines, penalties and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nInformation regarding recent material litigation is discussed in more detail below in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nWe may have potential business conflicts of interest with members of the Sanchez Group regarding our past, ongoing and future relationships and the resolution of these conflicts may not be favorable to us.\nConflicts of interest may arise between members of the Sanchez Group and us in a number of areas relating to our past, ongoing and future relationships, including:\n\u00b7\nlabor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising under agreements with SOG;\n\u00b7\nemployee recruiting and retention, particularly if we engage in restructuring or recapitalization transactions;\n\u00b7\nbusiness opportunities that may be attractive to both members of the Sanchez Group and us; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness transactions that we enter into with members of the Sanchez Group.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nFinally, in connection with our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d), we entered into several agreements with members of the Sanchez Group. In addition, at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, we entered into management services agreements with SOG for it to perform various management service functions for SN UnSub and Blackstone and/or their affiliates. These agreements were made in the context of a related party transaction. The terms of these agreements may be more or less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties.\nPursuant to the terms of our restated certificate of incorporation, members of the Sanchez Group are not required to offer corporate opportunities to us, and our directors and officers may be permitted to offer certain corporate opportunities to members of the Sanchez Group before us.\nOur board of directors includes persons who are also directors and/or officers of members of the Sanchez Group. Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that:\n\u00b7\nmembers of the Sanchez Group are free to compete with us in any activity or line of business;\n\u00b7\nwe do not have any interest or expectancy in any business opportunity, transaction or other matter in which members of the Sanchez Group engage or seek to engage merely because we engage in the same or similar lines of business;\n\u00b7\nto the fullest extent permitted by law, members of the Sanchez Group will have no duty to communicate their knowledge of, or offer, any potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter to us, and members of the Sanchez Group are free to pursue or acquire such business opportunity, transaction or other matter for themselves or direct the business opportunity, transaction or other matter to its affiliates; and\n\u00b7\nif any director or officer of any member of the Sanchez Group who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that business opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that business opportunity to such member of the Sanchez Group and that director or officer will not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be deemed to have (1) breached or acted in a manner inconsistent with or opposed to his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the business opportunity or (2) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our best interests or those of our stockholders.\nWe depend on SOG to provide us with certain services for our business. The services that SOG provides to us may not be sufficient to meet our needs, and we may have difficulty finding replacement services or be required to pay increased costs to replace these services after our agreements with SOG expire.\nCertain services required by us for the operation of our business, including general and administrative services, geological, geophysical and reserve engineering, lease and land administration, marketing, financial and accounting, operational services, information technology services, compliance, insurance maintenance and management of outside professionals, are provided by SOG pursuant to the Services Agreement. The services provided under the Services Agreement commenced on the date that the IPO closed and had an initial term of five years. The term automatically extends for additional 12-month periods and is terminable by either party at any time upon 180 days\u2019 written notice. See \u201cCorporate Governance-Compensation Committee\u201d in the proxy statement for the 2018 annual meeting of\nstockholders. While these services are being provided to us by SOG, our operational flexibility to modify or implement changes with respect to such services or the amounts we pay for them is limited. After the expiration or termination of this agreement, we may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate third-party agreements on terms and conditions, including cost, comparable to those that we will receive from SOG under our agreements with SOG. Furthermore, during the term of the Services Agreement, we or SOG may not be able to retain, attract or replace key SOG personnel, particularly if we engage in restructuring or recapitalization transactions.\nIn addition, SOG may outsource some or all of these services to third parties, and a failure of all or part of SOG\u2019s relationships with its outsourcing providers could lead to delays in or interruptions of these services. Our reliance on SOG and others as service providers and on SOG\u2019s outsourcing relationships, and our limited ability to control certain costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSector cost inflation could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nOur industry is cyclical and third-party oilfield materials, service and supply costs are also subject to supply and demand dynamics. During periods of decreasing levels of industry exploration and production, such as occurred in 2015 and 2016 and in the fourth quarter of 2018, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services decreases. Conversely, during periods of increasing levels of industry activity, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services increases.\nIn the event of robust commodity price recovery, we expect industry exploration and production activities to increase, resulting in higher demand for oilfield services and supplies and concurrent sector price inflation. In addition, the costs of such items could increase and their availability may become limited, particularly in basins of relatively higher activity.\nA portion of our total outstanding shares is held by members of the Sanchez Group and may be sold into the market at any time. In addition, Blackstone and GSO (or their affiliates) received a substantial number of our securities in connection with the Comanche Acquisition which they may also sell into the market at their discretion, subject to certain limitations. Such sale transactions could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nAs of February 26, 2019, members of the Sanchez Group owned, in the aggregate, approximately 12.8% of our outstanding common stock. These shares are generally eligible for resale in the public markets, subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, if then applicable. In addition, at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, we issued approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock to GSO and warrants to purchase approximately 1.9 million and 6.5 million shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $10.00 per share, to GSO and three affiliates of Blackstone, respectively, resulting in GSO and such Blackstone affiliates owning approximately 4.1% and 6.8% of our common stock, respectively, assuming that the warrants were fully exercised as of February 26, 2019. Following the conclusion of a two-year lockup period which ended on March 1, 2019, shares of common stock issued pursuant to these warrants are eligible for resale in the public markets, subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, if then applicable. In addition, under certain circumstances, members of the Sanchez Group, GSO and such Blackstone affiliates have the right to require us to register the resale of their shares. Moreover, we have registered all of the shares of our common stock that we may issue under our equity incentive plans and there were an additional 6,103,130 shares available for future issuance to our directors, officers and employees and consultants of the Sanchez Group as restricted stock or stock option awards pursuant to our Third Amended and Restated 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan (the \u201cLTIP\u201d) as of December 31, 2018. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance unless, pursuant to their terms, these stock awards have transfer restrictions attached to them or are held by our affiliates, in which event such shares may be sold subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, if then applicable. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13139, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SNECQ"}
