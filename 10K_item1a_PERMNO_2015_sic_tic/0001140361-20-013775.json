{"cik": "795212", "company": "TRANS WORLD ENTERTAINMENT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-06-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following is a discussion of certain factors, which could affect the financial results of the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we cannot successfully implement our business strategy our growth and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nOur future results will depend, among other things, on our success in implementing our business strategy.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, based on recurring losses from operations, the expectation of continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future, and uncertainty with respect to any available future funding, the Company concluded that there was substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. As a response, the Company pursued several strategic initiatives towards its strategy of shifting its focus solely to the operation of etailz, improving profitability and meeting future liquidity needs and capital requirements. The following initiatives were completed during the first quarter of 2020:\n\u2022\nThe sale of the For Your Entertainment (fye) business;\n\u2022\nThe establishment of a new secured $25 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cNew Credit Facility\u201d) with Encina Business Credit, LLC (\u201cEncina\u201d);\n\u2022\nThe execution of a separate subordinated loan agreement for etailz, Inc. (the \u201cSubordinated Loan\u201d); and\n\u2022\nThe receipt by etailz, Inc. of loan proceeds pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Plan (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the ability of the Company to meet its liabilities and to continue as a going concern is dependent on improved profitability, the continued implementation of the strategic initiative to reposition etailz as a platform of software and services, the availability of future funding, implementation of one or more corporate initiatives to reduce costs at the parent company level (which could include a voluntary delisting from NASDAQ and deregistering of our Common Stock in order to substantially eliminate the costs associated with being a public company), satisfying all unassumed liabilities of the fye segment and other strategic alternatives, including selling all or part of the remaining business or assets of the Company, and overcoming the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in further implementing our business strategy or that the strategy, including the completed initiatives, will be successful in sustaining acceptable levels of sales growth and profitability. As a result, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, the proceeds from the PPP Loan are subject to audit and there is a risk of repayment.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, may materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted if a public health outbreak, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, interferes with our ability, or the ability of our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, resulting in an economic downturn that could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, our ability to fund through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and through other means at acceptable terms, if at all, may be disrupted, in the event our financing needs for the foreseeable future are not able to be met by our New Credit Facility, balances of cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.\nIn addition, the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and various governmental responses in the United States has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business operations, including our ability to carry on business development activities, restrictions in business-related travel, delays or disruptions in our on-going projects, and unavailability of the employees of the Company or third-parties with whom we conduct business, due to illness or quarantines, among others. Our business was negatively impacted by disruptions in our supply chain, which limited our ability to source merchandise, and limits on products fulfillment placed by Amazon. The extent to which COVID-19 could impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, and will depend on many factors, including the duration of the outbreak, the effect of travel restrictions and social distancing efforts in the United States and other countries, the scope and length of business closures or business disruptions, and the actions taken by governments to contain and treat the disease. As such, we cannot presently predict the scope and extent of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions. Possible effects may include, but are not limited to, disruption to our customers and revenue, absenteeism in our labor workforce, unavailability of products and supplies used in our operations, shutdowns that may be mandated or requested by governmental authorities, and a decline in the value of our assets, including various long-lived assets.\nContinued increases in Amazon Marketplace fulfillment and storage fees could have an adverse impact on our profit margin and results of operations.\netailz utilizes Amazon\u2019s Freight by Amazon (\u201cFBA\u201d) platform to store their products at the Amazon fulfillment center and to pack and distribute these products to customers. If Amazon continues to increase its FBA fees, our profit margin for the etailz segment could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business is influenced by general economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. General economic conditions impacting discretionary consumer spending include, among others, wages and employment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. A downturn in the economy affects retailers disproportionately, as consumers may prioritize reductions in discretionary spending, which could have a direct impact on purchases of our products and services and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, reduced consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on gross profit.\nDisruption of global capital and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and capital resources.\nDistress in the financial markets has in the past and can in the future result in extreme volatility in security prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability. There can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs.\nBecause of our floating rate credit facility, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\nOur financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as the New Credit Facility is subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. As we borrow against our credit facility, a significant increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent upon access to capital, including bank credit facilities and short-term vendor financing, for its liquidity needs.\nThe Company must have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund its working capital requirements and indebtedness. Based on its recurring losses from operations, expectation of continuing operating losses, and uncertainty with respect to any available future funding, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the availability of credit and the Company\u2019s credit rating, as well as the Company\u2019s reputation with potential lenders. These factors could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to fund its working capital requirements, costs of borrowing, and the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nHistorically, we have experienced declines and we may continue to experience fluctuation in our level of sales and results from operations.\nA variety of factors has historically affected, and will continue to affect, our sales results and profit margins. These factors include general economic conditions; competition; actions taken by our competitors; consumer trends and preferences; access to third party marketplaces; and new product introductions and changes in our product mix.\nThere is no assurance that we will achieve positive levels of sales and earnings growth, and any decline in our future growth or performance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe ability of the Company to satisfy its liabilities and to continue as a going concern will continue to be dependent on the implementation of several items, the success of which is not certain.\nThe Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and the Company\u2019s primary sources of liquidity are borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility, available cash and cash equivalents, all of which are limited. Therefore, the ability of the Company to meet its liabilities and to continue as a going concern is dependent on, among other things, improved profitability, the continued implementation of the strategic initiative to reposition etailz as a platform of software and services, the availability of future funding, implementation of one or more corporate initiatives to reduce costs at the parent company level (which could include a voluntary delisting from NASDAQ and deregistering of our Common Stock in order to substantially eliminate the costs associated with being a public company), satisfying all unassumed liabilities of the fye segment and other strategic alternatives, including selling all or part of the remaining business or assets of the Company, and overcoming the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in further implementing our business strategy or that the strategy, including the completed initiatives, will be successful in sustaining acceptable levels of sales growth and profitability. As a result, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA change in one or more of the Company\u2019s partners\u2019 policies or the Company\u2019s relationship with those partners could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on its partners to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. If a partner fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, the Company could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales.\nHistorically, the etailz segment has not experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory sources of supply and management believes that it will continue to have access to adequate sources of supply. No individual partner exceeded 10% of etailz purchases in fiscal 2019.\netailz revenue is dependent upon maintaining etailz\u2019s relationship with Amazon and failure to do so, or any restrictions on our ability to offer products on the Amazon Marketplace, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\netailz generates substantially all of its revenue through the Amazon Marketplace. Therefore, we depend in large part on our relationship with Amazon for the growth of the etailz segment. In particular, we depend on our ability to offer products on the Amazon Marketplace. We also depend on Amazon for the timely delivery of products to customers. Any adverse change in our relationship with Amazon, including restrictions on the ability to offer products or termination of the relationship, could adversely affect the continued growth of our etailz segment and our financial condition and results of operations.\nParties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.\nThe Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including partners, vendors, suppliers, service providers and lenders, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits, including with respect to merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Company\u2019s business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Economic, industry and market conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in increased risks to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. The Company is not currently able to accurately determine the extent and scope of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Company\u2019s existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nBreach of data security could harm our business and standing with our customers.\nThe protection of our partner, employee and business data is critical to us. Our business, like that of most companies, involves confidential information about our employees, our suppliers and our Company. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of all such data, including confidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means, including deceiving our employees or third-party service providers. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect. We have implemented and regularly review and update our control systems, processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of customer payment card or personal information or employee personal or confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could damage our reputation, expose us to risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, harm our business and have an adverse impact upon our net sales and profitability. As the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. Further, if we are unable to comply with the security standards established by banks and the credit card industry, we may be subject to fines, restrictions and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could adversely affect our retail operations.\nOur hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage, theft or intrusion that could harm our business.\nAny failure of our computer hardware or software systems that causes an interruption in our operations or a decrease in inventory tracking could result in reduced net sales and profitability. Additionally, if any data intrusion, security breach, misappropriation or theft were to occur, we could incur significant costs in responding to such event, including responding to any resulting claims, litigation or investigations, which could harm our operating results.\nOur inability or failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or any claimed infringement by us of third-party intellectual rights, could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nOur trademark, trade secrets and other intellectual property, including proprietary software, are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could cause a decline in our revenue. In addition, any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us could be time-consuming to address, result in costly litigation, cause product delays, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or result in our loss of ownership or use of the intellectual property.\nLoss of key personnel or the inability to attract, train and retain qualified employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company believes that its future prospects depend, to a significant extent, on the services of its executive officers. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified key personnel. The loss of the services of certain of the Company\u2019s executive officers and other key management personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn addition to our executive officers, the Company\u2019s business is dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified team members. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, health care costs and changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members, our operations and support functions could suffer. Those factors, together with increased wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Significant legislative changes that impact our relationship with our workforce (none of which is represented by unions) could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible legislative changes impacting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer\u2019s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining units are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, health care mandates, and changes in overtime regulations.\nOur policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ Capital Market, as well as applicable employment laws. Additional legal and regulatory requirements increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in damage to our reputation, financial condition and market price of our stock.\nWe may face difficulties in meeting our labor needs to effectively operate our business.\nWe are heavily dependent upon our labor workforce. Our compensation packages are designed to provide benefits commensurate with our level of expected service. However, we face the challenge of filling many positions at wage scales that are appropriate to the industry and competitive factors. We also face other risks in meeting our labor needs, including competition for qualified personnel, overall unemployment levels, and increased costs associated with complying with regulations relating to COVID-19. Changes in any of these factors, including a shortage of available workforce, could interfere with our ability to adequately service our customers and could result in increasing labor costs.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs, including costs related to an increase in minimum wage and health care.\nLabor is one of the primary components in the cost of operating our business. Increased labor costs, whether due to competition, unionization, increased minimum wage, state unemployment rates, health care, or other employee benefits costs may adversely impact our operating expenses. Additionally, there is no assurance that future health care legislation will not adversely impact our results or operations.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, partners, suppliers, competitors, stockholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. We may incur losses relating to these claims, and in addition, these proceedings could cause us to incur costs and may require us to devote resources to defend against these claims that could adversely affect our results of operations. For a description of current legal proceedings, see \u201cPart I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nAn impairment of the carrying value of fixed assets, intangible assets and goodwill has negatively affected and may in the future negatively affect our financial results.\nBecause we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have represented a substantial portion of our total assets.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, we assess our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nDuring fiscal 2019, as a result of triggering events, the Company performed impairment tests on the fixed assets and operating lease right-of-use assets of the fye segment and concluded that both were fully impaired. The Company recorded impairment losses of approximately $23.2 million for fixed assets and operating lease right-of-use assets of the fye segment.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company fully impaired its vendor relationships and the Company recognized an impairment loss of $0.8 million.\nIn the future, significant negative industry or general economic trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of our long-lived assets may result in additional impairments to our fixed assets and intangible assets. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of fixed assets or intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nThe effects of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, and public health issues may adversely affect our business.\nNatural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes may affect store and distribution center operations. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, and military action both in the United States and abroad can have a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to purchase merchandise from suppliers for sale to our customers. Public health issues, such as flu or other pandemics, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations and result in a significant part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. Additionally, public health issues may disrupt, or have an adverse effect on, our suppliers\u2019 operations, our operations, our customers, or customer demand. Our ability to mitigate the adverse effect of these events depends, in part, upon the effectiveness of our disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning. However, we cannot be certain that our plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an actual disaster. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any significant declines in public safety or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect customer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on customer purchases of our products.\nThe terms of our asset-based revolving credit agreement impose certain restrictions on us that may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Additionally, our business could suffer if our ability to acquire financing is reduced or eliminated.\nOn February 20, 2020, etailz entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) with Encina, as administrative agent, under which the lenders committed to provide up to $25 million in loans under a three-year, secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cNew Credit Facility\u201d).\nAmong other things, the Loan Agreement limits etailz\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, make restricted payments or specified payments and merge or acquire assets. The Loan Agreement also requires etailz to comply with a financial maintenance covenant.\nThe Loan Agreement contains customary events (including our Subordinated Debt) of default, including, but not limited to, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other obligations, customary ERISA defaults, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, judgment defaults, the invalidity of liens on collateral, change in control, cessation of business or the liquidation of material assets of the borrowers and guarantors under the New Credit Facility taken as a whole, the occurrence of an uninsured loss to a material portion of collateral and failure of the obligations under the New Credit Facility to constitute senior indebtedness under any applicable subordination or intercreditor agreements, including our Subordinated Debt.\nAs of February 1, 2020, the Company had borrowings of $13.1 million under its previous credit facility with Wells Fargo. On February 20, 2020, in conjunction with the FYE Transaction, the Company fully satisfied its obligations under the Credit Facility.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock.\nThe ownership of our Common Stock is extremely concentrated, and entities affiliated with members of our Board of Directors have significant influence and control over the outcome of any vote of the Company\u2019s Shareholders and may have competing interests.\nThe Robert J. Higgins TWMC Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) owns approximately 39.1 % of the outstanding Common Stock and Neil Subin owns approximately 16.5% of the outstanding Common Stock, and as a result can control the outcome of most actions requiring shareholder approval. In addition, entities affiliated with each of the Trust and Mr. Subin, as well as one of our directors, Mr. Simpson, and certain of his affiliated entities, entered into a voting agreement (as described in \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d) and agreed to how their respective shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock held by the parties (which total approximately 60% ) will be voted with respect to (i) amending the Articles of Incorporation of the Company to set the size of the Board of Directors of the Company at three directors, (ii) the designation, election, removal, and replacement of members of the Board and (iii) how shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock held by the parties to the voting agreement will be voted on a Sale of the Company (as defined in the voting agreement) with respect to which there is a shareholder vote or some other action to take place during the ninety (90) days immediately following the date of the voting agreement. Pursuant to the voting agreement, Messrs. Marcus and Simpson were appointed as directors of the Company, and Mr. Reickert, a trustee of the Trust, remained as a director of the Company. Mr. Subin was also granted board observer rights. Entities affiliated with the Trust and Messrs. Marcus and Simpson are also lenders under our subordinated loan and security agreement, have received warrants to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and received contingent value rights (\u201cCVRs\u201d) representing the contractual right to receive cash payments from the Company in an amount equal, in the aggregate, to 19.9% of the proceeds received by the Company in respect of certain intercompany indebtedness owing to it by etailz and/or its equity interest in etailz, each as described in \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d. As a result, there may be instances in which the interest of Mr. Reickert, the Trust and its affiliated entities, Messrs. Marcus and Subin and their respective affiliated entities, and Mr. Simpson and his affiliated entities may conflict or be perceived as being in conflict with the interest of a holder of our securities or the interest of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced and could continue to experience volatility and could decline, resulting in a substantial loss on your investment.\nOur stock price has experienced, and could continue to experience in the future, substantial volatility as a result of many factors, including global economic conditions, broad market fluctuations and public perception of the prospects for the industries in which we operate and the value of our assets. As a result of the FYE Transaction, we are reliant on the performance of etailz, and a failure to meet market expectations, particularly with respect to net revenues, operating margins and earnings per share, would likely result in a further decline in the market price of our stock.\nIf we do not meet the continued listing standards of the NASDAQ, our Common Stock could be delisted from trading, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our Common Stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common stock is listed on NASDAQ, which imposes continued listing requirements with respect to listed shares. On August 15, 2019, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of Common Stock at a ratio of one-for-twenty pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment to the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Secretary of State of the State of New York. The reverse stock split was reflected on NASDAQ beginning with the opening of trading on August 15, 2019. The primary purpose of the reverse stock split, which was approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders at the Company\u2019s Annual Stockholders Meeting on June 27, 2019, was to enable the Company to comply with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on NASDAQ. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or that we will otherwise be in compliance with other NASDAQ listing criteria. If we fail to maintain compliance with the minimum bid requirement or to meet the other applicable continued listing requirements in the future and NASDAQ determines to delist our Common Stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our Common Stock and reduce our ability to raise additional capital.\nThe limited public float and trading volume for our Common Stock may have an adverse impact and cause significant fluctuation of market price.\nHistorically, ownership of a significant portion of our outstanding shares of Common Stock has been concentrated in a small number of stockholders. Consequently, our Common Stock has a relatively small float and low average daily trading volume, which could affect a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell our stock or the price at which it can be sold. In addition, future sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market by those larger stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely impact the market price of the stock and our stock could be difficult for a shareholder to liquidate.\nThe Company intends to continue to undertake one or more corporate initiatives to reduce costs which may include deregistering the Company\u2019s Common Stock under the Exchange Act.\nGiven the Company\u2019s liquidity position, the Company intends to continue to undertake one or more corporate initiatives to reduce costs going forward. We currently incur significant expenses in connection with complying with public company reporting requirements and, as a listed company, we have an obligation to continue to comply with the applicable reporting requirements. As part of its consideration of all available strategic alternatives for the Company, the Board will consider whether, and may conclude that, deregistering our Common Stock, and therefore eliminating the significant expenses associated with complying with public company reporting requirements, is in the best interests of our shareholders. If the Company determines to deregister its Common Stock, following such deregistration, we would no longer be a reporting company and we would cease to file annual, quarterly, current, and other reports and documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as we are permitted to do so under applicable laws, rules and regulations. In such event, our shareholders would have significantly less information about the Company and our business, operations, and financial performance than they have currently. Additionally, termination of our obligation to publicly disclose financial and other information about the Company following the deregistration of our Common Stock under the Exchange Act would make it more difficult (or even impossible) for shareholders to sell shares of Common Stock held by them. Trading in our Common Stock would only occur, if at all, in privately negotiated sales and potentially on an OTC market, if one or more brokers chooses to make a market for our Common Stock on any such market and complies with applicable regulatory requirements. There could be no assurances regarding any such private trading or OTC market trading.", "PERMNO": 10514, "SIC": 5735, "TIC": "KSPN"}
