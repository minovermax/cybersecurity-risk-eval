{"cik": "749038", "company": "CCUR Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-08-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following are various material risks we currently face. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our securities. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, the trading prices of our common stock and other securities we may issue in the future could decline significantly. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.\nThe risk factors below contain forward-looking statements regarding CCUR Holdings. Actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nGeneral Business Risks\nManagement and the Board of Directors could spend or invest the Company\u2019s capital in ways with which some of our stockholders may not agree.\nOur management could spend or invest the Company\u2019s capital in ways with which some of our stockholders may not agree. The Board of Directors may authorize such spending or investment without seeking stockholder approval to the extent permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and/or other applicable governing documents. The investment of the Company\u2019s capital may not yield a favorable return. Investments which yield a higher return may also subject us to incremental risk as compared to government securities or other existing investments.\nWe incurred net losses in the past and may incur further losses in the future.\nWe incurred losses from continuing operations of $6.8 million and $4.7 million in fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. While we had income from continuing operations of $0.6 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, as of June 30, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $150.8 million. We may have difficulty sustaining profitable operations and we may incur additional net losses in the future.\nAny weaknesses identified in our system of internal controls by us or by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) could have an adverse effect on our business.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we implemented additional controls over merger and acquisition activities, as well as controls over our MCA activities and processes, both in consideration of the LuxeMark Acquisition during the period.\nIn future periods, we may identify deficiencies in our system of internal control over financial reporting that may require remediation. There can be no assurances that any such future deficiencies identified will not be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in future periods. Any control deficiency that we may identify in the future could adversely affect our stock price, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with the trend of increased stockholder activism.\nPublicly-traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or of the entire company. Given our significant cash and other asset balances as of June 30, 2019, market capitalization, and other factors, it is possible that stockholders may in the future attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders would be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA failure to detect fraud in the business could be serious.\nWhile we are confident that we have comprehensive controls in place, there can be no assurances that all business fraud will be detected and/or thwarted. A loss related to fraud, especially an uninsured loss, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely extensively on various information systems to manage many aspects of our business, including to process and record our MCA transactions, to enable effective communication systems, to manage logistics and to generate performance and financial reports. We are dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security and oversight for processing, transmission, storage and the protection of our information.\nLike other companies, we are vulnerable to the general increased threat of cybercriminals that may seek to fraudulently gain access to our systems or use false credentials, malware, ransomware, phishing, denial of service and other types of attacks. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that are not presently known and could unexpectedly compromise information security. If we or third parties with which we do business were to fall victim to successful cyber-attacks or experience other cybersecurity incidents, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, which may include: remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the loss business following an attack; litigation and legal risks, including regulatory actions by state or federal governmental authorities; increased cybersecurity and other insurance premiums; reputational and competitive damage and short or long term loss of stockholder value. Despite our efforts, we may not be effective in protecting against cyberattacks or be able to immediately detect any such attacks, as attack methods of and vulnerabilities exploited by cybercriminals consistently evolve. We may experience increased costs associated with maintaining and updating our systems to remain aligned with current vulnerabilities.\nTax-Related Risks\nThe financial impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States could be materially different from our current estimates and may adversely affect our operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d), which enacted the most comprehensive U.S. tax reform legislation in over thirty years. The TCJA includes numerous changes in the U.S. tax code that could affect our business, such as:\n\u00b7 A permanent reduction to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017;\n\u00b7 New limitations on business deductions, including meals and entertainment expense and interest expense;\n\u00b7 Indefinite carryforward periods for net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017, albeit with a new limitation in usage each tax year to 80% of taxable income;\n\u00b7 A new approach to the treatment of foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings, including a one-time repatriation tax (\u201cTransition Tax\u201d) on foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings as of November 2, 2017 or December 31, 2017 (the larger of the two dates). This will be followed by a new system for foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 for global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d). GILTI will be based on the annual aggregate foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings in excess of certain qualified business asset investment returns.\n\u00b7 Elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) system for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, along with provisions for obtaining a refund for any existing AMT credits no later than tax years beginning before January 1, 2022.\n\u00b7 Creation of a new base-erosion, anti-abuse tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d) and a new taxation mechanism for foreign-derived intangible income (\u201cFDII\u201d) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nCertain provisions of the TCJA impacted our financials in fiscal year 2018, primarily related to the lowering of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate. The rate was effective as of January 1, 2018, so we calculated a blended U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 27.55% based on IRS guidance. The other significant impact on our financial statements for fiscal year 2018 was the elimination of the AMT credit regime and the ability to begin claiming any AMT credits as refundable credits in future tax years.\nWe completed our analysis of the impact of the TCJA on our consolidated financial statements during fiscal year 2019. There was no material change in our conclusions from the provisional estimates as a result of this final analysis. We will continue to monitor legislative, regulatory, and judicial interpretations of the TCJA and their potential impact on us in future fiscal years.\nFluctuations in our future effective tax rates could affect our future operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe are required to review our deferred tax assets periodically and determine whether, based on available evidence, a valuation allowance is necessary. Accordingly, we have performed such evaluation, from time to time, based on historical evidence, trends in profitability, expectations of future taxable income, and implemented tax planning strategies.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. In the event we determine that it is appropriate to create a reserve or increase an existing reserve for any such potential liabilities, the amount of the additional reserve is charged as an expense in the period in which it is determined. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment for the applicable period, a further charge to expense in the period such shortfall is determined would result. Such a charge to expense could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations for the applicable period.\nAs of both June 30, 2019 and 2018, we maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in all jurisdictions, except for the $0.5 million AMT credit carryforward that is now considered refundable after the enactment of the TCJA. Changes to our business in the future may require a release of our valuation allowances, which would result in additional tax benefits that would improve our net income. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nFuture issuances or repurchases of our equity, or transfers of our equity by third parties, may impair our future ability to use a substantial amount of our existing NOLs.\nFrom time to time we perform an analysis of the ownership changes in our stock pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As of June 30, 2019, the ownership change was 37.0%, compared to 37.4% as of June 30, 2018. Future transactions and the timing of such transactions could cause an additional ownership change for Section 382 income tax purposes. Section 382 limits the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of its common stock over a three-year period, to utilize its NOLs and certain built-in losses or deductions, as of the ownership change date, that are recognized during the five-year period after the ownership change. Such transactions may include, but are not limited to, additional repurchases or issuances of common stock, or acquisitions or sales of shares of CCUR stock by certain holders of our shares, including persons who have held, currently hold or may accumulate in the future five percent or more of our outstanding common stock for their own accounts. Outside of the rights granted to us through the tax preservation plan approved by stockholders at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, these transactions may be beyond our control, particularly if the tax preservation plan expires. If an additional ownership change were to occur for purposes of Section 382, we would be required to calculate a new annual restriction on the use of our NOLs to offset future taxable income. We could lose all or a substantial part of the benefit of our accumulated NOLs if an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 does occur.\nRecently enacted tax legislation may impact our ability to fully utilize any NOLs generated after calendar year 2017 to fully offset our taxable income in future periods.\nSince the beginning of calendar year 2018, the TCJA generally has permitted us to offset only 80% (rather than 100%) of our taxable income with any NOLs generated after calendar year 2017. Net operating losses subject to these limitations may be carried forward by us for use in later fiscal years, subject to these limitations. These tax law changes could have the effect of causing us to incur income tax liability sooner than we otherwise would have incurred such liability or, in certain cases, could cause us to incur income tax liability that we might otherwise not have incurred in the absence of these tax law changes. The TCJA also includes provisions that, beginning in 2018, reduced the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and eliminated the AMT, which would lessen any adverse impact of the limitations described in the preceding sentences.\nAcquisition Risks\nThe purchase agreements for the Real-Time and Content Delivery business sales and the LuxeMark Acquisition may expose us to contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn each of these sale and acquisition transactions completed since the beginning of calendar year 2017, the applicable purchase agreements included indemnification obligations, often subject to certain carve-out and time limitations, summarized below.\nLuxeMark Acquisition: We have agreed to indemnify the seller for breaches or failures of our representations, warranties or covenants in the asset purchase agreement for the LuxeMark Acquisition or for any fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation.\nContent Delivery Sale: We have agreed to indemnify Vecima for breaches of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by us in the purchase agreement sale of the Content Delivery business (the \u201cCDN APA\u201d) for losses arising out of or in connection with excluded assets or excluded liabilities, and for certain other matters. While the time period for some of the indemnification obligations has expired, we remain subject to indemnification obligations for certain claims set forth in the CDN APA through December 2022 and, in some instances, through December 2024. Other than in the event of fraud or willful misconduct, we will not be obligated to indemnify Vecima for any breach of the representations, warranties, or covenants made by us under the CDN APA until the aggregate amount of claims for indemnification exceed $0.1 million. In the event any permitted indemnification claims exceed this threshold, we will be obligated to indemnify Vecima for any damages or loss resulting from such breach up to 5% of the final purchase price paid by Vecima pursuant to the CDN APA; provided, however, that this capped amount does not apply to damages or losses based on and arising out of fraud or willful misconduct.\nReal-Time Sale: We have agreed to indemnify the purchaser of the Real-Time business (the \u201cRT Purchaser\u201d) for breaches of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by us in the purchase agreement for the Real-Time sale (the \u201cRT APA\u201d) for losses arising out of or in connection with excluded assets or excluded liabilities, and for certain other matters. While the time period for certain indemnification obligations has expired, we remain subject to indemnification obligations for any claims arising out of fraud, breach, or inaccuracies in the fundamental representations set forth in the RT APA, through May 2023, which obligations are not subject to a capped amount.\nThe Company may be subject to additional regulatory rules and regulations as it develops and expands its operations or consummates any business or asset acquisitions, which may cause the Company to incur increased costs to satisfy its compliance requirements or penalties if the Company is unable to satisfy those requirements in a timely manner; the Company may also alter its business structure or status to align its compliance requirements and costs with its continuing operations and business strategy.\nAs the Company develops and expands its continuing operations and considers the acquisition of new business and assets, it continues to assess (i) whether such expansion and development of its continuing operations or potential new business opportunities would subject the Company to additional federal or state law rules and regulations and, if so, to assess the expenses and resources necessary to satisfy those compliance requirements, and (ii) whether its continuing compliance requirements and costs are aligned with its continuing operations and business strategy. The Company may incur significant expenses in making such assessments and implementing any modifications designed to bring current operations and any newly acquired businesses and assets into compliance with applicable federal or state rules and regulations. If the Company is unable to meet any new compliance requirements or to do so in a timely manner it may face penalties or other enforcement remedies from the applicable regulatory entity.\nThe Company may elect to modify its business structure or status, forego a business or acquisition opportunity, or take other action it deems appropriate to remain under or obtain exemption from any compliance requirements it deems to be misaligned with its continuing operations, business strategy, or resources. Any such changes may initially require significant expenses and staff resources or create uncertainty or negative market perceptions about us or our securities.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be successful in reinvesting the Company\u2019s assets or that future businesses and assets in which we invest, if any, will allow us greater ability to utilize our existing NOLs.\nFollowing the LuxeMark Acquisition, we continue to evaluate additional acquisition targets that could provide a greater ability to utilize our remaining NOLs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and successfully complete any additional business or asset acquisitions. The process to identify potential business opportunities and acquisition targets, to investigate and evaluate the future returns therefrom and business prospects thereof, and to negotiate definitive agreements with respect to such transactions on mutually acceptable terms can be time consuming and costly. We have encountered and are likely to continue to encounter intense competition from other companies with similar business objectives to ours, including private equity and venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds, investment firms with significantly greater financial and other resources, and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and executing such transactions. Our financial resources and human resources may be relatively limited when contrasted with many of these competitors. As a result, we may be at a competitive disadvantage with such entities as we seek to identify and acquire additional businesses and assets. Further, managing and growing acquired businesses and assets could require higher corporate expenses, which could also affect our ability to offer competitive terms for any potential acquisition of such businesses or assets.\nWhile we believe that there are several categories of target businesses that we could potentially acquire or invest in, our ability to compete to acquire target businesses that are relatively sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. We may need to obtain additional financing in order to consummate future acquisitions and business opportunities, and there can be no assurances that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are successful in acquiring additional businesses or assets, there can be no assurances that such businesses or assets will produce results allowing us greater ability to utilize our NOLs.\nWe may consider potential business or asset acquisitions in different industries, and stockholders may have no basis at this time to ascertain the merits or risks of any business or asset that we may ultimately operate or acquire.\nOur business strategy contemplates the potential acquisition of one or more additional operating businesses or other assets that we believe will provide better returns on equity than our previous businesses and/or enhance the returns achieved from our current operating segments. Except for the restriction on our ability to compete with our former Real-Time and Content Delivery businesses (pursuant to the terms of the respective purchase agreements), we are not limited to acquisitions in any industry or of any type of business or asset. Accordingly, there is no current basis for stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of a target business or asset with which we may ultimately affect a business combination, acquisition, or other investment. Although we will seek to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business or acquisition opportunity, we cannot assure stockholders that all of the significant risks present in that opportunity will be properly assessed. Even if we properly assess those risks, some of them may be outside of our control or ability to assess. We may pursue business combinations, asset acquisitions, or investments that do not require stockholder approval and, in those instances, stockholders will most likely not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any such transaction before we become committed to the transaction(s).\nResources will be expended in researching potential acquisitions and investments that might not be consummated.\nThe investigation of target businesses and assets and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments has required and will continue to require substantial management time and attention, in addition to costs for accountants, attorneys, and others engaged from time to time to assist management. If a decision is made not to complete a specific business combination, asset acquisition, or other investment, the costs incurred up to that point relating to the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable and would be borne by us. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific opportunity, we may fail to consummate the transaction for any number of reasons, including those beyond our control.\nSubsequent to an acquisition or business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, incur restructuring costs, and incur impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and share price, which could cause stockholders to lose some or all of their investments.\nEven if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine or an asset which we acquire, we cannot assure stockholders that this diligence will identify all material issues that may be present with respect to a particular target business or asset, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary and reasonable amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise, and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items, and therefore will not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or associated with a target asset, or by virtue of our obtaining debt financing in connection with our future operations. Accordingly, stockholders could suffer a significant reduction in the value of their shares.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or other securities to complete business combinations or under employee incentive plans. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue shares of our common stock or preferred stock, from time to time, in their business judgment, up to the amount of our then-authorized capitalization. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock, and may issue shares of our preferred stock, in order to complete business combinations, raise additional capital, or under employee incentive plans. These issuances:\n\u00b7 may significantly dilute stockholders\u2019 equity interests;\n\u00b7 may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of our common stock if shares of preferred stock are issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;\n\u00b7 could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our NOLs and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u00b7 may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination or acquire assets, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition, and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment in us.\nAlthough we have no commitments as of the date of this report to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur indebtedness, we may choose to incur substantial debt to finance our growth plans. The incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\u00b7 default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination or asset acquisition are insufficient to repay our debt obligations\u037e\n\u00b7 acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness, even if we make all principal and interest payments when due, if we breach covenants that require the maintenance of financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of the covenants\u037e\n\u00b7 our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand\u037e\n\u00b7 our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding\u037e\n\u00b7 our inability to pay any declared dividends on our common stock\u037e\n\u00b7 using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock, if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes\u037e\n\u00b7 limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industries in which we operate or intend to operate\u037e\n\u00b7 increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry, and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation\u037e and\n\u00b7 limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy, and other purposes, and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nWe may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect a business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications, or abilities to manage the target business.\nWhen evaluating a prospective target business, even with diligent efforts, we may not be able to assess the performance of the target business\u2019 management fully, due to necessary restraints on time, resources, and information. Moreover, when assessing private companies, it may be difficult to assess how well a target company\u2019s management will be able to adjust to operating within the confines of a public company structure. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target\u2019s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect, and such management may lack the skills, qualifications, or abilities we expected. Should the target\u2019s management not possess the skills, qualifications, or abilities necessary to manage such business or operate within the confines of a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted.\nWe may attempt to complete business combinations with private companies about which limited information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we expected, if at all.\nIn pursuing our business acquisition strategy, we may seek to effect business combinations with privately-held companies. By definition, very little public information exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination based on limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we expect, if at all.\nWe may be required to expend substantial sums in order to bring the companies we acquire into compliance with the various reporting requirements applicable to public companies and/or to prepare required financial statements, and such efforts may harm our operating results or be unsuccessful altogether.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our management to assess the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting for the companies we acquire. In order to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we will need to implement or enhance internal control over financial reporting at any company we acquire, and evaluate the company\u2019s internal controls. We do not conduct a formal evaluation of companies\u2019 internal control over financial reporting prior to an acquisition. We may be required to hire or engage additional resources and incur substantial costs to implement the necessary new internal controls should we acquire any companies. Any failure to implement required internal controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or increase the risk of material weaknesses in internal controls, which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\nWe may make acquisitions or investments where we do not own all or a majority of the target enterprise.\nWe may make acquisitions or investments where we do not own all or a majority of the target enterprise. We may engage in such acquisitions or make such investments where we desire the target management to continue to have a significant equity incentive to grow and ensure the profitability of the target business. We may also make such acquisitions or investments where we do not have sufficient financial resources to acquire all of the equity in the target company or where the target has price requirements that we are unwilling to meet at the time of the acquisition or investment. Our minority- or less-than-100%-ownership subjects us to risks that we do not completely control the target company and its results of operations, business condition, or prospects may be materially adversely impacted by the decisions of the other equity owners or the difficulty of negotiating among equity owners.\nWe will be unable to compete with the Content Delivery business or the Real-Time business for a period of three years after the date of the closing of the sale of each respective business.\nIn connection with the closing of the sale of the Content Delivery business and the closing of the sale of the Real-Time business, we agreed to be bound by restrictive covenants for a period of three years following the closing of each respective transaction, which provide that until the third anniversary following the applicable transaction closing, we will not:\n\u00b7 engage in any activity that competes with the Content Delivery business as it was conducted by us prior to the closing of the sale of the Content Delivery business or the Real-Time business as it was conducted by us prior to the closing of the sale of the Real-Time business;\n\u00b7 solicit or recruit any employees transferred to Vecima or the RT Purchaser; or\n\u00b7 own, manage, operate, assist, invest in, or acquire any person or entity that competes with the Content Delivery business or the Real-Time business (except for ownership of 5% or less of the outstanding securities of a publicly-traded entity).\nWe have implemented certain anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe are subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination involving a merger or sale of more than 10% of our assets with any stockholder, including affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s stock, except under limited circumstances.\nThere are provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws that also may delay, deter, or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control.\nAdditionally, see the risk factor below that discusses our formal amendment to our certificate of incorporation adopted by our stockholders at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on November 8, 2018, designed to limit our exposure to an ownership change, and as further discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, or present other challenges, such as integration issues, for our business, which, if not successfully resolved, would adversely affect our business.\nWe are currently reviewing acquisition prospects, and in the event of any future acquisitions, we could issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, or assume contingent liabilities. These actions could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. Acquisitions also entail numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7 difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies, or services;\n\u00b7 unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7 adverse effects on existing business relationships;\n\u00b7 risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and\n\u00b7 potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire in the future. Our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may be limited in the types of acquisitions that we can pursue in order to preserve use of our NOLs.\nWe currently have NOLs of $56.8 million as of June 30, 2019. We may be able to achieve greater realization of the value of our NOLs with certain business or asset acquisitions. There is no guarantee that we will be able to find or consummate an acquisition that allows for utilization of our NOLs and we may engage in acquisitions that do not facilitate use of the NOLs. In any acquisition, we may be limited by our available cash and cash equivalents or our ability to obtain financing in order to preserve use of our NOLs. Use of our NOLs can be impaired by certain shifts in the ownership of our common stock and, thus, we are limited in our ability to use stock in an acquisition for NOL preservation purposes. Alternatively, while we have not identified or committed to any such transactions, we may identify acquisitions that we believe will provide value sufficient to forego preservation of the NOLs to participate in the acquisition opportunity.\nSecurities Related Risks\nTrading on the OTCQB Venture Market may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Venture Market operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB market is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTCQB market is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB market is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a stock exchange like the NASDAQ Stock Market (the \u201cNASDAQ\u201d) or the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d). Accordingly, our stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares.\nWe may be unable to relist our common stock on the NASDAQ or any other exchange.\nIf the Board of Directors determines that it is in the best interests of the Company to resume trading our common stock on the NASDAQ or trading on another stock exchange if and when we meet the applicable listing requirements, we will need to reapply to the NASDAQ or apply to such other exchange to have our stock listed. The application process can be lengthy, and there is no assurance that the NASDAQ or such other exchange will relist our common stock. If we are unable to relist our common stock, or even if our common stock is relisted, no assurance can be provided that an active trading market will develop or, if one develops, will continue.\nChanges in market conditions may impact any stock repurchases, and stock repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nOn March 5, 2018, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. In January 2019, we completed the purchase of the authorized one million shares and the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 500,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock under a new repurchase program that replaces and supersedes the prior repurchase program. Purchases are made through private transactions or open market purchases, which may be made pursuant to trading plans subject to the restrictions and protections of Rule 10b5-1 and/or Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may resolve to discontinue stock repurchases at any time.\nAny repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility. There can be no assurance that the repurchases will be made at the best possible price. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that stock repurchases will create value for stockholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Our stock purchase program is intended to deliver stockholder value over the long-term, but short-term stock price fluctuations can reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nWe may be subject to price risk associated with our equity securities and fixed-maturity debt securities portfolio and loans involved in our real estate operations.\nWe are exposed to market risks and fluctuations primarily through changes in fair value of available-for-sale fixed-maturity and equity securities which the Company holds. As of February 2019, our Asset Manager exclusively manages our securities portfolio, and is required under the Management Agreement to adhere to an investment strategy approved by our Board of Directors\u2019 Asset Management Committee, which sets restrictions on the amount of certain securities and other assets that we may acquire and on our overall investment strategy.\nMarket prices for fixed maturity and equity securities are subject to fluctuation; as a result, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments, and general market conditions. Because our fixed-maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale, the hypothetical decline would not affect current earnings except to the extent that the decline reflects an \u201cother-than-temporary\u201d impairment.\nWe are also subject to risks and fluctuations in the market prices in the real estate market based on the secured real estate loans and assets that we hold as a part of our real estate operations. As a result, the amount that we may be able to realize upon default of any of our loans collateralized by real property may significantly differ from the reported value.\nTo the extent payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest constitutes a portion of our income, we will be exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash representing such income.\nCertain of our investments include PIK interest arrangements, which represent contractual interest added to loan balances and due at the end of each loan\u2019s term. To the extent PIK interest constitutes a portion of our income, we are exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash, including the following:\n\u00b7 The higher interest rates of PIK instruments reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with these instruments, and PIK instruments generally represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans.\n\u00b7 Even if the accounting conditions for income accrual are met, the borrower could still default at the maturity of the obligation.\n\u00b7 PIK instruments may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral.\nWe are exposed to financial risks that may be partially mitigated, but cannot be eliminated, by our hedging activities, which carry their own risk.\nWe may use financial instruments for hedging and risk management purposes in order to protect against possible fluctuations in the market, fluctuations in foreign currencies, or for other reasons that we deem appropriate. The success of our hedging strategy will be subject to our ability to assess counterparty risk correctly, along with our ability to continually recalculate, readjust, and execute hedges in an efficient and timely manner. Thus, though we may enter into these types of transactions to seek to reduce risks, unanticipated events may create a more negative consequence than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. Any failure to manage our hedging positions properly or inability to enter into hedging instruments upon acceptable terms could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nReal Estate Risks\nBecause real estate assets are relatively illiquid, we may not be able to diversify, liquidate, or monetize our real estate portfolio in response to changes in economic and other relevant conditions, which may result in losses. The illiquidity of our real estate portfolio may also result in our seeking financing in order to expand our operations while maintaining sufficient liquid assets to execute our business plan.\nReal estate assets are relatively illiquid. A variety of factors could make it difficult for us to modify our real estate portfolio in response to changing economic or other relevant conditions, thus creating risk of loss associated with those changed conditions. In addition, we may seek to restrict the percentage of our assets that are contained in illiquid real estate assets by seeking financing to continue expansion of our real estate operations while maintaining sufficient liquid assets to execute our business plan and invest in other value producing assets, including acquisition of additional businesses and assets. Further, reserving a certain percentage of our liquid assets may benefit our financial performance by increasing our ability to modify our operations to respond to adverse economic or other relevant conditions. Any financing that we obtain creates risks normally associated with financing, including the risk that our cash flow is insufficient to make timely payments of interest or principal.\nWe may engage in real estate transactions or other strategic opportunities that involve property types or structures with which we have less familiarity, thereby increasing our risk of loss.\nWe may decide to participate in real estate transactions and other strategic opportunities in which we have limited or no prior experience. When engaging in such transactions, we may not be successful in our due diligence and underwriting efforts. We may also be unsuccessful in preserving value if conditions deteriorate, and we may expose ourselves to unknown substantial risks. Furthermore, engaging in unfamiliar transactions may require additional management time and attention relative to transactions with which we are more familiar. All of these factors increase our risk of loss.\nManagement Agreement Risks\nFailure of the Asset Manager to perform its obligations to us effectively could have an adverse effect on our business and performance.\nWe have engaged the Asset Manager to provide asset management and other services to us pursuant to the Management Agreement. Our ability to achieve investment and business objectives will be impacted by the performance of the Asset Manager and its ability to provide us with asset management and other services. If, for any reason, the Asset Manager is unable to perform such services at the level we require or expect, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nThe fee structure with the Asset Manager could encourage the Asset Manager to invest our assets in riskier investments.\nThe Asset Manager has discretionary management authority over our portfolio of publicly traded securities, subject to our investment policy and subject to oversight of the Asset Management Committee and Board of Directors. The Asset Manager has the ability to earn a management fee paid through cash-settled stock appreciation rights that vest upon designated changes in control. The management fee is calculated based on the value of our total assets, which may create incentive for our Asset Manager to invest, to the extent permitted by our investment policy, in investments with higher yield potential that are generally riskier or more speculative, or sell an investment prematurely for a gain, in an effort to increase our short-term net income and thereby increase the fee to which it is entitled. If our interests and those of the Asset Manager are not aligned, the execution of our business plan and results of operations could be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe Asset Manager may not be successful in equitably allocating investment opportunities among its managed accounts.\nThe Management Agreement requires the Asset Manager to act in a fair and reasonable manner in allocating investment and trading opportunities among our account and any other accounts managed by the Asset Manager or any of its affiliates. Specifically, the Asset Manager is charged with (i) considering participation of our account in all appropriate opportunities within the purpose and scope of our objectives that are under consideration for the accounts of other clients of the Asset Manager or any of its affiliates, (ii) executing orders on an equitable basis whenever it would be appropriate for our account and the Asset Manager\u2019s other managed accounts to participate in an investment opportunity and (iii) causing our account to pay or receive a price that is no less favorable than the average of the prices paid by the Asset Manager\u2019s other managed accounts. However, there is no assurance that the Asset Manager will be able to eliminate any conflicts of interest arising from the allocation of investment opportunities. In addition, the Asset Manager assists with the Company\u2019s identification of target businesses and assets for acquisition. The Asset Manager may identify target operating businesses and assets that would be appropriate for acquisition by us and by other entities managed by the Asset Manager and, after consideration of relevant factors, the Asset Manager may determine the target opportunity is more suitable for us or a different entity.\nThe Asset Manager manages our portfolio pursuant to broad investment guidelines, and the Board of Directors and Asset Management Committee do not approve each investment and financing decision made by the Asset Manager unless required by our investment guidelines.\nPursuant to the Management Agreement, the Asset Manager has exclusive authority to manage the Company\u2019s securities investment portfolio pursuant to the parameters set in our investment guidelines. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews our investment guidelines but does not, and is not required to, review of all our proposed investments except in certain circumstances outlined in the investment guidelines. While the Asset Manager is required to provide reporting of transactions undertaken on our behalf, those transactions may be costly, difficult, or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by the Board of Directors. Our Asset Manager has flexibility within the broad parameters of our investment guidelines in determining the types and amounts of investments in which to invest on our behalf, including making investments that may result in returns that are substantially below expectations or result in losses, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results.\nMCA Risks\nWe participate in the MCA industry, which presents unique risks.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we first acquired certain MCA assets from an MCA originator and funder that is a leader in the MCA sector. We continue to participate in MCA activity. The MCA activity presents unique risks, including the illiquidity of the cash advances; our critical reliance on certain individuals to operate the business; collection issues and challenges given that the MCAs are generally non-recourse; and sensitivity to general economic and regulatory conditions.\nAn increase in merchant non-payment may reduce our overall profitability and historical merchant default rates may not be indicative of future results.\nRates at which merchants do not repay amounts owed under MCA transactions may be significantly affected by economic downturns or general economic conditions beyond our control or beyond the control of the merchants who repay the amounts advanced based on the volume of their revenue streams. Merchant nonpayment rates may increase due to factors such as the level of consumer and business confidence, the value of the U.S. dollar, changes in consumer and business spending, the number of personal and business bankruptcies, and other factors. While we do not transact directly with merchants, we have purchased participation interests in MCAs through funders that directly advance funding amounts to merchants, and the returns received for those participation interests are at risk if merchants do not complete repayment. Additionally, the fees obtained by LMCS for its administrative and servicing functions to funders and syndicate participants may be negatively impacted if merchant nonpayment rates are higher than the historical rates.\nOur allowance for MCA losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors and may not be adequate to absorb any actual MCA losses.\nWe face the risk that merchants will fail to repay advances made in MCA transactions. We reserve for such losses by establishing an allowance for MCA losses, the increase of which results in a reduction of our earnings as we record a provision expense for MCA losses. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for MCA losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, it is also dependent on our subjective assessment based upon our experience and judgment. Actual losses are difficult to forecast and, as a result, there can be no assurance that our allowance for MCA losses will be sufficient to absorb any actual losses or to prevent a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a limited history in an evolving MCA industry which makes it difficult to evaluate future prospects and risk.\nBecause of the rapidly-evolving nature of the MCA industry, even though we have conducted due diligence and engaged employees, consultants, and advisors with MCA expertise and experience, adequate assessment of future prospects and risk management regarding the MCA business may still prove challenging. These risks and difficulties include our ability to:\n\u00b7 manage our growth potential to achieve desired profitability but with adequate provisions to mitigate risk;\n\u00b7 maintain or increase our syndicate network of syndicate participants and funders;\n\u00b7 develop and deploy new MCA-related services to provide additional services to, and receive additional compensation from, our existing network,\n\u00b7 develop and deploy new MCA-related services that will attract a wider network and enable us to compete favorably;\n\u00b7 compete with other companies that are in or entering the MCA market and that may provide similar or expanded services;\n\u00b7 successfully mitigate against fluctuations in the economic market that impact the MCA industry;\n\u00b7 effectively determine proper expansion to any additional jurisdictions, including international jurisdictions; and\n\u00b7 successfully evaluate and continue to modify the MCA business under the relevant regulatory scheme.\nWe may not be able to address these risks and difficulties successfully, which could harm our business and operating results.\nIf we decide to expand our MCA business domestically or internationally, we may be exposed to substantially greater business and regulatory risk that negatively impacts the results of our operations.\nWe currently operate the MCA business primarily in the United States, in the state of New York, with some limited MCAs funded in Australia, but we may seek to expand our business further throughout the United States and internationally. Such expansion could subject our business to substantial risks including:\n\u00b7 necessary changes to the operations of the MCA business to accommodate varying state and international regulations, customs, and economic conditions and needs;\n\u00b7 competition with service providers that have greater experience in the local markets than we do or pre-existing relationships that provide significant leverage;\n\u00b7 difficulties in providing adequate staffing and managing operations in different locales;\n\u00b7 potentially conflicting and evolving laws and regulations within different jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 risks of transacting in foreign currencies and the associated exposure;\n\u00b7 difficulties of reconciling different taxing regimes; and\n\u00b7 regional economic and political conditions.\nThe MCA industry may become highly regulated and regulations may continue to vary widely as the MCA industry starts to become less concentrated in certain areas and more widely accessible across the United States and international territories.\nOver the last few years, as the MCA industry has grown, state and federal regulators and other policymaking entities have taken an increased interest in the industry. As a result, the industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. In 2018, for example, the California legislature passed a law, SB 1235, requiring MCA originators to provide truth-in-lending type disclosures. State and federal regulators have also begun investigating the industry and exploring whether additional laws and regulations are needed to manage this evolving industry. These investigations may result in legislative, regulatory, or enforcement initiatives that could impact our business operations if the initiatives result in new laws, regulations, or enforcement priorities. We may not be able to forecast new laws or regulations, or changes in regulatory or judicial interpretations of laws or regulations, that may result from these investigations, and any additional regulatory compliance may require us to modify our business operations in a manner that negatively impacts the results of our operations.\nIn addition, if new laws and regulations, or changes in regulatory or judicial interpretations of laws or regulations, are imposed inconsistently, in terms of their manner and timing, across the jurisdictions in which our MCA business operates, this may create greater difficulty and expense in satisfying our regulatory compliance requirements. It may also result in conflicting requirements between different jurisdictions. While our MCA-related contracts typically contain \u201cchoice of law\u201d provisions, the parties\u2019 choice of law is not guaranteed to be recognized and respected by a court depending upon the facts and circumstances considered to be determinative by the relevant court. If the law of a state or jurisdiction is applied that is different from our selected choice of law, or if court or other judicial bodies render decisions that change the way applicable laws are applied with respect to the MCA industry, we may be subject to unanticipated laws and regulations that require additional expenses and resources for compliance or incur penalties for any failure to do so that affects our operating and performance results. For example, if courts or other judicial bodies recharacterize our MCAs as loans, then licensing, usury, or other regulatory requirements may apply depending on the jurisdiction, and our transactions could be challenged by regulators, attorneys general or our customers.\nA material failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in enforcement actions, lawsuits, and penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results\nUnauthorized disclosure of merchant data, even if due to a third party\u2019s improper action, could expose us to liability or investigation that would cause us to expend significant time and resources.\nAs a part of our leads program at LMCS, we connect funders that have been unable to fund all of their merchant applications in order to enable other funders that have available capital to fund those applications. Our agreements with the funders require them to provide representations and warranties that they have obtained the necessary permissions and undertaken any other requirements under applicable law with respect to disclosure of the merchant\u2019s application information before providing such information to other funders. Funders are required under our agreements to indemnify us for any costs we incur due to their breach of these representations and warranties. While we only connect the funders and do not maintain merchant information, we may still be subject to regulatory inquiries and be required to expend significant time and costs in response if any of the funders have not complied with their obligations regarding this information under applicable law. We may also engage in litigation with funders based on breach of their representations and warranties and/or their failure to indemnify us for related costs. Our involvement in any regulatory actions, even if not directed at us, may require us to make significant efforts to change our structure or services, or damage our business and reputation, which could have a negative impact on our operating revenues.", "PERMNO": 51829, "SIC": 6500, "TIC": "CCUR"}
