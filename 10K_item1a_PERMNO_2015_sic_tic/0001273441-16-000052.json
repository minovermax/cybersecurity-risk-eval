Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nGuerrilla Activity in Colombia Has Disrupted and Delayed, and Could Continue to Disrupt or Delay, Our Operations and We May Be Unable to Safeguard Our Operations and Personnel in Colombia.\nDuring 2012 and 2013, guerrilla activity in Colombia increased significantly, and the activity level remained high in 2014 and 2015. This increased activity creates a greater risk for our operations and our employees.\nFor over 40 years, the Colombian government has been engaged in a conflict with two main Marxist guerrilla groups: the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\"FARC\") and the National Liberation Army (\"ELN\"). Both of these groups have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States and the European Union. Another threat comes from criminal gangs\nformed from the former members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia militia, a paramilitary group that originally sprouted up to combat FARC and ELN, which the Colombian government successfully dissolved.\nNegotiations between the government and FARC may lead to a peaceful resolution and may not generate the intended outcome for either party. The impact of these negotiations, or any potential resolution, is not determinable on our operations.\nWe operate principally in the Putumayo Basin in Colombia, and have properties in other basins, including the Catatumbo, Cauca, Llanos, Sinu-San Jacinto, Middle Magdalena and Lower Magdalena Basins. Pipelines have been primary targets of guerrilla activity, because such pipelines cannot be adequately secured due to the sheer length of such pipelines and the remoteness of the areas in which the pipelines are laid. The CENIT S.A (\"CENIT\")-operated Trans-Andean oil pipeline (the \"OTA pipeline\u201d), which transports oil from the Putumayo region to the Port of Tumaco and which is one of our export routes, has been targeted by FARC. Starting in 2008, the OTA pipeline experienced outages of various lengths. Since 2012, the OTA pipeline has been shut down for 784 days (including 166 days as a result of landslides and maintenance works). Such disruptions may continue indefinitely and could harm our business.\nContinuing attempts by the Colombian government to reduce or prevent guerrilla activity may not be successful and dissident guerrilla activity may continue to disrupt our operations in the future. Our efforts to increase security measures may not be successful and there can also be no assurance that we can maintain the safety of our or our contractors' field personnel and Bogota head office personnel or operations in Colombia or that this violence will not continue to adversely affect our operations in the future and cause significant loss.\nWe Are Vulnerable to Risks Associated with Geographically Concentrated Operations.\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in Colombia, and as at December 31, 2015, 87% of our proved reserves were located in Colombia. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of, among other things, regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation or guerilla activities, transportation constraints or market limitations.\nIf We do Not Have the Resources to Execute on Our Business Plan, We May Be Required to Curtail Our Operations.\nOur base capital program for 2016 is $107 million to fund our exploration and development, which we intend to fund through cash flows from operations and cash on hand. Funding this program relies in part on oil prices remaining close to current levels or higher and other factors to generate sufficient cash flow. In addition to our base 2016 capital program we have a discretionary capital program of $61 million that we may utilize during 2016 if oil prices strengthen during the year. Oil prices were very volatile in 2014 and 2015 and have remained at low levels in the first part of 2016. Low oil prices affect our debt capacity and the amount of money we can borrow using our oil reserves as collateral, as well as the amount of cash we are able to generate from operations. If cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our capital program, we may not be able to execute our business plan which would cause us to further decrease our exploration and development, which could harm our business outlook, investor confidence and our share price.\nWe May Encounter Difficulties Storing and Transporting Our Production, Which Could Cause a Decrease in Our Production or an Increase in Our Expenses.\nTo sell the oil and natural gas that we are able to produce, we have to make arrangements for storage and distribution to the market. We rely on local infrastructure and the availability of transportation for storage and shipment of our products, but infrastructure development and storage and transportation facilities may be insufficient for our needs at commercially acceptable terms in the localities in which we operate. This could be particularly problematic to the extent that our operations are conducted in remote areas that are difficult to access, such as areas that are distant from shipping and/or pipeline facilities. In certain areas, we may be required to rely on only one gathering system, trucking company or pipeline, and, if so, our ability to market our production would be subject to their reliability and operations. These factors may affect our ability to explore and develop properties and to store and transport our oil and gas production, and may increase our expenses. Furthermore, future instability in one or more of the countries in which we operate, weather conditions or natural disasters, actions by companies doing business in those countries, labor disputes or actions taken by the international community may impair the distribution of oil and/or natural gas and in turn diminish our financial condition or ability to maintain our operations.\nThe majority of our oil in Colombia is shipped through the OTA pipeline owned by CENIT and operated by Ecopetrol. Sales of oil have been and could continue to be disrupted by damage to this pipeline or displaced by Ecopetrol\u2019s use of the pipeline itself. In addition, CENIT has a monopoly over pipeline transportation from the area and Ecopetrol over the operation of the port of Tumaco, which limits our ability to negotiate proposed pipeline and port tariff increases and our costs may increase as a\nresult. Under our transportation contract with CENIT, the delivery point for our oil is at the end of this pipeline. This creates a risk of loss of oil due to sabotage by guerrillas or theft from the pipeline which may result in reduced revenues and increased clean-up or third party costs. CENIT and Ecopetrol maintain responsibility for clean-up of any spilled oil and for pipeline repair.\nIf these pipelines remain down for extended periods of time, our storage facilities may become full, which may cause us to limit producing activities. In addition, there is competition for space in these pipelines, and additional discoveries in our area of operations by other companies could decrease the pipeline capacity available to us. Trucking is an alternative to transportation by pipeline; however, it is generally more expensive and carries higher safety risks for us, our employees and the public.\nSignificant percentages of our 2014 and 2015 production were transported by alternative means. These alternatives are more expensive and reduce our average realized prices. In addition, these alternative means of transportation may not be sustainable long term. When disruptions are of a long enough duration, our sales volumes may be lower than normal, which will cause our cash flow to be lower than normal, and if our storage facilities become full, we can be forced to reduce production.\nWe May Be Unable to Obtain Additional Capital That We Will Require to Implement Our Business Plan, Which Could Restrict Our Ability to Grow.\nIn the event that our cash flow from existing operations and cash on hand is not sufficient, we may require additional capital to fund our currently planned activities or to expand our exploration and development programs to additional properties. We may be unable to obtain additional capital on favorable terms or at all.\nIf we require additional capital, we may pursue sources of capital through various financing transactions or arrangements, including joint venturing of projects, debt financing, equity financing or other means. We may not be able to access capital on favorable terms or at all. If we do succeed in raising additional capital, future financings may be dilutive to our shareholders, as we could issue additional shares of Common Stock or other equity to investors. In addition, debt and other mezzanine financing may involve a pledge of assets and may be senior to interests of equity holders. We may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertibles and warrants, which will adversely impact our financial results.\nOur ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by factors such as the capital markets (both generally and for the oil and gas industry in particular), the location of our oil and natural gas properties in South America, prices of oil and natural gas on the commodities markets (which will impact the amount of asset-based financing available to us), and the loss of key management. Further, if oil and/or natural gas prices on the commodities markets decrease, then our revenues will likely decrease, and such decreased revenues may increase our requirements for capital. The price of oil and natural gas also effects the value of our oil and natural gas reserves, which dictates our capacity to borrow using those reserves as collateral. Some of the contractual arrangements governing our exploration activity may require us to commit to certain capital expenditures, and we may lose our contract rights if we do not have the required capital to fulfill these commitments. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our cash flow from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs (even to the extent that we reduce our activities), we may be required to curtail our operations.\nThe Borrowing Base Under Our Revolving Credit Facility May Be Reduced in Light of Recent Commodity Price Declines, Which Could Hinder or Prevent us From Meeting Our Future Capital Needs.\nThe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently $200 million, and lender commitments under our revolving credit facility are $500 million. Our borrowing base is redetermined by the lenders twice per year, and the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination is in May 2016. Our borrowing base may decrease as a result of current oil and natural gas price levels, a further decline in oil or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason. We cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. In the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to current or further declines in commodity prices or otherwise, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due and could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. In addition, we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital market to meet our obligations. As a result, we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out our business plan, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness.\nOur Business is Subject to Local Legal, Political and Economic Factors Which Are Beyond Our Control, Which Could Impair Our Ability to Expand Our Operations or Operate Profitably.\nWe operate our business in Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, and may eventually expand to other countries. Exploration and production operations in foreign countries are subject to legal, political and economic uncertainties, including terrorism, military repression, social unrest, strikes by local or national labor groups, interference with private contract rights (such as nationalization), extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, high rates of inflation, exchange controls, changes in tax rates, changes in laws or policies affecting environmental issues (including land use and water use), workplace safety, foreign investment, foreign trade, investment or taxation, as well as restrictions imposed on the oil and natural gas industry, such as restrictions on production, price controls and export controls. Our production in Brazil was shut in for three weeks in October 2013 as a result of a strike by employees of Petrobras which affected the crude oil receiving terminal we use in the Rec\u00f4ncavo Basin, and we experienced minor delays in trucking operations due to demonstrations and strikes in our operating area during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2015. We do not know how long any such labor action will last, and if it lasts a significant amount of time, it may affect our ability to meet our production targets.\nSouth America has a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies, laws or regulations that might assume a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment, including the imposition of additional taxes. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreign-owned assets. Any changes in oil and gas or investment regulations and policies or a shift in political attitudes in Colombia, Peru or Brazil or other countries in which we intend to operate are beyond our control and may significantly hamper our ability to expand our operations or operate our business at a profit.\nChanges in laws in the jurisdiction in which we operate or expand into with the effect of favoring local enterprises, and changes in political views regarding the exploitation and protection of natural resources and economic pressures, may make it more difficult for us to negotiate agreements on favorable terms, obtain required licenses, comply with regulations or effectively adapt to adverse economic changes, such as increased taxes, higher costs, inflationary pressure and currency fluctuations. In certain jurisdictions the commitment of local business people, government officials and agencies and the judicial system to abide by legal requirements and negotiated agreements may be more uncertain, creating particular concerns with respect to licenses and agreements for business. These licenses and agreements may be susceptible to revision or cancellation and legal redress may be uncertain or delayed.\nRecently, in the Department of Putumayo in Colombia where we operate, despite a company\u2019s compliance with legislative requirements for prior consultation of communities and minority ethnic groups and the receipt of the necessary permits to drill and operate, new ethnic groups have been threatening, and in some cases using, the Judicial Branch of the Government, Superior Court of the Judicial District of Mocoa (the \u201cLocal Court\u201d) to require that they be consulted, and thereby obtain benefits from companies operating in the Department of Putumayo as a result of those consultations. The Local Court has the ultimate jurisdiction to determine, upon a writ for protection or tutela, by an ethnic group (i) whether there has been a violation of a fundamental right to prior consultation by act or omission of a public authority or individual and (ii) whether the ethnic group is legitimate. If the Local Court determines that there has been a violation and the ethnic group is legitimate despite receipt by the company of its proper governmental permits, the Local Court has the power to invalidate a company\u2019s permits and force the company to cease operations immediately until such time as the company can successfully appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn the Local Court\u2019s decision or prior consultations are completed and the permits effective once again.\nProperty right transfers, joint ventures, licenses, license applications or other legal arrangements pursuant to which we operate may be adversely affected by the actions of government and judicial authorities and the effectiveness of and enforcement of our rights under such arrangements in these jurisdictions may be impaired and, if we are faced with a tutela, our operations in the area(s) governed by a Local Court\u2019s order may be shut down for a period of time thereby causing significant harm to our business in Colombia.\nRecently in Brazil, environmental regulations related to fracture stimulation drilling have been under review by national agencies. In December 2014, the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Petr\u00f3leo G\u00e1s Natural e Biocombust\u00edveis (\"ANP\") issued an injunction specifically related to properties in the Rec\u00f4ncavo Basin covered by Bid Round 12. This injunction placed a moratorium on unconventional activities on the Bid Round 12 blocks, all of which were unconventional exploration targets, until such a time as policies governing unconventional activities are finalized. Blocks REC-T-129, REC-T-142, REC-T-155 and REC-T-224 were granted in Bid Round 9, for which there has not been a similar injunction; however, we expect that the ANP\u2019s injunction may limit our ability to receive permits in the short-term for our blocks with unconventional exploration targets. We acquired Blocks REC-T-86, REC-T-117 and REC-T-118 in Bid Round 11 and these blocks may be affected by the same or a similar injunction as the one placed on blocks acquired in Bid Round 12. Until this situation is resolved, the expansion of our drilling operations in Brazil may be limited which would harm our business in Brazil.\nPending regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.\nGovernments around the world have become increasingly focused on regulating greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and addressing the impacts of climate change in some manner. Brazil, Peru and Colombia all have enacted legislation related to GHG emissions. For example, in July 2015, Colombia announced that it will seek to reduce the national emission of greenhouse gases by at least 20% over the next 15 years. Colombia has also passed legislation requiring the country to generate 77% of its energy from renewable resources and reduce deforestation in the Amazon to zero by 2020. Peru and Brazil have passed similar climate change-related measures.\nGHG emissions legislation is emerging and is subject to change. For example, on an international level, almost 200 nations agreed on December 12, 2015, to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France, that calls for countries to set their own GHG emission targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emission targets. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nCurrent GHG emissions legislation has not resulted in material compliance costs, however, it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted, and any such future laws and regulations could result in additional compliance costs or additional operating restrictions. If we are unable to recover a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, to the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of or access to capital.\nAlmost All of Our Cash and Cash Equivalents is Held Outside of Canada and the United States, and if We Determine to, or Are Required to, Repatriate These Funds, We Could Be Subject to Taxes.\nAt December 31, 2015, 92% of our cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries and partnerships outside of Canada and the United States. This cash is generally not available to fund domestic or head office operations unless funds are repatriated. At this time, we do not intend to repatriate funds, but if we did, we might have to accrue and pay taxes in certain jurisdictions on the distribution of accumulated earnings.\nStrategic and Business Relationships Upon Which We May Rely Are Subject to Change, Which May Diminish Our Ability to Conduct Our Operations.\nOur ability to successfully bid on and acquire additional properties, to discover reserves, to participate in drilling opportunities and to identify and enter into commercial arrangements will depend on developing and maintaining effective working relationships with industry participants and on our ability to select and evaluate suitable partners and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. These relationships are subject to change and may impair our ability to grow.\nTo develop our business, we enter into strategic and business relationships, which may take the form of joint ventures with other parties or with local government bodies, or contractual arrangements with other oil and gas companies, including those that supply equipment and other resources that we will use in our business. We also have an active business development program to develop those relationships and foster new relationships. We may not be able to establish these business relationships, or if established, we may choose the wrong partner or we may not be able to maintain them. In addition, the dynamics of our relationships with strategic partners may require us to incur expenses or undertake activities we would not otherwise be inclined to take to fulfill our obligations to these partners or maintain our relationships. If we fail to make the cash calls required by our joint venture partners in the joint ventures we do not operate, we may be required to forfeit our interests in these joint ventures. If our strategic relationships are not established or maintained, our business prospects may be limited, which could diminish our ability to conduct our operations.\nIn cases where we are the operator, our partners may not be able to fulfill their obligations, which would require us to either take on their obligations in addition to our own, or possibly forfeit our rights to the area involved in the joint venture. In addition, despite our partner\u2019s failure to fulfill its obligations, if we elect to terminate such relationship, we may be involved in litigation with such partners or may be required to pay amounts in settlement to avoid litigation despite such partner\u2019s failure to perform. Alternatively, our partners may be able to fulfill their obligations, but will not agree with our proposals as operator of the property. In this case there could be disagreements between joint venture partners that could be costly in terms of dollars, time, deterioration of the partner relationship, and/or our reputation as a reputable operator. These joint venture partners may not comply with their responsibilities or may engage in conduct that could result in liability to us.\nIn cases where we are not the operator of the joint venture, the success of the projects held under these joint ventures is substantially dependent on our joint venture partners. The operator is responsible for day-to-day operations, safety, environmental compliance and relationships with government and vendors.\nWe have various work obligations on our blocks that must be fulfilled or we could face penalties, or lose our rights to those blocks if we do not fulfill our work obligations. Failure to fulfill obligations in one block can also have implications on the ability to operate other blocks in the country ranging from delays in government process and procedure to loss of rights in other blocks or in the country as a whole. Failure to meet obligations in one particular country may also have an impact on our ability to operate in others.\nDisputes or Uncertainties May Arise in Relation to Our Royalty Obligations\nOur production is subject to royalty obligations which may be prescribed by government regulation or by contract. These royalty obligations may be subject to changes in interpretation as business circumstances change.\nAs discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 below, our production from the Costayaco Exploitation Area is subject to the HPR royalty, which applies when cumulative gross production from an Exploitation Area is greater than five MMbbl. The HPR royalty is calculated on the difference between a trigger price defined in the Chaza Contract and the sales price. The ANH has interpreted the Chaza Contract as requiring that the HPR royalty must be paid with respect to all production from the Moqueta Exploitation Area and initiated a noncompliance procedure under the Chaza Contract, which we contested because the Moqueta Exploitation Area and the Costayaco Exploitation Area are separate Exploitation Areas. ANH did not proceed with that noncompliance procedure. We also believe that the evidence shows that the Costayaco and Moqueta Fields are two clearly separate and independent hydrocarbon accumulations. Therefore, it is our view that, pursuant to the terms of the Chaza Contract, the HPR royalty is only to be paid with respect to production from the Moqueta Exploitation Area when the accumulated oil production from that Exploitation Area exceeds five MMbbl. Discussions with the ANH have not resolved this issue and we have initiated the dispute resolution process under the Chaza Contract by filing on January 14, 2013, an arbitration claim before the Center for Arbitration and Conciliation of the Chamber of Commerce of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, seeking a decision that the HPR royalty is not payable until production from the Moqueta Exploitation Area exceeds five MMbbl. We supplemented our claim on May 30, 2013. The ANH has filed a response to the claim seeking a declaration that its interpretation is correct and a counterclaim seeking, amongst other remedies, declarations that we breached the Chaza Contract by not paying the disputed HPR royalty, that the amount of the alleged HPR royalty that is payable, and that the Chaza Contract be terminated. We filed a response to the ANH's counterclaim and filed our comments on the ANH defense to our claim. The ANH filed an amended counterclaim and we filed a response to the ANH's amended counterclaim. In April 2015, total cumulative production from the Moqueta Exploitation Area exceeded 5.0 MMbbl and we commenced paying the HPR royalty. The estimated compensation which would be payable on cumulative production prior to that date if the ANH is successful in the arbitration is $66.3 million plus related interest of $26.5 million. We also disagree with the interest rate that the ANH has used in calculating the interest cost. We assert that since the HPR royalty is denominated in the U.S. dollar, the contract requires the interest rate to be three-month LIBOR plus 4%, whereas the ANH has applied the highest legally authorized interest rate on Colombian peso liabilities, which during the period of production to date has averaged approximately 29% per annum. At December 31, 2015, based on an interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 4% related interest would be $6.4 million. At this time no amount has been accrued in the financial statements nor deducted from our reserves for the disputed HPR royalty as we do not consider it probable that a loss will be incurred.\nAdditionally, the ANH and Gran Tierra are engaged in discussions regarding the interpretation of whether certain transportation and related costs are eligible to be deducted in the calculation of the HPR royalty. Discussions with the ANH are ongoing. Based on our understanding of the ANH's position, the estimated compensation which would be payable if the ANH\u2019s interpretation is correct could be up to $44.8 million as at December 31, 2015. At this time no amount has been accrued in the financial statements as we do not consider it probable that a loss will be incurred.\nMaintaining Good Community Relationships and Being a Good Corporate Citizen May Be Costly and Difficult to Manage.\nOur operations have a significant effect on the areas in which we operate. Maintaining good community relationships is an essential aspect of operating in the oil and gas industry. Communities have demonstrated an ability and willingness to halt operations or delay approvals.\nTo enjoy the support and trust of local populations and governments, we must demonstrate a commitment to: providing local employment, training and business opportunities; a high level of environmental performance; open and transparent communication; a willingness to discuss and address community issues including community development investments that are carefully selected, not unduly costly and bring lasting social and economic benefits to the community and the area. Improper\nmanagement of these relationships could lead to a delay in operations, loss of license or major impact to our reputation in these communities, which could adversely affect our business.\nCompetition in Obtaining Rights to Explore and Develop Oil and Gas Reserves and to Market Our Production May Impair Our Business.\nThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive. Other oil and gas companies will compete with us by bidding for exploration and production licenses and other properties and services we will need to operate our business in the countries in which we expect to operate. Additionally, other companies engaged in our line of business may compete with us from time to time in obtaining capital from investors. Competitors include larger companies, which, in particular, may have access to greater resources than us, may be more successful in the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and may conduct their own refining and petroleum marketing operations, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, actual or potential competitors may be strengthened through the acquisition of additional assets and interests. In the event that we do not succeed in negotiating additional property acquisitions, our future prospects will likely be substantially limited, and our financial condition and results of operations may deteriorate.\nOur Business May Suffer if We do Not Attract and Retain Talented Personnel.\nOur success will depend in large measure on the abilities, expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith of our executive team and other personnel in conducting our business. The loss of any of these individuals or our inability to attract suitably qualified individuals to replace any of them could materially adversely impact our business.\nOur success depends on the ability of our management and employees to interpret market and geological data successfully and to interpret and respond to economic, market and other business conditions to locate and adopt appropriate investment opportunities, monitor such investments and ultimately, if required, successfully divest such investments. Further, our key personnel may not continue their association or employment with us and we may not be able to find replacement personnel with comparable skills. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe Acquisitions of Petroamerica and PGC May Not Generate the Results Expected and Could be Difficult to Integrate.\nIn January 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Petroamerica and PGC. There can be no assurance that these acquisitions will generate the expected returns and other projected results we anticipate. For example, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated synergies of the acquisitions, including expected increases in revenue and cost savings. If we fail to effectively integrate Petroamerica and PGC, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Volatility May Affect Our Financial Results.\nWe expect to sell our oil and natural gas production under agreements that will be denominated in U.S. dollars. Many of the operational and other expenses we incur will be paid in the local currency of the country where we perform our operations. Our income taxes in Colombia are paid in Colombian pesos. As a result, we are exposed to translation risk when local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars, our functional currency. We are also exposed to transaction risk on settlement of payables and receivables denominated in foreign currency. Between January 1, 2014 and February 23, 2016, exchange rates between the Colombian peso and U.S. dollar have varied between 1,844 pesos to one U.S. dollar to 3,440 pesos to one U.S. dollar, a fluctuation of approximately 87%. Production in Brazil is invoiced and paid in Brazilian Reals. Between January 1, 2014 and February 23, 2016, the exchange rate of the Brazilian Real has varied between 2.19 Reals to one U.S. dollar to 4.18 Reals to the U.S. dollar, a variance of 91%. Current and deferred tax liabilities in Colombia are denominated in Colombian pesos and the Colombian peso weakened by 32% against the U.S. dollar in the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in a foreign exchange gain.\nOur Operations Involve Substantial Costs and Are Subject to Certain Risks Because the Oil and Gas Industries in the Countries in Which We Operate Are Less Developed.\nThe oil and gas industry in South America is not as efficient or developed as the oil and gas industry in North America. As a result, our exploration and development activities may take longer to complete and may be more expensive than similar operations in North America. The availability of technical expertise, specific equipment and supplies may be more limited than in North America. We expect that such factors will subject our international operations to economic and operating risks that may not be experienced in North American operations.\nFurther, we operate in remote areas and may rely on helicopter, boats or other transportation methods. Some of these transport methods may result in increased levels of risk and could lead to operational delays which could effect our ability to add to our reserve base and/or produce oil, serious injury or loss of life and could have a significant impact on our reputation or cash flow. Additionally, some of this equipment is specialized and may be difficult to obtain in our areas of operations, which could hamper or delay operations, and could increase the cost of those operations.\nExchange Controls and New Taxes Could Materially Affect Our Ability to Fund Our Operations and Realize Profits from Our Foreign Operations.\nForeign operations may require funding if their cash requirements exceed operating cash flow. To the extent that funding is required, there may be exchange controls limiting such funding or adverse tax consequences associated with such funding. In addition, taxes and exchange controls may affect the dividends that we receive from foreign subsidiaries.\nThe government in Brazil requires us to register funds that enter and exit the country with the central bank. In Brazil and Colombia, all transactions must be carried out in the local currency of the country. Exchange controls may prevent us from transferring funds abroad.\nIn Colombia, we participate in a special exchange regime, which allows us to receive revenue in U. S. dollars offshore. This regime gives us flexibility to determine the currency in which we receive our revenues, rather than to be restricted to Colombian pesos if received in Colombia, but also limits the ways in which we are able to fund our operations in Colombia. As such, this could cause us to employ funding strategies for our Colombian operations that are not as tax efficient as might otherwise be possible if we did not participate in the special exchange regime.\nTax law changes can impact the after tax profits available for expatriation. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2014 the Colombian government approved tax legislation increasing the rate of tax applicable to ordinary income from 34% in 2014 to 39% for 2015, 40% for 2016, 42% for 2017 and 43% for 2018. In the same legislation, the Colombian government also instituted a new \u201cwealth tax\u201d payable on the net equity of our Colombia business units at a rate of 1.15% for 2015, 1% for 2016 and 0.4% for 2017.\nNegative Political Developments in Peru May Negatively Affect our Proposed Operations.\nPeru held a national election in June 2011 after which a new political regime was elected on a left-populist platform. The government has said that the past decade prioritized the strengthening of democracy with economic growth, while the current government will enhance social inclusion to benefit the neediest. This political regime may adopt new policies, laws and regulations that are more hostile toward foreign investment which may result in the imposition of additional taxes, the adoption of regulations that limit price increases, termination of contract rights, or the expropriation of foreign-owned assets. Such actions by the elected political regime could limit the amount of our future revenue in that country and affect our results of operations. The next general elections in Peru will be held on April 10, 2016 and the current incumbent President, Ollanta Humala, will not seek to run again for presidency in this election.\nGuerrilla Activity in Peru Could Disrupt or Delay Our Operations and We Are Concerned About Safeguarding Our Operations and Personnel in Peru.\nThe Shining Path Guerilla group has been active in Peru since the early 1980\u2019s and, at one point, was active throughout the country. Recently, the group\u2019s activity has been confined to small areas of Peru and operations have been hampered by the capture of many high profile leaders and membership has fallen dramatically. During April 2012, 30 people working on the Camisea natural gas project in central Peru were kidnapped. Most of the workers were released after a short period of time, and the remainder were freed within a few days. The kidnapping was attributed to the Shining Path Guerilla group. Camisea is a very large, high profile project in an area where the group continues to be active. Our operations in Peru are in a different region, with no known activity by the group. Other groups may be active in other areas of the country and possibly our operational areas. Recently there have been security incidents and incidents of social unrest in and around our operating areas, including Block 107, and activities in the areas surrounding the block are to be considered with caution due to the eradication of illegal farms by the government.\nWe May Not Be Able to Effectively Manage Our Growth, Which May Harm Our Profitability.\nOur strategy envisions continually expanding our business, both organically and through acquisition of other properties and companies. If we fail to effectively manage our growth or integrate successfully our acquisitions, our financial results could be adversely affected. Growth may place a strain on our management systems and resources. Integration efforts place a significant\nburden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the integration process could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we must continue to refine and expand our business development capabilities, our systems and processes and our access to financing sources. As we grow, we must continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new or acquired employees. We may not be able to:\n\u2022\nexpand our systems effectively or efficiently or in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nallocate our human resources optimally;\n\u2022\nidentify and hire qualified employees or retain valued employees; or\n\u2022\nincorporate effectively the components of any business that we may acquire in our effort to achieve growth. If we are unable to manage our growth and our operations our financial results could be adversely affected by inefficiencies, which could diminish our profitability.\nThe United States Government May Impose Economic or Trade Sanctions on Colombia That Could Result In a Significant Loss to Us.\nColombia is among several nations whose eligibility to receive foreign aid from the United States is dependent on its progress in stemming the production and transit of illegal drugs, which is subject to an annual review by the President of the United States. Although Colombia is currently eligible for such aid, Colombia may not remain eligible in the future. A finding by the President that Colombia has failed demonstrably to meet its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements may result in any of the following:\n\u2022\nall bilateral aid, except anti-narcotics and humanitarian aid, would be suspended;\n\u2022\nthe Export-Import Bank of the United States and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation would not approve financing for new projects in Colombia;\n\u2022\nUnited States representatives at multilateral lending institutions would be required to vote against all loan requests from Colombia, although such votes would not constitute vetoes; and\n\u2022\nthe President of the United States and Congress would retain the right to apply future trade sanctions.\nEach of these consequences could result in adverse economic consequences in Colombia and could further heighten the political and economic risks associated with our operations there. Any changes in the holders of significant government offices could have adverse consequences on our relationship with ANH and Ecopetrol and the Colombian government\u2019s ability to control guerrilla activities and could exacerbate the factors relating to our foreign operations. Any sanctions imposed on Colombia by the United States government could threaten our ability to obtain necessary financing to develop the Colombian properties or cause Colombia to retaliate against us, including by nationalizing our Colombian assets.\nAccordingly, the imposition of the foregoing economic and trade sanctions on Colombia would likely result in a substantial loss and a decrease in the price of shares of our Common Stock. The United States may impose sanctions on Colombia in the future, and we cannot predict the effect in Colombia that these sanctions might cause.\nWe Are Subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a Violation of Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit corporations and individuals, including us, our subsidiaries and affiliates, partners, and our employees, contractors, and agents working on behalf, from making improper payments to government officials and certain other individuals and organizations for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or engaging in certain accounting practices. We do business and may do future business in countries in which we may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, international organizations, or private entities. As a result, we face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by employees, contractors agents, and partners of ours or our subsidiaries or affiliates, even though these parties are not always subject to our control or direction. It is our policy to implement compliance procedures to prohibit these practices. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective or may not be followed, and our employees, contractors, agents, and partners may engage in illegal conduct for which we might be held responsible. Also, the FCPA contains certain accounting standards which obligate us to maintain accurate and complete books and records and a system of effective internal controls. These accounting provisions are very broad and a violation can occur even if there is no\nevidence of a bribe or unauthorized payment. The U.S. government is actively investigating and enforcing the FCPA and similar laws against companies and individuals. A violation of any of these laws, even if prohibited by our policies, may result in criminal or civil sanctions or other penalties (including profit disgorgement), could disrupt our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation, be expensive to investigate and defend, and impair our ability to do business. A number of countries, including Canada and Brazil, have strengthened their anti-corruption legislation and enforcement. These laws prohibit both domestic and international bribery. There is a risk that an act of corruption can result in a violation of not only the FCPA, but also the laws of several other countries, and expose us to investigation and enforcement outside of the U.S.\nOur Business Could Be Negatively Impacted by Security Threats, Including Cybersecurity Threats as Well as Other Disasters, and Related Disruptions.\nOur business processes depend on the availability, capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. It is critical to our business that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure. We cannot guarantee that measures taken to defend against cybersecurity threats will be sufficient for this purpose. The ability of the information technology function to support our business in the event of a security breach or a disaster such as fire or flood and our ability to recover key systems and information from unexpected interruptions cannot be fully tested and there is a risk that, if such an event actually occurs, we may not be able to address immediately the repercussions of the breach or disaster. In that event, key information and systems may be unavailable for a number of days or weeks, leading to our inability to conduct business or perform some business processes in a timely manner. We have implemented strategies to mitigate impacts from these types of events.\nOur employees have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails to misappropriate information or to introduce viruses or other malware through \u201ctrojan horse\u201d programs to our computers. These emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by us but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information through email or download malware. Despite our efforts to mitigate \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails through education, \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d activities remain a serious problem that may damage our information technology infrastructure.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nUnless We Are Able to Replace Our Reserves, and Develop and Manage Oil and Gas Reserves and Production on an Economically Viable Basis, Our Reserves, Production and Cash Flows May Decline as a Result.\nOur future success depends on our ability to find, develop and acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Without successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our reserves and production will decline. We may not be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs.\nTo the extent that we succeed in discovering oil and/or natural gas, reserves may not be capable of production levels we project or in sufficient quantities to be commercially viable. On a long-term basis, our viability depends on our ability to find or acquire, develop and commercially produce additional oil and gas reserves. Without the addition of reserves through exploration, acquisition or development activities, our reserves and production will decline over time as reserves are produced. Our future reserves will depend not only on our ability to develop and effectively manage then-existing properties, but also on our ability to identify and acquire additional suitable producing properties or prospects, to find markets for the oil and natural gas we develop and to effectively distribute our production into our markets. Future oil and gas exploration may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs.\nCompletion of a well does not assure a profit on the investment or recovery of drilling, completion and operating costs. In addition, drilling hazards or environmental damage could greatly increase the cost of operations, and various field operating conditions may adversely affect the production from successful wells. These conditions include delays in obtaining governmental approvals or consents, shut-downs of connected wells resulting from extreme weather conditions, problems in storage and distribution and adverse geological and technical conditions. While we will endeavor to effectively manage these conditions, we may not be able to do so optimally, and we will not be able to eliminate them completely in any case. Therefore, these conditions could diminish our revenue and cash flow levels and result in the impairment of our oil and natural gas interests.\nEstimates of probable and possible reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than\nproved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Possible reserves are even less certain and generally require only a 10% or greater probability of being recovered. All categories of reserves are continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. Estimates of probable and possible reserves are by their nature much more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and are subject to greater uncertainties, and accordingly the likelihood of recovering those reserves is subject to substantially greater risk.\nIn addition, the quantity and value of our reserves directly effects our ability to access certain kinds of external financing that uses our reserves as collateral. Low oil prices diminish the value of our oil reserves, thus diminishing not only current cash flow, but debt capacity and access to other forms of capital as well. This could impair our ability to carry out the exploration and development activity required to replace our reserves.\nPrices and Markets for Oil and Natural Gas Are Unpredictable and Tend to Fluctuate Significantly, Which Could Reduce Our Profitability, Growth and Value.\nOil and natural gas are commodities whose prices are determined based on world demand, supply and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. World prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated widely in recent years. Spot prices for West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") declined from approximately $106 per bbl in June 2014 to less than $30 per bbl in January 2016. The spot price for Brent oil declined from approximately $115 per bbl in June 2014 to less than $30 per bbl in January 2016.\nGiven the current economic environment and unstable conditions in the Middle East, North Africa, China, and Eastern Europe and the current supply of oil in world markets, the oil price environment is unpredictable and unstable. We expect that prices will fluctuate in the future. Price fluctuations will have a significant impact upon our revenue, the return from our oil and gas reserves and on our financial condition generally. Price fluctuations for oil and natural gas commodities may also impact the investment market for companies engaged in the oil and gas industry. Furthermore, prices which we receive for our oil sales, while based on international oil prices, are established by contract with purchasers with prescribed deductions for transportation and quality differentials. These differentials can change over time and have a detrimental impact on realized prices. Future decreases in the prices of oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, the future results of our operations, financing available to us, and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis.\nOil prices in Colombia are related to international market prices, but adjustments that are defined by contracts with offtakers may cause realized prices to be lower or higher than those received in North America. Oil prices in Brazil are defined by contract with the refinery and may be lower or higher than those received in North America.\nOur Exploration for Oil and Natural Gas Is Risky and May Not Be Commercially Successful, Impairing Our Ability to Generate Revenues from Our Operations.\nOil and natural gas exploration involves a high degree of risk. These risks are more acute in the early stages of exploration. Our exploration expenditures may not result in new discoveries of oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities or at a commercially viable cost. It is difficult to project the costs of implementing an exploratory drilling program due to the inherent uncertainties of drilling in unknown formations, the costs associated with encountering various drilling conditions, such as over pressured zones and tools lost in the hole, and changes in drilling plans and locations as a result of prior exploratory wells or additional seismic data and interpretations thereof. The target location may be drilled again in the future with a revised drilling plan. If exploration costs exceed our estimates, or if our exploration efforts do not produce results which meet our expectations, our exploration efforts may not be commercially successful, which could adversely impact our ability to generate revenues from our operations. In addition, changes in the price of oil can affect the commercial success of our exploration activity. If the oil price declines drastically, such as it did at the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015, some projects that were previously considered commercially successful may not be at low oil price levels and may be deferred, which means that our short to medium term production and cash flow may be lower than previously anticipated.\nIf Oil and Natural Gas Prices Decrease, or Our Operating Results are Different Than We Expect, We May Be Required to Take Write-Downs of the Carrying Value of Our Oil and Natural Gas Properties.\nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties. A separate cost center is maintained for expenditures applicable to each country in which we conduct exploration and/or production activities. Under this method, the net book value of properties on a country-by-country basis, less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated \u201cceiling\u201d. The ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties, discounted at 10% per year. In calculating discounted future net revenues, oil and natural gas prices are determined using the average price during the 12 months period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the balance sheet, calculated as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month within such period for that oil and natural gas. That average price is\nthen held constant, except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts. The net book value is compared with the ceiling on a quarterly basis. The excess, if any, of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense. Under full cost accounting rules, any write-off recorded may not be reversed even if higher oil and natural gas prices increase the ceiling applicable to future periods. Future price decreases could result in reductions in the carrying value of such assets and an equivalent charge to earnings. In countries where we do not have proved reserves, dry wells drilled in a period would directly result in an impairment for that period.\nWe Are Required to Obtain Licenses and Permits to Conduct Our Business and Failure to Obtain These Licenses Could Cause Significant Delays and Expenses That Could Materially Impact Our Business.\nWe are subject to licensing and permitting requirements relating to exploring and drilling for and development of oil and natural gas, including seismic, environmental and many other operating permits. We may not be able to obtain, sustain or renew such licenses and permits on a timely basis or at all. In addition, environmental and social evaluation demands have increased in Colombia, causing permit processing to take longer than previously experienced in the areas where we operate and, in some areas where we operate, such as the Department of Putumayo, despite the receipt of the proper permits, there are new procedures being utilized by new ethnic communities to make further economic demands on operators to continue to operate in the region, such as the use of the Local Court to obtain a tutela, or writ of protection. These delays and demands are also significantly impacting other industry participants. Regulations and policies relating to these licenses and permits may change, be implemented in a way that we do not currently anticipate or take significantly greater time to obtain. These licenses and permits are subject to numerous requirements, including compliance with the environmental regulations of the local governments. As we are not the operator of all the joint ventures we are currently involved in, we may rely on the operator to obtain all necessary permits and licenses. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be prevented from drilling for oil and natural gas, and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability or fines. Revocation or suspension of our environmental and operating permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves That We Make May Be Inaccurate and Our Actual Revenues May Be Lower and Our Operating Expenses May Be Higher Than Our Financial Projections.\nWe make estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, upon which we will base our financial projections. We make these reserve estimates using various assumptions, including assumptions as to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Some of these assumptions are inherently subjective, and the accuracy of our reserve estimates relies in part on the ability of our management team, engineers and other advisors to make accurate assumptions. Wells that are drilled may not achieve the results expected from interpretation of geological data. Economic factors beyond our control, such as world oil prices, interest rates and exchange rates, will also impact the value of our reserves. The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex, and will require us to use significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each property. As a result, our reserve estimates will be inherently imprecise. Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those we estimate. If actual production results vary substantially from our reserve estimates, this could materially reduce our revenues and result in the impairment of our oil and natural gas interests.\nExploration, development, production (including transportation and workover costs), marketing (including distribution costs) and regulatory compliance costs (including taxes) will substantially impact the net revenues we derive from the oil and gas that we produce. These costs are subject to fluctuations and variation in different locales in which we operate, and we may not be able to predict or control these costs. If these costs exceed our expectations, this may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to earn net revenue at our predicted levels, which may impact our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nOur Inability to Obtain Necessary Facilities and/or Equipment Could Hamper Our Operations.\nOil and natural gas exploration and development activities are dependent on the availability of drilling and related equipment, transportation, power and technical support in the particular areas where these activities will be conducted, and our access to these facilities may be limited. To the extent that we conduct our activities in remote areas, needed facilities or equipment may not be proximate to our operations, which will increase our expenses. For example, our development and exploration projects in Peru are in remote areas that require barge and helicopter transportation which adds dramatically to the cost of these operations. Demand for such limited equipment and other facilities or access restrictions may affect the availability of such equipment to us and may delay exploration and development activities. The quality and reliability of necessary facilities or equipment may also be unpredictable and we may be required to make efforts to standardize our facilities, which may entail\nunanticipated costs and delays. Shortages and/or the unavailability of necessary equipment, transportation or other facilities will impair our activities, either by delaying our activities, increasing our costs or otherwise.\nDecommissioning Costs Are Unknown and May Be Substantial; Unplanned Costs Could Divert Resources from Other Projects.\nWe are responsible for costs associated with abandoning and reclaiming some of the wells, facilities and pipelines which we use for production of oil and gas reserves. Abandonment and reclamation of these facilities and the costs associated therewith is often referred to as \u201cdecommissioning.\u201d We have determined that we require a reserve account for these potential costs in respect of our current properties and facilities at this time, and have booked such reserve on our financial statements. If decommissioning is required before economic depletion of our properties or if our estimates of the costs of decommissioning exceed the value of the reserves remaining at any particular time to cover such decommissioning costs, we may have to draw on funds from other sources to satisfy such costs. The use of other funds to satisfy decommissioning costs could impair our ability to focus capital investment in other areas of our business.\nEnvironmental Risks May Adversely Affect Our Business.\nAll phases of the oil and natural gas business present environmental risks and hazards and are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of international conventions and federal, provincial and municipal laws and regulations. Environmental legislation provides for, among other things, restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases or emissions of various substances used or produced in association with oil and gas operations. The legislation also requires that wells and facility sites be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Compliance with such legislation can require significant expenditures and a breach may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, some of which may be material. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner likely to result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The discharge of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to liabilities to foreign governments and third parties and may require us to incur costs to remedy such discharge. The application of environmental laws to our business may force us to curtail our production as a result of restrictions imposed by government regulators, or increase the costs of our production, development or exploration activities because of increased compliance costs.\nPenalties We May Incur Could Impair Our Business.\nOur exploration, development, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively under foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Under these laws and regulations, we could be held liable for personal injuries, property damage, site clean-up and restoration obligations or costs and other damages and liabilities. We may also be required to take corrective actions, such as installing additional safety or environmental equipment, which could require us to make significant capital expenditures. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including the assessment of natural resource damages. We could be required to indemnify our employees in connection with any expenses or liabilities that they may incur individually in connection with regulatory action against them. As a result of these laws and regulations, our future business prospects could deteriorate and our profitability could be impaired by costs of compliance, remedy or indemnification of our employees, reducing our profitability.\nPolicies, Procedures and Systems to Safeguard Employee Health, Safety and Security May Not Be Adequate.\nOil and natural gas exploration and production is dangerous. Detailed and specialized policies, procedures and systems are required to safeguard employee health, safety and security. We have undertaken to implement what we believe to be best practices for employee health, safety and security; however, if these policies, procedures and systems are not adequate, or employees do not receive adequate training, the consequences can be severe including serious injury or loss of life, which could impair our operations and cause us to incur significant legal liability.\nOur Insurance May Be Inadequate to Cover Liabilities We May Incur.\nOur involvement in the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas properties may result in our becoming subject to liability for pollution, blowouts, property damage, personal injury or other hazards. Our insurance has limitations on liability that may not be sufficient to cover the full extent of such liabilities. In addition, such risks may not in all circumstances be insurable or, in certain circumstances, we may choose not to obtain insurance to protect against specific risks due to the high premiums associated with such insurance or for other reasons. The payment of such uninsured liabilities would reduce the funds available to us. If we suffer a significant event or occurrence that is not fully insured, or if the insurer of such event is not\nsolvent, we could be required to divert funds from capital investment or other uses towards covering our liability for such events.\nChallenges to Our Properties May Impact Our Financial Condition.\nTitle to oil and natural gas interests is often not capable of conclusive determination without incurring substantial expense. While we intend to make appropriate inquiries into the title of properties and other development rights we acquire, title defects may exist. In addition, we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance for title defects, on a commercially reasonable basis or at all. If title defects do exist, it is possible that we may lose all or a portion of our right, title and interest in and to the properties to which the title defects relate.\nFurthermore, applicable governments may revoke or unfavorably alter the conditions of exploration and development authorizations that we procure, or third parties may challenge any exploration and development authorizations we procure. Such rights or additional rights we apply for may not be granted or renewed on terms satisfactory to us.\nIf our property rights are reduced, whether by governmental action or third party challenges, our ability to conduct our exploration, development and production may be impaired. See the risk factor \"Disputes or Uncertainties May Arise in Relation to Our Royalty Obligations\" for a description of our dispute with the ANH regarding royalties payable on our Chaza Block and the resulting challenge to our contract for that block.\nWe Will Rely on Technology to Conduct Our Business and Our Technology Could Become Ineffective or Obsolete.\nWe rely on technology, including geographic and seismic analysis techniques and economic models, to develop our reserve estimates and to guide our exploration and development and production activities. We will be required to continually enhance and update our technology to maintain its efficacy and to avoid obsolescence. The costs of doing so may be substantial, and may be higher than the costs that we anticipate for technology maintenance and development. If we are unable to maintain the efficacy of our technology, our ability to manage our business and to compete may be impaired. Further, even if we are able to maintain technical effectiveness, our technology may not be the most efficient means of reaching our objectives, in which case we may incur higher operating costs than we would were our technology more efficient.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe Market Price of Our Common Stock May Be Highly Volatile and Subject to Wide Fluctuations.\nThe market price of shares of our Common Stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndilution caused by our issuance of additional shares of Common Stock and other forms of equity securities, which we expect to make in connection with acquisitions of other companies or assets;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new acquisitions, reserve discoveries or other business initiatives by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in revenue from our oil and natural gas business;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market and/or WTI or Brent price for oil and natural gas commodities and/or in the capital markets generally, or under our credit agreement;\n\u2022\nchanges in the demand for oil and natural gas, including changes resulting from the introduction or expansion of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nchanges in the social, political and/or legal climate in the regions in which we will operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of similarly situated companies, both in our industry and in other industries;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 estimates affecting us, our competitors and/or our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in the accounting methods used in or otherwise affecting our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in independent reserve estimates related to our oil and gas properties;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products available to the oil and natural gas industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by relevant governments pertaining to incentives for alternative energy development programs;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates and the availability of capital in the capital markets; and\n\u2022\nsignificant sales of shares of our Common Stock, including sales by future investors in future offerings we expect to make to raise additional capital.\nIn addition, the market price of shares of our Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, which could include the following, among others:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nadditions and departures of key personnel.\n\u2022\nupdated reserve estimates by independent parties.\nThese and other factors are largely beyond our control, and the impact of these risks, singularly or in the aggregate, may result in material adverse changes to the market price of shares of our Common Stock and/or our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do Not Expect to Pay Dividends in the Foreseeable Future.\nWe do not intend to declare dividends for the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will reinvest any future earnings in the development and growth of our business. Therefore, investors will not receive any funds unless they sell their shares of Common Stock, and shareholders may be unable to sell their shares on favorable terms or at all. Investors cannot be assured of a positive return on investment or that they will not lose the entire amount of their investment in shares of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 92619, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "GTE"}
