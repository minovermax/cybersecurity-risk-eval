{"cik": "944765", "company": "MERGE HEALTHCARE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nDiscussion of our business and operating results included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, prospects, or the market price of our common stock in a material and adverse manner. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance. We undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements.\nReductions in Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement Rates for Imaging Procedures and Professional Services or Delays in the Payment of Reimbursements could Negatively Affect Revenues of our Hospital and Imaging Clinic Customers, which could cause our Customers to Reduce or Delay Purchases of our Software and Services.\nThe ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their services from these programs and payors is critical to our success. Reductions in the amount of reimbursements or uncertainty or delays in those reimbursements have in the past, and could in the future, cause our customers to cancel or delay making new expenditures on healthcare IT. Federal budget reductions can affect the timing of the sales of our software and services.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has enacted far-reaching health system reform legislation that could have a negative impact on our business. While the impact of the legislation is difficult to predict, the legislation will increase pressure to control spending in government programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) and by third party payors. For example, changes in the equipment utilization rate, once fully implemented, have the potential to decrease technical reimbursements for radiology procedures, and could have a particularly negative impact on hospitals and imaging clinics in rural regions of the country where utilization rates are naturally lower. A second significant potential reimbursement change relates to the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) component of the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. The SGR is part of the update factor process used to set the annual rate of growth in allowed reimbursable medical expenditures, and is determined by a formula specified by Congress. Because the annual calculation of the SGR would have led to reimbursement reductions that Congress found unacceptable, Congress has interceded on an annual basis to delay the implementation of this statutory SGR update factor. While these changes have provided temporary reimbursement relief to healthcare providers and us, because of the significant budgetary impacts, Congress has retained the SGR formula, thereby allowing annual unimplemented payment reductions to accumulate in the Medicare statute. The current SGR fix delay expires in March, and there are again various proposals to implement a permanent fix. The changes being considered have the potential to negatively impact the professional component of any reimbursement system. In addition, the SGR delay legislation contained many additional reimbursement provisions, such as the mandate to delay the implementation of ICD-10 for one year.\nAnnual changes related to CMS reimbursement inputs and the SGR calculation could result in a reduction in software and service procurement of our customers, and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\nWe are Subject to Government Regulation, Changes to which could Negatively Impact our Business.\nWe are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including periodic FDA inspections, in Canada under Health Canada\u2019s Medical Devices Regulations, and in other countries by corresponding regulatory authorities. We may be required to undertake additional actions in the U.S. to comply with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), regulations promulgated under the FDCA, and any other applicable regulatory requirements. For example, the FDA has increased its focus on regulating computer software intended for use in a healthcare setting. If our software solutions are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the FDA, we could be subject to more extensive requirements governing pre- and post-marketing activities. Complying with these regulations could be time consuming and expensive, and may include:\n\u00b7 Requiring us to receive FDA clearance of a pre-market notification submission demonstrating substantial equivalence to a device already legally marketed, or to obtain FDA approval of a pre-market approval application establishing the safety and effectiveness of the software;\n\u00b7 Requiring us to comply with rigorous regulations governing the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, distribution, labeling and promotion of medical devices; and\nIndex\n\u00b7 Requiring us to comply with the FDCA regarding general controls, including establishment registration, device listing, compliance with good manufacturing practices, reporting of specified malfunctions and adverse device events.\nSimilar obligations may exist in other countries in which we do business, including Canada. Any failure by us to comply with other applicable regulatory requirements, both domestic and foreign, could subject us to a number of enforcement actions, including warning letters, fines, product seizures, recalls, injunctions, total or partial suspensions of production, operating restrictions or limitations on marketing, refusals of the government to grant new clearances or approvals, withdrawals of marketing clearances or approvals and civil and criminal penalties.\nWe are subject to periodic FDA inspections and there can be no assurances that we will not be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the FDCA and any other applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure by us to comply with the FDCA and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to manufacture and distribute our software solutions. The FDA has many enforcement tools including recalls, seizures, injunctions, civil fines and/or criminal prosecutions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in Federal and State Regulations Relating to Handling of Data and Data Privacy could Depress the Demand for our Software and Impose Significant Software Redesign Costs.\nFederal regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) impose national health data standards on healthcare providers that conduct electronic health transactions, healthcare clearinghouses that convert health data between HIPAA compliant and non-compliant formats and health plans. Collectively, these groups are known as covered entities. HIPAA regulations prescribe transaction formats and code sets for electronic health transactions, protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and require covered entities to implement administrative, physical and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Although we are not a covered entity, most of our customers are, and they require that our software and services adhere to HIPAA regulations. Any failure or perceived failure of our software or services to meet HIPAA regulations, or any breach of the HIPAA regulations or any other federal, state or foreign data privacy laws or regulations, could result in remediation costs and fines, and could adversely affect demand for our software and services and potentially require us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to modify our software or services to address the privacy and security requirements of our clients.\nStates and foreign jurisdictions have adopted, or may adopt, privacy standards that are similar to or more stringent than the federal HIPAA privacy regulations. This may lead to different restrictions for handling individually identifiable health information. As a result, our customers may demand IT solutions and services that are adaptable to reflect different and changing regulatory requirements, which could increase our development costs. In the future, federal, state or foreign governmental authorities may impose new data security regulations or additional restrictions on the collection, use, transmission and other disclosures of health information. We cannot predict the potential impact that these future rules may have on our business; however, the demand for our software and services may decrease if we are not able to develop and offer software and services that can address the regulatory challenges and compliance obligations facing our clients.\nOur Business could be Harmed by Adverse General Economic and Market Conditions.\nOur markets have been and will continue to be affected by general economic and market conditions. If general economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty continues in the markets in which we do business, our clients might experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing which may impact the decisions of customers to purchase products that improve their processes and delay or reduce their purchases, and in our having higher customer receivables with increased default rates. General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and foreign economies may also cause customers to reduce their purchases, even if they have cash or if credit is available to them. This could result in reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. In addition, weakness in the end-user market could negatively affect our OEM and VAR customers who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations, which would increase our credit risk exposure and cause a decrease in operating cash flows. Also, if OEM and VAR customers experience excessive financial difficulties and/or insolvency, and we are unable to successfully transition end-users to purchase products from other vendors or directly from us, sales could decline. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIndex\nThe Financial Covenants in our Credit Agreement Dated April 29, 2014 (Credit Agreement), may Force Us to Take Certain Actions that Could Adversely Affect our Future Results of Operations.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a leverage ratio covenant and an interest coverage ratio covenant in future periods. Our ability to satisfy these financial covenants going forward will depend on our future operating performance, which is in part subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and various financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we cannot, or expect that we may not, meet the Credit Agreement\u2019s financial covenants in the future, we may need to dispose of material assets or operations, reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional equity capital investments or negotiate to restructure or refinance our indebtedness with our lenders. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if successful, such alternative measures may not allow us to meet the financial covenants in future periods, and/or they could limit our ability to realize the value of our assets and opportunities, restrict our ability to execute our long-term strategy or otherwise adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe have a Substantial Amount of Indebtedness, which could Impact our Ability to Obtain Future Financing or Pursue our Growth Strategy.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, our indebtedness principally consisted of a Term Loan of $229.1 million. In addition, we may incur additional amounts of debt under our existing credit facilities.\nOur high level of indebtedness could have important consequences and significant adverse effects on our business, including the following:\n\u00b7 We must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes;\n\u00b7 We must use a substantial portion of the proceeds of any asset sales to repay our indebtedness;\n\u00b7 Our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be limited;\n\u00b7 We are exposed to fluctuations in the interest rate environment because the interest rates under the Credit Facilities are variable;\n\u00b7 Our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u00b7 Our ability to pursue additional business opportunities may be limited; and\n\u00b7 Our high level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nThe Credit Agreement contains, and the instruments governing any indebtedness we may incur in the future may contain, restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that we believe may be in our best interest. The Credit Agreement, among other things, limits our ability to:\n\u00b7 Incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock;\n\u00b7 Create or incur liens;\n\u00b7 Enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u00b7 Make certain investments or certain other restricted payments or make certain capital expenditures or acquisitions;\n\u00b7 Merge or consolidate without meeting certain conditions;\n\u00b7 Sell assets;\n\u00b7 Pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or indebtedness;\n\u00b7 Enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u00b7 Guarantee indebtedness;\n\u00b7 Issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries.\nOur failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nPayments on our Indebtedness will Require a Significant Amount of Cash and our Ability to Service our Indebtedness is Impacted by Many Factors that are Outside of our Control.\nWe expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and to pay the amounts due under the Credit Agreement primarily from our operations. Our ability to meet our expenses and make these payments thus depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and our currently anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to service our indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement, meet the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have sufficient cash resources in the future, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing indebtedness, sell assets or borrow more money. We cannot be assured that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us or at all. See the section captioned \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in the Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may Incur Substantial Additional Indebtedness that could Further Exacerbate the Risks Associated with our Indebtedness.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Credit Agreement contains restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including additional secured indebtedness. In addition, we may refinance our existing indebtedness, which would permit us to incur additional indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, certain of the risks described above would intensify. Our ability to meet our cash requirements and service our indebtedness is impacted by many factors that are outside of our control.\nOur Failure to Comply with the Credit Agreement, Including as a Result of Events Beyond our Control, Could Result in an Event of Default.\nIf there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to the Credit Agreement, including as a result of our failure to meet the financial covenants included in the Credit Agreement with respect to our consolidated leverage ratio or our interest coverage ratio, we may not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the Credit Agreement and the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness.\nAn Increase in Interest Rates Would Increase the Cost of Servicing our Debt and Could Reduce our Profitability.\nThe Credit Agreement provides that borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate. While we are able to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes pursuant to the Credit Agreement through the use of hedging transactions, we will not completely eliminate the effect of interest rate changes. As a result, interest rate changes will not affect our obligation for any debt incurred under the Credit Agreement, but could affect the amount of our interest payments, and accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. An increase in interest rates, whether because of an increase in market interest rates or an increase in our own cost of borrowing, would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability.\nWe are required to pay regular dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (\"Preferred Stock\") issued to investment funds (the \u201cSeries A Investors\u201d) affiliated with Guggenheim Partners, LLC (\u201cGuggenheim\u201d), which ranks senior to our common stock, and we may be required under certain circumstances to repurchase the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; such obligations could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividend rights, and holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to cumulative dividends payable quarterly in cash at a rate of 8.5% per annum of the stated value of $1,000 per share. These regular cash dividends on our Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, commencing on March 31, 2015. In addition, the holders of our Preferred Stock have certain redemption rights, including upon certain change in control events involving us, which, if exercised, could require us to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at 100% or more of the stated value of the Preferred Stock, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. These redemption rights include a right to force us to redeem the Preferred Stock at any time prior to August 25, 2015 for an amount equal to 100% of the stated value of the Preferred Stock, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. If we are forced to redeem the Preferred Stock prior to August 25, 2015 and are unable to do so, the dividend rate on the Preferred Stock will increase at an additional rate of three percent for the first 180 days and an additional two percent for each additional 180 day period up to a maximum of fifteen and one half percent. In addition, the Credit Agreement places limitations on our ability to redeem the Preferred Stock using cash on hand and additional indebtedness, which may require us to issue additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock in order to fund such redemption.\nAny required redemption of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Redemptions could also result in significant dilution of our outstanding common stock. Our obligations to the holders of Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe issuance of 50,000 shares of our Preferred Stock to investment funds to the Series A Investors reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, may dilute the ownership of such holders, and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOn February 25, 2015, we issued 50,000 shares of Preferred Stock to investment funds affiliated with Guggenheim. The Series A Investors currently own all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, and based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of February 25, 2015, the Series A Investors collectively own Preferred Stock convertible into approximately 10.9% of our common stock (after giving effect to the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock). As holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our common stock holders, the issuance of the Preferred Stock to the Series A Investors has effectively reduced the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, conversion of the Preferred Stock to common stock will dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We have granted the Series A Investors registration rights in respect of the shares of Preferred Stock and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. These registration rights would facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales by the Series A Investors of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe Series A Investors may exercise significant influence over us, including through their ability to elect one of the members of our Board of Directors.\nAs of February 25, 2015, the shares of Preferred Stock owned by the Series A Investors represent approximately 10.9% of the voting rights of our common stock, on an as-converted basis, so the Series A Investors will have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders. In addition, the Certificate of Designations of the Preferred Stock and the investor rights agreement entered into in connection therewith grant certain consent rights to the holders of Preferred Stock in respect of certain actions by us, including the issuance of pari passu or senior equity securities of the company, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, any change in the size of our Board, the payment of certain distributions to our stockholders, and the incurrence of indebtedness that would have terms that are materially more restrictive than the Credit Agreement. The Series A Investors may have interests that diverge from, or even conflict with, those of our other stockholders. For example, Guggenheim and its affiliates may have an interest in directly or indirectly pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their other equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us. Guggenheim and its affiliates are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nIn addition, the purchase agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of the Preferred Stock (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) grants the Series A Investors certain rights to designate a director to serve on our Board. For so long as the Series A Investors and their permitted transferees beneficially own shares of Preferred Stock or the as-converted common stock purchased pursuant to the Purchase Agreement that represent more than 25% of the number of shares of the as-converted common stock purchased pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the majority Series A Investors will have the right to designate for nomination one director to our Board. In addition, we agreed to submit to our stockholders at our next annual meeting a shareholder proposal pursuant to which the holders of Preferred Stock would be permitted to elect a director directly.\nOur Performance Depends on our Ability to Attract and Retain Qualified Personnel.\nWe are dependent, in part, upon the services of our senior executives and other key business and technical personnel and competition for these types of highly skilled individuals is intense. We may not be able to retain existing key employees or be able to attract and retain skilled personnel on acceptable terms. We do not currently maintain key-man life insurance on our senior executives. If we are unable to fill any open positions with adequately qualified employees who are capable of quickly learning the responsibilities associated with their positions, or we fail to retain those employees, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nConcerns About our Financial Stability Could Adversely Affect our Sales.\nWe rely on sales of software (including upgrades) and maintenance agreements for a significant portion of our revenue. Many of the customers in our industry expect to utilize software and services over a period of years and require access to upgrades and maintenance services during that time period. To the extent our customers have doubts about our financial stability and our ability to continue to operate as a going concern, those customers may seek alternative solutions from competitors who those customers believe to be more financially stable. If our customers shift their business to our competitors who appear to be more financially stable, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIndex\nInadequate Liquidity Could Limit our Ability to Meet our Obligations and could Materially Adversely Affect our Business Operations in the Future.\nWe require substantial liquidity to make interest and principal payments on our indebtedness and run our normal business operations. Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our cash flow and liquidity position in the future, including the other risks discussed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future is dependent upon our ability to manage business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such indebtedness and may be limited or available only on disadvantageous terms. Unless we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations, we may require additional borrowings or the sale of debt or equity securities, sale of non-strategic assets, or some combination thereof, to provide funding for our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient working capital or obtain alternative financing, we may not be able to borrow or otherwise obtain additional funds to finance our operations when needed, our financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected. In addition to generating sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations, we must generate sufficient liquidity to fund our business plan. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms when necessary, we may not be able to develop or enhance products and services, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements and funding our plan. Any such failure to raise funds on acceptable terms could weaken our competitive position and materially adversely affect our business.\nHealthcare Industry Consolidation could Impose Pressure on our Software Prices, Reduce our Potential Client Base and Reduce Demand for our Software.\nMany hospitals and imaging centers have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market and purchasing power. If this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the size of our potential customer base and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining or purchasing power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our software or decreased margins for our products. In addition, when hospitals and imaging centers combine, they often consolidate infrastructure, and consolidation of our customers could result in fewer overall customers and erode our revenue base.\nWe may Fail to Achieve our Financial Forecasts due to Inaccurate Sales Forecasts, Delays in Sales and Installation of our Products and Other Reasons.\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue which may decrease or fluctuate significantly. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued demand for our products and services offered through us or our OEM and VAR customers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. We base expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates, which are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and signed customer contracts, which may be cancelable or subject to modification. As a result, our revenues are difficult to forecast, and our operating results can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter. Because a significant portion of our cost structure, including expenses and investments, are fixed in the short-term, if revenues are lower than expected we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough and as such we may experience a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability.\nDelays in the expected sales or installation of our software may have a significant impact on our anticipated quarterly revenues and, because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed, our expenses may not align with our revenue. Additionally, we sometimes depend, in part, upon large contracts with a limited number of significant customers to meet projected sales goals in any particular quarter. Delays in the expected sales or installation of solutions under these large contracts may have a significant impact on our quarterly net sales and consequently our earnings.\nThe Length of our Sales and Implementation Cycles may Adversely Affect our Operating Results.\nWe have experienced long sales and implementation cycles. How and when to implement, replace, expand or substantially modify medical imaging management software, or to modify or add business processes, are major decisions for our end-user target market. The sales cycle for our software ranges from six to 18 months or more from initial contact to contract execution. Our end-user implementation cycle has generally ranged from three to nine months from contract execution to completion of implementation. During the sales and implementation cycles, we will expend substantial time, effort and resources preparing contract proposals, negotiating the contract and implementing the software, and may not realize any revenues to offset these expenditures. Additionally, any decision by our customers to delay or cancel purchases or the implementation of our software may adversely affect net sales.\nIndex\nWe Operate in Competitive Markets, which may Adversely Affect our Market Share and Financial Results.\nThe markets for Healthcare IT solutions are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We may be unable to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. Some of our competitors are focused on sub-markets within targeted industries, while others have significant financial and information-gathering resources with recognized brands, technological expertise and market experience. We believe that competitors are continuously enhancing their products and services, developing new products and services and investing in technology to better serve the needs of their existing customers and to attract new customers. In addition, new competitors may emerge and our system and software solution offerings may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of our solutions.\nWe face competition in specific industries and with respect to specific offerings. We may also face competition from organizations and businesses that have not traditionally competed with us, but that could adapt their products and services to meet the demands of our customers. In addition, we often compete with our OEM customers\u2019 own internal software engineering groups. The size and competency of these groups may create additional competition. Increased competition may require us to reduce the prices of our offerings or make additional capital investments that would adversely affect margins. If we are unable or unwilling to do so, we may lose market share in target markets and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nIf We Are Unable to Successfully Identify or Effectively Integrate Acquisitions, our Financial Results may be Adversely Affected.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire and make investments in companies, products or technologies that we believe complement or expand our existing business and assist in quickly bringing new products to market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisitions at acceptable valuations. In addition, our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from past and future acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the offerings, technology, administrative functions, and personnel of these businesses into our business in an efficient and effective manner. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses or that our acquired businesses will perform at anticipated levels. In addition, our past and future acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities, or disrupt operations and divert management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations. In addition, we may use our capital stock to acquire acquisition targets, which could be dilutive to the existing stockholders and cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nIn making or attempting to make acquisitions or investments, we face a number of risks, including risks related to:\n\u00b7 Identifying suitable candidates, performing appropriate due diligence, identifying potential liabilities and negotiating acceptable terms;\n\u00b7 The potential distraction of our management, diversion of our resources and disruption to our business;\n\u00b7 Retaining and motivating key employees of the acquired companies;\n\u00b7 Managing operations that are distant from our current headquarters and operational locations;\n\u00b7 Entering into industries or geographic markets in which we have little or no prior experience;\n\u00b7 Competing for acquisition opportunities with competitors that are larger or have greater financial and other resources than us;\n\u00b7 Accurately forecasting the financial impact of a transaction;\n\u00b7 Assuming liabilities of acquired companies, including existing or potential litigation related to the operation of the business prior to the acquisition;\n\u00b7 Reducing our working capital and hindering our ability to expand or maintain our business, if acquisitions are made using cash;\n\u00b7 Maintaining good relations with the customers and suppliers of the acquired company; and\n\u00b7 Effectively integrating acquired companies and achieving expected synergies.\nIn addition, any acquired business, products or technologies may not generate sufficient revenue and net income to offset the associated costs of such acquisitions, and such acquisitions could result in other adverse effects. In the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred $0.2 million, $0.9 million, and $3.4 million of acquisition related costs, respectively. All such direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred by us. In addition, we often are required to incur charges to operations in the quarters following an acquisition to reflect costs associated with integrating acquired companies. We anticipate that our acquisition activities will require cash outflows directly related to completing acquisitions as well as costs related to integration efforts. If the benefits of an acquisition do not exceed the costs of integrating the businesses, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nIndex\nMoreover, from time to time, we may enter into negotiations for the acquisition of businesses, products or technologies but be unable or unwilling to consummate the acquisitions under consideration. This can be expensive and could cause significant diversion of managerial attention and resources.\nA Portion of our Business Relies Upon a Network of Independent Contractors and Distributors Whose Actions could have an Adverse Effect on our Business.\nWe obtain some critical services from independent contractors. In addition, we rely on a network of VARs and distributors to sell our offerings in locations where we do not maintain a sales office or direct sales team. These independent contractors, VARs and distributors are not our employees. As a result, we have limited ability to monitor and direct their activities. The loss of a significant number of these independent contractors, VARs or distributors could disrupt our sales, marketing and distribution efforts and we may not be able to obtain or utilize on favorable terms, or at all, replacement licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing services under commercial agreements. Furthermore, if any actions or business practices of these individuals or entities violate our policies or procedures, or laws or regulations to which we are subject, we could be subject to litigation, regulatory sanctions or reputation damage, any of which could adversely affect our business and require us to terminate relationships with them.\nOur Investments in Technology may not be Sufficient and may not Result in an Increase in our Revenues or Decrease in our Operating Costs.\nAs the technological landscape continues to evolve, it may become increasingly difficult for us to make timely, cost-effective changes to our product offerings to allow us to effectively compete against our competitors\u2019 product offerings. In order to effectively market our products, we require constant innovation, which requires investments in research and development, among other things. We cannot provide any assurance that our investments will result in successful applications that will be sufficient to maintain or improve our competitive position.\nIf our New and Existing Products, Including Product Upgrades and Services do not Achieve and Maintain Sufficient Market Acceptance, our Business, Financial Condition, Cash Flows, Revenues, and Operating Results could Suffer.\nThe success of our business depends and will continue to depend in large part on the market acceptance of:\n\u00b7 Our existing products and services;\n\u00b7 Our new products and services; and\n\u00b7 Enhancements to existing products support and services.\nThere can be no assurance that customers will accept any of these products, product upgrades, support or services. In addition, even if customers accept these products and services initially, we cannot be assured that they will continue to purchase our products and services at levels that are consistent with, or higher than, past quarters. Customers may significantly reduce their relationships with us or choose not to expand their relationship with us. In addition, any pricing strategy that we implement for any of our products, product upgrades, or services may not be economically viable or acceptable to our target markets. Failure to achieve or to sustain significant penetration in our target markets with respect to any of these products, product upgrades, or services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAchieving and sustaining market acceptance for these products, product upgrades and services is likely to require substantial marketing and service efforts and the expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry. In addition, deployment of new or newly integrated products or product upgrades may require the use of additional resources for training our existing sales force and customer service personnel and for hiring and training additional sales and customer service personnel. There can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities for new products, product upgrades and services will justify the amounts that we spend for their development, marketing and rollout.\nIf we are unable to sell new and next-generation software products to healthcare providers that are in the market for healthcare information and/or image management systems, such inability will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenues and operating results. If anticipated software sales and services do not materialize, or if we lose customers or experience significant declines in orders from customers, our revenues would decrease over time due to the combined effects of attrition of existing customers and a shortfall in new client additions.\nIndex\nWe may not be Able to Adequately Protect our Intellectual Property Rights or may be Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties.\nWe regard our intellectual property as important to our success. We have a portfolio of U.S. and international patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and trade secrets covering our products and services. Our proprietary technology is not dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. Our business is not dependent on any single patent, copyright or other form of intellectual property. We believe the term of each of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. We rely on trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret law, and utilize confidentiality, license and other agreements with employees, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights.\nWe hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally, and in some cases, utilized in our products or services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our operations and products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party.\nWe may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of these rights. Any claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. If we are found liable of infringement, we may be required to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products. We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed on their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nWe also rely on proprietary know how and confidential information and employ various methods, such as entering into confidentiality and non-compete agreements with our current employees and with certain third parties to whom we have divulged proprietary information to protect the processes, concepts, ideas and documentation associated with our solutions. Such methods may not afford sufficient protection, and we may not be able to protect trade secrets adequately or ensure that other companies would not acquire information that we consider proprietary, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive harm that could adversely affect our business.\nChanges in Foreign Exchange Rates may Impact our Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nOur international operating results are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. While the functional currency of most of our international operations is the U.S. Dollar, we conduct transactions in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, and certain account balances in foreign countries are maintained in the local currency. As such, changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar can affect our revenues, operating results and the value of our foreign currency account balances. Generally, our revenues, operating results and foreign currency account balances are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. As we expand international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations may increase.\nWe may not be Successful in our Efforts to Expand into International Markets.\nOur international activities are material to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In 2014, our international revenues were $14 million, or about 7% of total revenues. We have limited experience operating in international markets and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed in developing products to meet demand in new markets. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 Local economic and political conditions;\n\u00b7 Foreign government regulation of healthcare and government reimbursement of health services;\n\u00b7 Local restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products and services;\n\u00b7 Local import, export or other business licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 Local limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\nIndex\n\u00b7 Shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\n\u00b7 Local laws and regulations regarding data protection, privacy, network security and restrictions on pricing;\n\u00b7 Difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u00b7 Different employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers\u2019 councils and labor unions;\n\u00b7 Laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans and taxes; and\n\u00b7 Geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.\nLitigation or Regulatory Actions could Adversely Affect our Financial Condition.\nAs a result of lawsuits and regulatory matters, including the matters discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial expenses. In addition, we are, from time to time, parties to legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and other claims incident to our business activities. Such matters may include, among other things, assertions of contract breach or intellectual property infringement, claims for indemnity arising in the course of our business and claims by persons whose employment has been terminated. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable. The defense of these actions may be both time consuming and expensive. We are unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability, amounts which may be covered by insurance or recoverable from third parties, or the financial impact with respect to these matters as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of these legal proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe may be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Property are Harmed by the Products and Services that we Sell.\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions. Moreover, because our products are intended to be used in connection with providing medical care to patients, users of our products may have a greater sensitivity to errors than in the general market for software products. If our products lead to faulty medical decisions or injury to patients, we could be exposed to claims or litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business. Certain third parties, primarily our customers, also sell products or services using our products. This may increase our exposure to product liability claims. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available on economically reasonable terms or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with vendors do not indemnify us from product liability. Even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe Provide Customers with Certain Warranties that could Result in Higher Costs than Anticipated.\nSoftware products such as ours that are used in a wide range of clinical and health information system settings may contain a number of errors or \u201cbugs,\u201d especially early in their product life cycle. Our products include clinical information systems used in patient care settings where a low tolerance for errors or bugs exists. Testing of products is difficult due to the wide range of environments in which systems are installed. The discovery of defects or errors in our software products or in our implementation of integrated solutions may cause delays in product delivery, poor client references, payment disputes, contract cancellations, harm to our reputation, product liability claims or additional expenses and payments to rectify problems. Furthermore, our customers might use our software together with products from other companies or those that they have developed internally. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our software does not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our research and development efforts; impact our reputation and cause significant customer relations problems. Any of those factors may result in delayed acceptance of, or the return of, our software products.\nWe Depend on Licenses from Third Parties for Rights to Some Technology we use, and if we are Unable to Continue these Relationships and Maintain our Rights to this Technology, our Business could Suffer.\nSome of the technology used in our software depends upon licenses from third party vendors. These licenses typically expire within one to five years, can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time. We may not be able to continue using the technology made available to us under these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As a result, we may have to discontinue, delay or reduce software shipments until we obtain equivalent technology, if available, which could hurt our business. Most of our third party licenses are nonexclusive. Our competitors may obtain the same right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with us. In addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future or are unsuccessful in their continued research and development efforts, particularly with regard to the Microsoft Windows/Intel platform on which most of our products operate, we may not be able to modify or adapt our own software. This could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIndex\nOur Large Stockholders may have Interests that Differ from other Stockholders.\nMerrick Ventures, LLC (Merrick Ventures) and its affiliates, including Merrick Venture Management Holdings, LLC (Merrick Holdings), beneficially own, as of December 31, 2014, 26.9% of our outstanding common stock. Michael W. Ferro, Jr., our Chairman of the Board, and trusts for the benefit of Mr. Ferro\u2019s family members beneficially own a majority of the equity interests in Merrick Ventures and Merrick Holdings. Mr. Ferro also serves as the chairman and chief executive officer of Merrick Ventures and Merrick Holdings. Accordingly, Mr. Ferro indirectly owns or controls all of the shares of our common stock owned by Merrick Ventures and Merrick Holdings. Due to their stock ownership, Merrick Ventures and Merrick Holdings have significant influence over our business, including the election of our directors.\nThe interests of Merrick Ventures, Merrick Holdings and their affiliates may differ from those of our other stockholders. Merrick Ventures, Merrick Holdings and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and maximizing the return on those investments. They currently have, and may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain aspects of our business or that supply us with goods and services. Merrick Ventures, Merrick Holdings and their affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Merrick Ventures\u2019 and Merrick Holdings\u2019 significant ownership of our voting stock will enable it to influence or effectively control us and the influence of our large stockholders could impact our business strategy and also have the effect of discouraging others from purchasing or attempting to take a control position in our common stock, thereby increasing the likelihood that the market price of our common stock will not reflect a premium for control.\nShares of our Common Stock Eligible for Public Sale may have a Negative Impact on the Market Price of our Common Stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital, should we wish to do so, through the sale of additional common or preferred stock. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 98.4 million shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding options to purchase approximately 6.0 million shares of our common stock. Future sales of shares of our common stock by existing holders of our common stock or by holders of outstanding options, upon the exercise thereof, could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock. As additional shares of common stock become available for sale in the public market, due to the exercise of options or the issuance of shares as a result of acquisitions, the market supply of shares of common stock will increase, which could also decrease the market price.\nWe are unable to estimate the number of shares that may be sold because this will depend on the market price for our common stock, the personal circumstances of the sellers and other factors. Any sale of substantial amounts of our common stock or other securities in the open market may adversely affect the market price of such securities and may adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing in the capital markets as well as create a potential market overhang.\nBecause we do not Intend to Pay Cash Dividends, Stockholders will Benefit from an Investment in our Stock Only if it Appreciates in Value.\nWe currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund future growth, and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased and will purchase shares.\nThe Trading Price of our Common Stock has been Volatile and may Fluctuate Substantially in the Future.\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. The trading price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, some of which are not in our control, including:\n\u00b7 Our ability to meet or exceed the expectations of analysts or investors;\n\u00b7 Changes in our forecasts or earnings estimates by analysts;\nIndex\n\u00b7 Quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 Announcements regarding clinical activities or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 General conditions in the healthcare IT industry;\n\u00b7 Governmental regulatory action and healthcare reform measures, including changes in reimbursement rates for imaging procedures;\n\u00b7 Rumors about our performance or software solutions;\n\u00b7 Announcements regarding acquisitions;\n\u00b7 Uncertainty regarding our ability to service existing debt;\n\u00b7 Price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, which have particularly affected the market prices of many software, healthcare and technology companies; and\n\u00b7 General economic conditions.\nIn addition, the market for our common stock may experience price and volume fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These fluctuations could have a significant impact on our business due to diminished incentives for management and diminished currency for acquisitions.\nIf our Operating and Financial Performance Does not Meet the Guidance that we Have Provided to the Public, our Stock Price may Decline.\nPeriodically, we provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our stockholders and potential stockholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the guidance we have provided, especially in times of economic uncertainty. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nCertain Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law could make a Takeover Difficult and May Prevent or Frustrate Attempts by our Stockholders to Replace or Remove our Management Team.\nVarious provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage some transactions involving an actual or potential change in control and may limit the ability of our stockholders to remove current management or approve transactions that our stockholders may deem to be in their best interests. For instance, we have an authorized class of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock all of which shares are undesignated except for 50,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (none of which were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and 2013). Shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock may be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval, on such terms and with such rights, preferences and designation as the board of directors may determine. Issuance of such preferred stock, depending upon the rights, preferences and designations thereof, may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control.\nIn addition, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u00b7 Require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing;\n\u00b7 Provide an advance written notice procedure with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our board of directors or a committee of our board of directors;\n\u00b7 State that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or by a majority of our board of directors then in office; and\n\u00b7 Allow our directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors, including vacancies resulting from removal or enlargement of the board of directors.\nWe are also subject to provisions of Delaware corporate law which, subject to certain exceptions, will prohibit us from engaging in any \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns 15% or more of our common stock for a period of three years following the date that the person came to own 15% or more of our common stock, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nIndex\nThese provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and of Delaware law, may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control, may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price and may adversely affect the market price, and the voting and other rights of the holders, of our common stock. In addition, these provisions make it more difficult to replace or remove our current management team in the event our stockholders believe this would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders.\nSome of our Activities may Subject us to Risks under Laws and Regulations relating to Healthcare Fraud.\nWe are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse, and the government, both state and federal, continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Our relationships with hospitals and imaging centers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under Medicare and Medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become liable for damages, suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.\nOur Failure to Comply with Evolving Interoperability Standards could Depress the Demand for our Software and Impose Significant Software Redesign Costs.\nThere is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other. This need for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups, and certain federal and state agencies are also developing standards that could become mandatory for systems purchased by these agencies. For example, the HITECH Act requires meaningful use of \u201ccertified\u201d healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government. Effective September 27, 2010, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) issued a rule that utilizes a staged approach for defining meaningful use criteria. Under the staged approach, CMS has issued rules that identify the initial criteria for meaningful use and is updating these initial criteria with additional rules. On September 4, 2012, CMS published a final rule that specifies the Stage 2 criteria that eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals must meet in order to continue to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record Incentive Programs. All providers must achieve meaningful use under the Stage 1 criteria before moving to Stage 2. In addition, these standards are subject to interpretation by the entities designed to certify such technology. A combination of our solutions has been certified as meeting the initial criteria. However, we may incur increased development costs and delays in upgrading our customer software and systems to be in compliance with these varying and evolving standards. In addition, these new standards may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. To the extent these standards are narrowly construed or delayed in publication, or that we are delayed in achieving certification under these evolving standards for applicable products, our customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement our software and systems. For example, the 2014 Meaningful Use program included changes, proposed in July and finalized in October, which allowed providers to report using older technology. This significantly impacted upgrades, as our customers could use older versions of our product and still stay compliant with the program. Currently, CMS has issued a proposal to change the reporting period in 2015 from a full year to 90 days. We anticipate that this could further delay upgrades.\nIn addition to national programs like Meaningful Use, state laws and subsequent change can impact development costs on our products. Some examples include varying state laws on radiation dosage tracking and the reporting of breast density in mammography tracking. Both state and national regulations are becoming increasingly focused on health IT, and it has caused roadmap changes for our products.\nWith regard to interoperability, the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) has published an interoperability roadmap titled Connecting Health and Care for the Nation: A 10-year vision to Achieve Interoperable Health IT Infrastructure first published in June 2014 and updated in October 2014, which will impact virtually all of our products if implemented. It contains both standards for clinical data definitions and standards for the mechanisms of moving such data among providers and patients.\nIndex", "PERMNO": 85739, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "MRGE.1"}
