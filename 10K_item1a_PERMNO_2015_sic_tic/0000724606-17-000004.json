{"cik": "724606", "company": "PANERA BREAD CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors could materially affect our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic and industry conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material also may impair our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in our bakery-cafe supply chain could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.\nOur Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes depend on frequent deliveries of ingredients and other products. We rely on one distribution partner to deliver the majority of our non-dough ingredients and other products to our bakery-cafes two or three times per week, and we supply our bakery-cafes with fresh dough and certain other products, including produce, on a daily basis. There are many factors which could cause shortages or interruptions in the supply of our ingredients and products, including adverse weather, unanticipated demand, labor or distribution problems, food safety issues by our suppliers or distributors, cost, and the financial health of our suppliers. Additionally, we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for several of our proteins, such as selected proteins raised without antibiotics, which are sold in most Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes. Due to our dependence on a limited number of suppliers, it may be difficult or more costly for us to find alternative suppliers, if necessary. If we have to seek new suppliers or service providers, we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy. If we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time, this could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our bakery-cafes, which could cause a bakery-cafe to remove items from its menu. If such actions were to occur, customers could change their dining habits and affected bakery-cafes could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter.\nThe market in which we compete is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to location, customer service, price, value, food quality, ambiance, and overall customer experience. We compete with national, regional, and locally owned food service companies, including specialty food, casual dining and quick-service restaurants, coffee chains, bakeries, and restaurant retailers. Many of our competitors or potential competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing, marketing, and trends in the restaurant industry more quickly or effectively than we can.\nWe may also compete with companies outside the fast casual and quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry. For example, competitive pressures can come from deli sections and in-store caf\u00e9s of several major grocery store chains, including those targeted at customers who want higher-quality food. These competitors may have, among other things, a more diverse menu, lower operating costs, better locations, facilities or management, more effective marketing or more efficient operations than we have. Finally, as we implement new initiatives and expand our offerings we will compete with companies with longer track records and more experience in food service segments. For example, as we expand our small-order delivery strategy, we will compete with businesses in the highly competitive pizza delivery marketplace and with providers who offer ordering and meal delivery services from unaffiliated restaurants.\nIf we are unable to successfully compete in these markets, we may be unable to sustain or increase our revenues and profitability.\nChanges in customer tastes and preferences may reduce the frequency of their visits to our bakery-cafes or may cause them to cease paying our prices for high-quality food.\nOur success depends in large part on our customers' continued belief that food made with high-quality ingredients, including selected proteins raised without antibiotics, our artisan breads, and food items made without artificial preservatives, flavors, sweeteners or colors from artificial sources is worth the prices charged at our bakery-cafes relative to the lower prices offered by some of our competitors, particularly those in the quick-service segment. Our inability to successfully educate customers about the quality of our food or our customers\u2019 rejection of our pricing approach could result in decreased demand for our products or require us to change our pricing, marketing, or promotional strategies, which could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial results or the brand identity that we have created.\nDamage to our brands or reputation could negatively impact our business.\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brands and our reputation for offering high-quality food and a memorable experience with superior customer service. Our brands have been highly rated in annual consumer surveys and have received high recognition in industry publications. We believe that we must protect and grow the value of our brands through our Concept Essence to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and continue our success. Any incident that erodes consumer trust in or affinity for our brands could significantly reduce their value and have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in food and supply costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. In the past, we have generally been able to recover inflationary cost and commodity price increases for, among other things, fuel, proteins, dairy, produce, wheat, tuna, and cream cheese through increased menu prices. There have been, and there may be in the future, delays in implementing such menu price increases, and economic factors and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover fully such cost increases. Historically, the effects of inflation on our consolidated results of operations have not been materially adverse. However, increased volatility in certain commodity markets, including those for wheat, proteins, or produce, could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations if we are unable to increase menu prices to cover such ingredient price increases. We could also be adversely affected by price increases specific to proteins we have chosen due to their specific quality profile or related criteria (e.g. proteins raised without antibiotics), the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for other commodity food products.\nWe may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives, which may have an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial results.\nOur business depends upon our ability to continue to grow and evolve through various important strategic initiatives. There can be no assurance that we will be able to implement these important strategic initiatives or that these strategic initiatives will deliver on their intended results, which could in turn adversely affect our business.\nThese strategic initiatives include:\n\u2022\ngenerating increased sales through catering and small-order delivery through our Panera to You\u00ae initiatives;\n\u2022\nintroducing new menu items and improving existing items consistent with customer tastes and expectations and our commitment to food that customers can trust through our food policy initiatives;\n\u2022\nbalancing unit growth while meeting target returns on invested capital for locations;\n\u2022\ngenerating additional revenue and corresponding profits through the retail sale of consumer packaged goods through alternative channels of distribution;\n\u2022\nidentifying alternative formats for our bakery-cafes to enable us to open locations in more diverse locations;\n\u2022\ninvesting in technology and systems designed to enable our managers to focus their energy on improving the customer experience in our bakery-cafes;\n\u2022\nincreasing brand awareness through greater investment in marketing and advertising, including increased national television advertising and digital advertising and continued leveraging of our MyPanera\u00ae loyalty program;\n\u2022\ninvesting in labor and the related management tools to meet the demands necessary to maximize throughput and capacity in our bakery-cafes;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising initiative, which will depend on various factors including the returns we realize from such transactions and whether the resulting ownership mix supports our financial objectives;\n\u2022\nsimplifying our operating procedures to facilitate the operation of high volume bakery-cafes; and\n\u2022\ninvesting in technology designed to drive demand and increase transaction counts and frequency in our bakery-cafes.\nCustomer preferences and traffic could be adversely impacted by health concerns about certain food products, reports of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues, any of which could result in a decrease in demand for our products.\nCustomer preferences and traffic could be adversely impacted by health concerns or negative publicity about the consumption of particular food products, which could cause a decline in demand for those products and adversely impact our sales.\nInstances or reports, whether verified or not, of food-safety issues, such as food-borne illnesses, food tampering, food contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing, grocery and quick service and fast casual restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. Any report linking us to food-borne illnesses or food tampering, contamination, mislabeling or other food-safety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or damages.\nThese problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as norovirus or hepatitis A), and injuries caused by the presence of foreign material have in the past, and could in the future, require us to temporarily close bakery-cafes. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and a decrease in customer traffic to our bakery-cafes. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination, whether or not at our bakery-cafes, could subject us or our suppliers to a food recall pursuant to the United States Food and Drug Administration's recently enacted Food Safety Modernization Act.\nOur financial results could be negatively impacted if we fail to generate expected revenue and profits from substantial investments in our bakery-cafes to enable a better customer experience.\nOperational excellence and the continued improvement of our customer experience are among our highest priorities and as such we have made significant investments in our bakery-cafes over the past several years. We expect to continue to make investments during the fiscal year ended December 26, 2017, or fiscal 2017, and going forward in technology, operational tools, and related systems, as well as the labor necessary to support this technology, in areas which include, but are not limited to, the ordering process, food production and delivery of food to the customer, both inside the bakery-cafe and directly to customers at their home or business. Our inability to accurately predict the costs and rollout of such initiatives across our system or our failure to generate expected revenue and profits from such activities and investments could negatively impact our financial results.\nThe unauthorized access, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of our proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could adversely affect our business.\nEach year, we engage in millions of transactions with our customers. Approximately 78 percent of our bakery-cafe sales are by credit or debit card. Additionally, as we continue to evolve our e-commerce initiatives we expect our credit card transactions, specifically online and mobile, to continue to increase. In connection with credit card sales, including online and through mobile applications, we and our franchisees transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. As a result, our information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers. Although we use private networks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit card sales; we and our franchisees' security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If a third party is able to circumvent these security measures, information could be stolen or destroyed, potentially causing a disruption of our operations. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems. Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third party business partners or service providers, regardless if a breach has been attempted or has occurred, can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business.\nLike many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology systems, none of which have resulted in a material breach. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. While we continue to make significant investment in physical and technological security measures, employee training, and third party services, designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and prevent breaches, our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our third party vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, shutdowns, or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct, employee error or malfeasance, utility failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Due to these scenarios we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\nWe also maintain private information through our administrative functions, including human resources, payroll, accounting and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers. If a third party is able to circumvent the security measures intended by us or our vendors to protect this data, he or she could destroy or steal information or disrupt our operations, which could significantly harm our reputation and/or result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.\nDisruptions or supply issues in our fresh dough facilities could adversely affect our business and consolidated results of operations.\nWe operate 22 Company-owned fresh dough facilities, which service substantially all of our Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes. Our fresh dough and other product distribution system delivers fresh dough and other products daily to the bakery-cafes through a leased fleet of temperature controlled vehicles. The optimal maximum distribution range is approximately 300 miles; although, when necessary, the distribution range may reach up to 500 miles. As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of, or distribution from any of our fresh dough facilities, including due to weather conditions, technical or labor difficulties, food safety concerns, or destruction of, or damage to the vehicle fleet or facilities, could result in a shortage of fresh dough and other products at our bakery-cafes, and, depending on its extent and duration, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.\nAdditionally, given that we rely on trucks for the delivery of items from our fresh dough facilities, any increased costs and distribution issues related to fuel could also materially adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\nOur Franklin, Massachusetts fresh dough facility manufactures and supplies through its distributors all of the cream cheese and tuna used in most of our Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes in the United States. Additionally, we distribute a number of fresh produce products provided from our suppliers through our fresh dough facility system. Although we believe we have adopted adequate quality assurance and other procedures to seek to ensure the production and distribution of quality products and ingredients, we may experience concerns, including allegations regarding quality, health, or other similar concerns\nthat could have a negative impact on our operations, whether or not the allegations are valid or we are liable. Additionally, defending against such claims or litigation could be costly and the results uncertain.\nIf we are not successful in our initiatives related to delivering food customers can trust, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur commitment to serve food that customers can trust represents an important part of our business. We currently use a significant number of ingredients raised or manufactured with an emphasis on practices we believe to be more responsible than some conventional practices, such as selected proteins raised without antibiotics and with a concern for animal welfare generally. We may encounter supply challenges for such ingredients, particularly proteins. We have also removed all artificial additives on our \"No No List\" from our food in all of our bakery-cafes in the United States as of the beginning of 2017. This commitment will increase our costs.\nIf, as a result of any of these factors, we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of such ingredients on a cost-effective basis, our food costs could increase, which could adversely affect our operating margins. We may also face adverse publicity or liability for false advertising claims if there is not adherence to all of the elements of our food policy and related initiatives, such as responsible animal welfare policies and similar criteria on which we base our purchasing decisions. A few of our markets temporarily served conventionally raised turkey for a brief period during fiscal 2014 due to supply shortages. These factors could also make it difficult to align our food policy initiatives, which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline. If any such supplier failures occur and are publicized, our reputation would be harmed and our sales may be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, in response to increasing customer awareness and demand, some competitors have also begun to advertise their use of meats raised without the use of antibiotics and other ingredients similar to those we seek as part of our food policy and initiatives. If competitors become known for using these types of higher-quality or more sustainable ingredients, it could further limit our supply of these ingredients, and may make it more difficult for us to differentiate ourselves which could adversely impact our operating results.\nIncreased advertising and marketing costs could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe expect our advertising expenses to continue to increase and we intend to continue to dedicate resources to national advertising and marketing in the future. If new advertising and other marketing programs, including our digital advertising or national television advertising, do not result in increased net bakery-cafe sales or if the costs of advertising, media, or marketing increase greater than expected, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreased labor costs or difficulties in recruiting the right associates could adversely affect our future results.\nOur success depends, in part, on our continuing ability to hire, train, motivate, and retain qualified associates in our bakery-cafes, fresh dough facilities, and support centers in a competitive labor market. We look to hire warm, friendly, motivated and caring associates, who are excited and committed to embodying our culture and actively growing themselves and our brand. A sufficient number of qualified individuals to fill these positions and qualifications may be in short supply in some communities. Competition in these communities for qualified staff could require us to pay higher wages and provide greater benefits, especially if there is significant improvement in regional or national economic conditions. We place a heavy emphasis on the qualification and training of our personnel and spend a significant amount of time and money on training our employees. Any inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may result in higher turnover and increased labor costs, and could compromise the quality of our service, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected if we are unable to execute our bakery-cafe growth strategy or achieve sufficient returns on invested capital in bakery-cafe locations.\nOur bakery-cafe growth strategy primarily consists of new market development and further penetration of existing markets, both by us and our franchisees, including the selection of sites which will achieve targeted returns on invested capital. The success of this strategy depends on numerous factors that are not completely controlled by us or involve risks that may impact the development, or timing of development, of our bakery-cafes. Our ability to grow the number of bakery-cafes successfully will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nobstacles to hiring and training qualified operating personnel in the local market;\n\u2022\nidentification and availability of suitable locations for new bakery-cafes on acceptable terms, including costs and appropriate delivery distances from our fresh dough facilities;\n\u2022\nincreased competition for restaurant sites from newer and increasing number of concepts in the fast casual segment;\n\u2022\nvariations in the number and timing of bakery-cafe openings as compared to our construction schedule;\n\u2022\nmanagement of the costs of construction of bakery-cafes, particularly due to factors outside our control, such as the timing of delivery of a leased location by the landlord;\n\u2022\nour ability to negotiate favorable economic and business terms;\n\u2022\nour ability to secure required governmental approvals and permits and comply with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations; and\n\u2022\nshortages of construction materials and labor.\nOur bakery-cafe growth strategy also includes continued development of bakery-cafes through franchising. As of December 27, 2016, approximately 56 percent of our bakery-cafes were operated by franchisees (1,134 franchise-operated bakery-cafes out of a total of 2,036 bakery-cafes system-wide). The opening and successful operation of bakery-cafes by franchisees depends on a number of factors, including those identified above, as well as the availability of suitable franchise candidates and the financial and other resources of our franchisees such as our franchisees\u2019 ability to receive financing from banks and other financial institutions, which may become more challenging in the current economic environment.\nAs noted above, identifying and securing an adequate supply of suitable new bakery-cafe sites presents significant challenges because of the intense competition for those sites in our target markets, and increasing development and leasing costs. This may be especially true as we continue to expand into more urban locations. Further, any restrictions or limitations of credit markets may require developers to delay or be unable to finance new projects. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results.\nOur success in part depends on the success of our franchisees business.\nOur success depends in part on the operations of our franchisees. While we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, our franchisees, the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial pressures and their own business operations, such as employment related matters. We strive to provide our customers with the same experience at Company-owned bakery-cafes and franchise-operated bakery-cafes. Our customers may attribute to us problems which originate with one of our franchisees, particularly those affecting the quality of the service experience, food safety, litigation or compliance with laws and regulations, thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially adversely affecting our results of operations.\nFurthermore, our consolidated results of operations include revenues derived from royalties on sales from, and revenues from sales by our fresh dough facilities to, franchise-operated bakery-cafes. As a result, our growth expectations and revenues could be negatively impacted by a material downturn in sales at and to franchise-operated bakery-cafes or if one or more key franchisees becomes insolvent and unable to pay us royalties.\nEconomic conditions in the United States and globally could adversely affect our business and financial results and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources as well as that of our suppliers.\nAs our business depends upon consumer discretionary spending, our financial results are sensitive to broader macroeconomic conditions. Our customers may make fewer discretionary purchases as a result of, for example, unemployment, increased fuel and energy costs, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit and falling home prices. Because a key point in our business strategy is maintaining our transaction counts, average check amount and margin growth, any significant decrease in customer traffic or average profit per transaction resulting from fewer purchases by our customers or our customers' preferences to trade down to lower priced products on our menu will negatively impact our financial performance. If negative economic conditions persist for an extended period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis. Additionally, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers could result in product delays or shortages.\nLoss of senior management could adversely affect our future success.\nOur success depends on the services of our senior management, all of whom are \u201cat will\u201d employees. The loss of a member of senior management could have an adverse impact on our business or the financial market\u2019s perception of our ability to continue to grow.\nIf we fail to comply with governmental laws or regulations or if these laws or regulations change, our business could suffer.\nIn connection with the operation of our business, we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations that are complex and vary from location to location, including those related to:\n\u2022\nfranchise relationships;\n\u2022\nbuilding construction and zoning requirements;\n\u2022\nnutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements;\n\u2022\nmanagement and protection of the personal data of our employees and customers; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental matters.\nOur bakery-cafes and fresh dough facilities are licensed and subject to regulation under federal, state, local and foreign laws, including business, health, fire, and safety codes. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas.\nIn addition, various federal, state, local and foreign labor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our associates, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, accommodation and working conditions, benefits, work authorization requirements, insurance matters, workers\u2019 compensation, disability laws such as the ADA discussed above, child labor laws, and anti-discrimination laws.\nAlthough we believe that compliance with these laws has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date, we may experience material difficulties or failures with respect to compliance with such laws in the future. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in required renovations to our facilities, litigation, fines, penalties, judgments, or other sanctions, including the temporary suspension of bakery-cafe or fresh dough facility operations or a delay in construction or opening of a bakery-cafe, any of which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn addition, new government initiatives or changes to existing laws, such as the adoption and implementation of national, state, or local government proposals relating to increases in minimum wage rates, may increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRegulatory changes in and customer focus on nutrition and advertising practices could adversely affect our business.\nThere continues to be increased consumer emphasis on, and regulatory scrutiny of, restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments with respect to nutrition and advertising practices. While we have responded to these developments by updating our menu boards and printed menus in all of our Company-owned bakery-cafes to include caloric information, we may become subject to other regulations in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising which would require us to make certain additional nutritional information available to our customers or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients. We may experience higher costs associated with the implementation and oversight of such changes that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nRising insurance costs could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe self-insure a significant portion of potential losses under our workers\u2019 compensation, medical, general, auto, and property liability programs. The liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated, in part, by considering our historical claims experience and data from industry and other actuarial sources. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves of these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complaints and litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we have been, and we expect that in the future we will be, subject to complaints and litigation alleging that we are responsible for customer illness or injury suffered during or after a visit to one of our Company-owned bakery-cafes or franchise-operated bakery-cafes, including allegations of poor food quality, food-borne illness, adverse health effects, nutritional content or allergens, advertising claims or personal injury claims. Additionally, our expansion into the food delivery business could increase our exposure to claims related to injuries relating to accidents involving our delivery drivers. In addition, from time to time, we are subject to litigation by employees, investors, franchisees, and others through private actions, class actions\nor other forums, including those alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, overtime eligibility and failure to pay for all hours worked. The outcome of litigation, particularly class actions and regulatory actions, is inherently difficult to assess or quantify, and the defense against such claims or actions can be costly. In addition to decreasing sales and profitability and diverting financial and management resources, we may suffer from adverse publicity that could harm our brand, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are liable. Moreover, we are subject to the same risks of adverse publicity resulting from allegations even if the claim involves one of our franchisees. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nOur failure or inability to protect our trademarks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our business and competitive position.\nWe believe that our intellectual property and confidential and proprietary information are essential to our business and competitive position. Our trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, confidential and proprietary information, and other intellectual property rights, are key components of our operating and marketing strategies. Although we have taken steps to protect our brand, intellectual property, and confidential and proprietary information, these steps may not be adequate. Unauthorized usage or imitation by others could harm our image, brand, or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.\nWe do not believe that our trademarks, menu offerings or newly developed technology platforms related to our initiatives designed to improve bakery-cafe throughput, customer experience and greater access for our customers, infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. An infringement claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming to defend against, result in costly litigation, cause delays or suspensions in marketing or introducing new menu items in the future or the rollout of initiatives such as those noted above, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nWe try to ensure that our franchisees maintain and protect our brand and our confidential and proprietary information. However, since our franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, if they do not operate their bakery-cafes in a manner consistent with their agreements with us, our brand and reputation or the value of our confidential and proprietary information could be harmed. If this occurs, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely heavily on information technology and any material failure, interruption, or security breach in our systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for the order and delivery of fresh dough from our fresh dough facilities, point-of-sale processing in our bakery-cafes, gift and loyalty cards, online business, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution, and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations, and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem.\nUnforeseen weather may disrupt our business.\nUnforeseen natural events, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or other adverse weather and climate conditions, could disrupt our operations or those of our franchisees, or suppliers. These events could reduce traffic in our bakery-cafes, make it difficult or impossible for bakery-cafes to receive deliveries of ingredients or other products, and otherwise impede our or our franchisees\u2019 ability to continue business operations in a manner consistent with the level and extent of business activities prior to the occurrence of the unexpected weather, which in turn may materially and adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur operating results fluctuate due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, and any of which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from our forecasts, targets, or projections because of a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in average weekly net sales and comparable net bakery-cafe sales due to:\n\u2022\nlower customer traffic or average check per transaction, including as a result of the introduction or removal of new menu items;\n\u2022\nchanges in demographics, consumer preferences, and discretionary spending;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity about the ingredients we use or the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other problems at our bakery-cafes; and\n\u2022\nseasonality, including as a result of inclement weather.\n\u2022\ncost increases due to:\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating costs;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in supply costs, shortages or interruptions;\n\u2022\nlabor availability and increased labor costs, including wages and other compensation of management and associates, insurance, and health care; and\n\u2022\nchanges in business strategy including concept evolution and new designs.\n\u2022\nprofitability of new bakery-cafes, especially in new markets; and\n\u2022\ndelays in new bakery-cafe openings.\nAs a result of these factors, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Average weekly sales or comparable bakery-cafe sales in any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to fall. We believe the market price of our common stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. As a result, if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future, any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant.\nChanges in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results.\nNew accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. If we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.\nOur federal, state, and local tax returns have been, and may in the future be, selected for audit by the tax authorities, which may result in tax assessments or penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in the United States and Canada, including income, sales, use, and other applicable taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for taxes. Additionally, sales and use tax requirements are often fact-specific, complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, which complicates monitoring and compliance. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and our procedures for collecting sales taxes are appropriate, from time to time, federal, state, and local tax authorities have challenged, and may in the future challenge, positions we have taken on our tax returns or our sales tax collection policies. If we are unable to resolve these challenges favorably, we could incur additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. If material, payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication, or resolution of any disputes, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nA regional or global health pandemic could severely affect our business.\nA health pandemic is a disease outbreak that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time. If a regional or global health pandemic occurs, depending upon its duration, location, and severity, our business could be severely affected. Generally, we are viewed by our customers as a high-quality, friendly, all day destination where people can gather with family, friends, and business colleagues. Customers may avoid public gathering places in the event\nof a health pandemic, and local, regional, or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease. A regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact our business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of ingredients and products in our supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in our bakery-cafes.\nRegional factors could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations.\nThere are several states in which we, our franchisees, or both, own and operate a significant number of bakery-cafes. As a result, the economic conditions, state and local laws, government regulations, and weather conditions affecting those particular states, or a geographic region generally, may have a material impact upon our consolidated results of operations.\nIf we are unable to continue to repurchase our stock consistent with investor expectations, our earnings per share growth rate and stock price may be negatively affected.\nOur stock repurchase program could require the use of a significant portion of or exceed our cash flow. Our ability to repurchase stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future or to borrow money from available lending sources. Any failure to repurchase stock following an announcement of our intention to do so could negatively impact our earnings per share growth rate and potentially our stock price.\nMajor developments on trade relations resulting from the recent elections could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe 2016 United States presidential and congressional elections have introduced uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations impacting trade between the United States and other countries. We source several of our ingredients, paper products and other materials used within our business from suppliers outside of the United States, including Asia and Central America. Significant developments in trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on items imported by us, could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial results.", "PERMNO": 76695, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "PNRA"}
