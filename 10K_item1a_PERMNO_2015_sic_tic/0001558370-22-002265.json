Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report, including the financial statements. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive and you are encouraged to perform your own investigation with respect to us and our business.\nSummary Risk Factor\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk because our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as fully described below. The principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our Class A common stock risky include, among others:\n\u25cf The Foxconn Transactions, which are subject to various conditions to closing, including the entry into the Contract Manufacturing Agreement and the receipt of regulatory approvals, and our ability to enter into a joint product development agreement or similar agreement with an appropriate funding structure;\n\u25cf our ability to continue as a going concern, which requires us to manage costs and obtain significant additional funding well in advance of our target of third quarter 2022 for the start of commercial production and sale of the Endurance, and our ability to raise such funding on a reasonable timeline and with suitable terms;\n\u25cf our ability to raise sufficient capital in the future in order to invest in the tooling that we expect will enable us to eventually lower the Endurance bill of materials cost, continued design enhancements of the Endurance and any future vehicles we may develop;\n\u25cf the cost and other impacts of litigation, regulatory proceedings, investigations, complaints, product liability claims and/or adverse publicity, which may have a material adverse effect, whether or not successful or valid, on our business prospects and ability to obtain financing;\n\u25cf our ability to execute our business plan, including market acceptance of our planned products;\n\u25cf risks related to our limited operating history, the rollout of our business and the timing of expected business milestones, including our ability to complete the engineering of the Endurance and retooling of the production facility, to establish appropriate supplier relationships, to successfully complete testing, homologation and certification and to start production of the Endurance, in accordance with our projected timeline;\n\u25cf our ability to source and maintain suppliers for our critical components and the terms of such arrangements, and our ability to complete building out our supply chain;\n\u25cf the availability and cost of raw materials and components, particularly in light of current supply chain disruptions, inflation, and the consequences of such shortages on testing and other activities, which could present challenges that impact the timing of our commercial production;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain binding purchase orders and build customer relationships, including uncertainties as to whether and to what degree we are able to convert previously-reported nonbinding pre-orders and other indications of interest in our vehicle into binding orders and ultimately sales;\n\u25cf our ability to deliver on the expectations of customers with respect to the pricing, performance, quality, reliability, safety and efficiency of the Endurance and to provide the levels of service and support that they will require;\n\u25cf our ability to conduct business using a direct sales model, rather than through a dealer network used by most other OEMs;\n\u25cf the effects of competition on our ability to market and sell vehicles;\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u25cf our business, expansion plans, strategic alliances and opportunities;\n\u25cf the pace and depth of electric vehicle adoption generally;\n\u25cf our expectations regarding our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection and not infringe on the rights of others;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals and changes in laws, regulatory requirements, governmental incentives and fuel and energy prices;\n\u25cf the impact of health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our business, the other risks we face and the actions we may take in response thereto;\n\u25cf cybersecurity threats and compliance with privacy and data protection laws;\n\u25cf failure to timely implement and maintain adequate financial, information technology and management processes and controls and procedures; and\n\u25cf the possibility that we may be adversely affected by other economic, business and/or competitive factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nThe transactions contemplated with Foxconn under the Asset Purchase Agreement are subject to closing conditions, including further negotiation of the Contract Manufacturing Agreement, the Lordstown Facility Lease and regulatory approvals, and may not be consummated, provide the benefits that we seek and no assurances can be given that we will enter into a joint product development agreement or other agreements with Foxconn.\nThe closing of the APA is subject to certain conditions, including (a) the parties entering into the Contract Manufacturing Agreement and Lordstown Facility Lease and (b) receipt of a communication that the CFIUS has concluded that the transaction is not a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d or that CFIUS has completed its review of the transaction and determined there are no national security concerns with the transaction. If the APA is terminated or if the transaction does not close prior to the later of (i) April 30, 2022 and (ii) 10 days after the transaction is cleared by CFIUS, we are obligated to repay the down payments to Foxconn plus accrued interest. Furthermore, among other conditions, we are required to maintain minimum cash balances of $50 million through March 1, 2022 and $30 million thereafter. We have granted Foxconn a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the repayment and other obligations under the APA. Should we default on our obligations or the APA does not close, we are unlikely to have sufficient available cash to repay Foxconn\u2019s down payments. As a result, Foxconn may exercise its rights under the APA, including, but not limited to foreclosing on its liens on some or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. Under such circumstances, we would not likely be able to continue as a going concern or realize any value from our assets.\nWe require the funding, operational and supply chain support that we expect to receive from the Foxconn transactions as described above (see Part I-Item 1. Business-Foxconn Transactions), including a joint product development agreement and an appropriate funding structure that enables us to raise substantial additional capital necessary to bring the Endurance into production and to fund future vehicle development.\nBecause the APA is subject to conditions to closing, including the further negotiation of additional agreements and regulatory and other matters that are outside of our control, there is no assurance that we will complete\nany of the transactions contemplated by the APA. Further, the Contract Manufacturing Agreement, Lordstown Facility Lease, and any additional agreements related to financing or joint product development are subject to the negotiation of terms satisfactory to both parties. No assurances can be given as to the timing or completion of any such agreements or the extent to which such agreements would be on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to successfully complete the contemplated transactions and relationship with Foxconn on a timely basis, our business plan, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely impaired.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict whether we will be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits from any aspects of our contemplated relationship with Foxconn, particularly since Foxconn has a limited operating history manufacturing EVs. A variety of other factors, including our need for additional financing, supply chain disruptions, and the consequences of these factors on testing and other activities, could present challenges that impact the timing and cost of our commercial production.\nWe require significant additional capital to implement our business plan, and it may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, creating substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe design, manufacture and sale of vehicles is a capital-intensive and complex business. Our business plan to design, produce, sell and service the Endurance and any additional vehicles requires substantial additional capital for, and well in advance of, commencing commercial production at reasonable scale. Even if the Foxconn Transactions are consummated in accordance with the current terms and on the anticipated timeline, we will need additional funding to continue our development efforts and maintain our current plans and timeline for commercial production. The amounts required are significant and we believe will be very difficult to raise without an additional investment from, or participation by, Foxconn in such a funding.\nThe opinion of our independent registered public accountants on our audited financial statements as\nof and for the year ended December 31, 2021 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to complete the development of our electric vehicles, obtain regulatory approval, raise substantial capital, begin commercial scale production and launch the sale of such vehicles. As our current level of cash and cash equivalents is not sufficient to fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale of such vehicles, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this report. If we are not able to continue as a going concern, or if there is continued doubt about our ability to do so, the value of your investment would be materially and adversely affected, or perhaps may not have any value.\nTo alleviate these conditions, management is delaying certain expenditures in order to fund operations at reduced levels, pursuing the Foxconn Transactions and additional Foxconn arrangements, and evaluating various funding alternatives, including seeking to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, mezzanine or debt securities, through arrangements with strategic partners or through obtaining financing from government or financial institutions. However, thus far, our access to additional capital has been limited. Numerous factors, including the significant amount of capital required, the fact that our bill of materials is currently, and expected to continue to be, substantially higher than our anticipated selling price, uncertainty surrounding regulatory approval and the performance of the vehicle, along with meaningful exposure to material losses related to ongoing litigation and the SEC investigation, among other factors are impeding our ability to raise capital. There can be no assurances that we will raise sufficient additional capital as and when needed.\nThe Equity Purchase Agreement is subject to certain limitations and conditions. The actual amount that we can raise under this facility will depend on market conditions as well as limitations in the agreement. In particular, at current market prices of our shares of Class A common stock, without stockholder approval, we cannot issue or sell to YA shares of our Class A common stock in excess of 35,144,690 shares (the\n\u201cExchange Cap\u201d), which would limit the amount of funds we are able to raise to significantly less than the $400 million commitment under the Equity Purchase Agreement.\nAs we seek additional sources of financing, there can be no assurance that such financing would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the debt and equity capital markets is subject to several factors, including market and economic conditions, our performance and investor sentiment with respect to us and our industry.\nThese factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financings unattractive to us. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our currently issued and outstanding equity or debt, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution, which may be substantial. We believe, given the financial and operational challenges we are facing, it is likely that we would issue preferred stock or debt, which may be secured. Such preferred stock or debt securities would have liquidation and other preferences that could impair the recovery of our Class A common stock. In addition, such securities may have covenants that restrict our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe have accepted an invitation from the U.S. Department of Energy and have started the due diligence process toward securing an ATVM loan. We have been informed that an ATVM loan would likely be secured by a first priority lien on our assets. There can be no assurance that this loan will be available to us and, if made available, what the amount, terms, collateral requirements and timing for any funding would be. In the near term, we do not believe that we would be able to satisfy the conditions to obtain an ATVM loan, including the requirement to demonstrate our viability as a company.\nIf we are unable to raise substantial additional capital in the near term, our operations and production plans will be scaled back or curtailed and, if any funds raised are insufficient to provide a bridge to full commercial production, our operations could be severely curtailed or cease entirely. Further, if the APA does not close, including because we are unable to fulfill our obligations to maintain our minimum cash balance commitments under the APA, we are unlikely to have sufficient available cash to repay Foxconn\u2019s down payments. As a result, Foxconn may exercise its rights under the APA, including, but not limited to foreclosing on its liens on some or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. Under such circumstances, we would not likely be able to continue as a going concern or realize any value from our assets.\nEven if we secure necessary financing in the short term, we expect our future growth to continue to require substantial funding, and the timing for and ability to generate sufficient funds from operations is uncertain. We also intend to develop additional all-electric vehicles geared for the commercial market, which will require additional capital investment with returns and timelines that will be difficult to predict. Unlike established OEMs that have greater financial resources than we do, there can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital we need on favorable terms when required or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition and business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have faced and expect to continue to face disruptions to the supply chain, affecting our access to critical raw materials and components, and may be unable to adequately control the costs or maintain adequate supply of components and raw materials to facilitate completion of our development plans and full commercial production timeline.\nWe may be unable to adequately control the costs associated with our operations, even with continued refinement of our operating plan. We expect to incur significant costs related to procuring materials required to manufacture, assemble and test our vehicles. The prices for and availability of these materials fluctuate depending on factors beyond our control.\nDisruptions to the supply chain, including those due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in challenges obtaining certain components and raw materials in a timely manner and/or at favorable pricing. As a result, we have adjusted and may continue to adjust our design, materials, components,\nproduction processes, and production timeline to adapt to these limitations. Further changes in our timeline, capital resources, business conditions, the impact of COVID-19 or other pandemics, governmental changes, actual or threatened geopolitical conflict or war and other factors beyond our control or that we do not presently anticipate, could affect our ability to receive the material we need for production.\nOur business also depends on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles. We are exposed to multiple risks relating to availability and pricing of quality lithium-ion battery cells. As we and the broader electric vehicle industry grow in the future, there is no guarantee that battery cell manufacturers will be able and willing to continue to increase their capacity to meet demand. In addition, the automotive and other industries are currently experiencing a global supply shortage of semiconductors, which has impacted and could continue to impact our testing and production costs, and volume and timeline of production. Furthermore, inflation has significantly impacted the prices of key raw materials that will be included in the Endurance and its components, such as steel, aluminum, copper, neodymium, nickel and cobalt. Inflation has also impacted our labor costs and certain indirect costs, such as utilities, and there continue to be supply shortages of certain materials and components.\nFurthermore, currency fluctuations, labor shortages, tariffs or shortages in petroleum, steel and aluminum or other raw materials and other economic or political conditions have impacted the transportation industry and resulted and may continue to result in significant increases in freight charges, delays in obtaining critical materials or changes in the specifications for those materials.\nAs a result of the foregoing and limited initial production volume, our current bill of materials cost is substantially higher than the anticipated selling price of the Endurance at launch. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our bill of materials cost below our anticipated selling price Endurance.\nPrices for our raw materials, components and other inputs may continue to increase our operating costs and could further reduce our margins. In addition, the growth in popularity of electric vehicles without a significant expansion in battery cell production capacity or sufficient availability of semiconductors could result in shortages, which would increase our cost of materials and impact our prospects. These factors could also delay our overall production timeline, limit production volume and impact our profitability and cash flows.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects.\nWe are a company with a limited operating history and have generated no revenue to date. As we attempt to transition from research and development activities to commercial production and sales, it has been and will continue to be difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results. We have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. The estimated costs and timelines that we have developed and continue to revise to reach full scale commercial production are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties involved in the transition from a start-up company focused on research and development activities to the large-scale manufacture and sale of vehicles. We have already incurred increased costs and there can be no assurance that our further estimates related to the costs and timing necessary to complete the design and engineering of the Endurance and to complete the retooling of the Lordstown facility will prove accurate. Our current cost of our bill of materials for the Endurance is well above our anticipated selling price. Until such time as we are able to lower the bill of materials, we are likely to limit our expected production in order to minimize our losses, which we anticipate being through 2023 or potentially longer. These are complex processes that may be subject to further delays, cost overruns and other unforeseen issues.\nIn addition, we have engaged in limited marketing activities to date, so even if we are able to bring the Endurance to market on time and on budget, there can be no assurance that fleet customers will embrace our product in significant numbers. Market conditions, many of which are outside of our control and subject to change, including the availability and terms of financing, general economic conditions, the impacts and\nongoing uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic, fuel and energy prices, regulatory requirements and incentives, competition and the pace and extent of vehicle electrification generally, will impact demand for the Endurance, other vehicles we develop and ultimately our success.\nSince our inception, we have experienced losses and expect to incur additional losses in the future.\nSince inception, we have incurred, and we expect in the future that we will continue to incur, losses and negative cash flow, either or both of which may be significant. The working capital funding necessary to start a new electric vehicle manufacturing company is significant, and other companies have tried and failed over the last several years with billions of dollars of investment capital. While we expect to benefit from our management\u2019s experience, the technology we have licensed and developed to date and the advantages offered by the Lordstown facility and the Foxconn Transactions, we do not expect to be profitable for several years, and perhaps longer, as we invest in our business, build capacity and ramp up operations, and we cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or be able to maintain profitability in the future. Failure to become profitable may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. If we are ever to achieve profitability, it will be dependent upon additional capital as well as the successful development and commercial introduction and acceptance of the Endurance and other vehicles we develop, which may not occur.\nAs discussed above, significant additional funding is required in the future for a variety of reasons. There can be no assurance that financing will be available to us on favorable terms and timing or at all. We and our auditors have identified conditions and events that raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are not able to continue as a going concern, or if there is continued doubt about our ability to do so, the value of your investment would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe face various risks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The effects and potential effects of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, its impact on general economic conditions, trade and financing markets, labor shortages, changes in customer behavior and continuity in business operations, create significant uncertainty.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has also disrupted the manufacturing, delivery and overall supply chain of vehicle manufacturers and suppliers and has led to a global decrease in vehicle sales in markets around the world. In particular, the COVID-19 crisis may cause a decrease in demand for our vehicles if fleet operators delay purchases of vehicles generally, if prices for fuel used by internal combustion engine vehicles decrease materially or they defer electric vehicle purchases in particular. In addition, the COVID-19 crisis has caused and may continue to cause (i) disruptions to our supply chain, including our access to critical raw materials and components, many of which require substantial lead time, or cause a substantial increase in the price of those items, (ii) an increase in other costs as a result of our efforts to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, and (iii) disruptions in our manufacturing operations and delays in our schedule to full commercial production of the Endurance, among other negative effects.\nThe pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing many measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place and stay-at- home orders and business shutdowns. These measures may be in place for a significant period of time and may be reinstituted if conditions deteriorate, which could adversely affect our start-up and manufacturing plans. Measures that have been relaxed may be reimplemented if COVID-19 or variants of COVID-19 continue to spread or if vaccination programs are slower or less effective than anticipated. If, as a result of these measures, we have to limit the number of employees and contractors at the Lordstown facility at a given time, it could cause a delay in retooling efforts or in the production schedule of the Endurance. Further, our sales and marketing activities may be adversely affected due to the cancellation or reduction of in-person sales activities,\nmeetings, events and conferences. If our workforce is unable to work effectively, including due to illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19 or variants of COVID-19, our operations will be adversely affected. Our planned operations at a single facility, the Lordstown facility, concentrate these risks.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to affect our business will depend on continued developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, and the pandemic has and may continue to exacerbate the other risks described in this report. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to suffer an adverse effect on our business due to the global economic effect of COVID-19, including continued supply chain disruption and any economic recession. If the immediate or prolonged effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have a significant adverse impact on government finances, it would create uncertainty as to the continuing availability of incentives related to electric vehicle purchases and other governmental support programs.\nFailure to successfully complete the retooling of the Lordstown facility to support commercial production of electric vehicles could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWhile we believe the Lordstown facility provides significant competitive advantages, retooling and modifying the facility for production of electric vehicles has and may continue to be complicated and present significant challenges, including the cost overruns we have already experienced. The Lordstown facility is massive, spanning over 6.2 million square feet, and many areas have needed to be retooled and modified. The facility is in near-production-ready condition with modern robotics, painting, assembly and stamping equipment, and we are working towards completing our production lines for in-wheel motors and initial lithium-ion battery packs. However, we will need to continue to make investments in order to commence full production of the Endurance, which requires us to raise additional financing. Further, we will need sufficient capital in the future in order to invest in the tooling that we expect will enable us to eventually lower the bill of materials cost of the Endurance and make continued design enhancements. Following the closing of the APA, we would continue to be responsible for additional capital investments for certain tooling and other equipment specifically related to production of the Endurance. Foxconn would own and be responsible for maintaining and investing in general manufacturing and assembly assets, excluding the battery and hub motor lines that would be operated by Foxconn, but owned and maintained by us. As with any large-scale capital project, retooling the Lordstown facility could be subject to further delays, cost overruns or other complications. These risks could be exacerbated because we are attempting to modify a complex facility, originally designed to build traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, to support the emerging technologies behind electric vehicles. In addition, we have made significant investments in soft tools that are designed for low volume production and prototyping. As we contemplate investing in hard tools that are designed for higher volumes, the value of our soft tools may be impaired or determined to have no value at all. These soft tools will be depreciated over their useful lives, but as we contemplate investing in hard tools that are designed for higher volumes, the value of our soft tools may be impaired. Therefore, some or perhaps a material portion of our soft tool assets may need to be written down or written entirely off.\nIn order to commence commercial production at the Lordstown facility, we will also need to hire and train a significant number of additional employees and integrate a yet-to-be-fully-developed supply chain. A failure to commence commercial production at the Lordstown facility on schedule would lead to additional costs and would delay our ability to generate meaningful revenues, if at all. In addition, it would allow competitors to enter the market and capture market share before us, prevent us from gaining the confidence of potential customers and open the door to increased competition. All the foregoing could hinder our ability to successfully launch and grow our business and achieve a competitive position in the market.\nWe will rely on complex machinery for our operations and production involves a significant degree of risk and uncertainty in terms of operational performance and costs.\nThe production of our vehicles will rely heavily on complex machinery and will involve a significant degree of uncertainty and risk in terms of operational performance and costs. The manufacturing plant will consist of\nlarge-scale machinery combining many components. The manufacturing plant components are likely to suffer unexpected malfunctions from time to time and will depend on repairs and spare parts to resume operations, which may not be available when needed.\nUnexpected malfunctions of the manufacturing plant components may significantly affect the intended operational efficiency of the Lordstown facility. Further, if we successfully close the transactions contemplated by the APA, Foxconn would own the Lordstown facility and general manufacturing and assembly assets will be its responsibility and under its control. Foxconn would operate the equipment under the Contract Manufacturing Agreement. If Foxconn is unable to timely and effectively maintain the equipment our vehicles rely on for production, we may experience a significant interruption in our ability to supply the Endurance. Operational performance and costs can be difficult to predict and are often influenced by factors outside of our control, such as, but not limited to, scarcity of natural resources, environmental hazards and remediation, costs associated with decommissioning of machines, labor disputes and strikes, difficulty or delays in obtaining governmental permits, damages or defects in electronic systems, industrial accidents, pandemics, fire, seismic activity and natural disasters. Should operational risks materialize, it may result in the personal injury to or death of workers, the loss of production equipment, damage to manufacturing facilities, monetary losses, delays and unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage, administrative fines, increased insurance costs and potential legal liabilities, all which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or prospects.\nWe anticipate outsourcing the manufacturing of the Endurance to Foxconn under the Contract Manufacturing Agreement, and we may be subject to risks that result in the disruption of production and our operations.\nAs part of the Foxconn Transactions, we expect to enter into the Contract Manufacturing Agreement with Foxconn, pursuant to which Foxconn would manufacture the Endurance at the Lordstown facility. We would continue to own certain assets in the Lordstown facility, principally the hub motor and battery module packing lines and tooling specific to the Endurance. However, we anticipate Foxconn would operate and be responsible for the equipment under its control.\nThe manufacture of the Endurance by Foxconn would require the successful coordination among us and Foxconn, and will depend on our ability to, for example, jointly manage a production schedule, coordinate with suppliers and forecast the appropriate quantity of supplies, disseminate proprietary information and technology, conduct product testing and meet quality assurance standards. If we are unable to maintain our relationship with Foxconn or effectively manage outsourcing the production of the Endurance to Foxconn, we may be unable to ensure continuity, quality, and compliance with our design specifications or applicable laws and regulations, which may ultimately disrupt our production and operations.\nEven if we are able to successfully coordinate our manufacturing relationship with Foxconn, events beyond our control could result in the inability of Foxconn to timely and effectively manufacture the Endurance. Foxconn may experience interruptions with manufacturing processes such as, but not limited to, the malfunction of the equipment under its control, capacity constraints, the inability to obtain the necessary permits or the failure to meet our quality standards or production needs. Any such interruptions could result in product defects or shortages, manufacturing failures or vehicles not being manufactured to their applicable specifications or could impair our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our vehicles, which may result in the delay of the launch of the Endurance and our supply of vehicles into the market. Further, by outsourcing production to Foxconn, we may be unable to react quickly or effectively to any unanticipated changes that may arise during production. We may not be able to resolve any such issues related to outsourcing the manufacturing of the Endurance in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all, which could materially adversely affect our production, business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWith our vehicle still under development, we do not have any current customers or any pending orders and there is no assurance non-binding pre-orders and other indications of interest will be converted into binding orders or sales.\nOur business model is focused on building relationships with large fleet customers. To date, we have engaged in limited marketing activities, and we have no binding purchase orders or commitments from customers. The previously reported non-binding pre-orders that we have signed and other indications of interest that we have received do not require customer deposits (although we have some customer deposits) and may not be converted into binding orders or sales. We have also engaged in discussions with fleet managers and other organizations that have indicated interest from their customers or stakeholders in the Endurance. Until the time that the Endurance\u2019s design and development is complete and tested and the Endurance is commercially available for purchase, and until we are able to scale up our marketing function to support sales, there will be uncertainty as to customer demand for the Endurance. The potentially long wait from the time a non-binding pre-order is made, or other indication of interest is provided until the time the Endurance is delivered, and any delays beyond expected wait times, could also impact customer decisions on whether to ultimately make a purchase. Even if we are able to obtain binding orders, customers may limit their volume of purchases initially as they assess our vehicles and whether to make a broader transition to electric vehicles.\nCommercializing the Endurance and other potential vehicles we may develop will be a long process and depends on our ability to fund and scale up our productions, including through the consummation of the Foxconn Transactions and securing additional funding, and expand our marketing functions, as well as the safety, reliability, efficiency and quality of our vehicles, and the support and service that will be available. It will also depend on factors outside of our control, such as competition, general market conditions and broader trends in fleet management and vehicle electrification, that could impact customer buying decisions. As a result, there is significant uncertainty regarding demand for our products and the pace and levels of growth that we will be able to achieve.\nOur future growth depends upon our ability to maintain relationships with our existing suppliers and source suppliers for our critical components, and to complete building out our supply chain, while effectively managing the risks due to such relationships.\nOur success will be dependent upon our ability to enter into supply agreements and maintain our relationships with suppliers who are critical and necessary to the output and production of our vehicles. We also rely on a small group of suppliers to provide us with key components for our vehicles. The supply agreements we have or may enter into with key suppliers in the future may have provisions where such agreements can be terminated in various circumstances, including potentially without cause, or may not provide for access to supplies in accordance with our timeline or budget. If these suppliers become unable to provide, experience delays in providing or impose significant increases in the cost of components, or if the supply agreements we have in place are terminated, it may be difficult to find replacement components. Changes in business conditions, pandemics, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or that we do not presently anticipate could affect our ability to receive components from our suppliers.\nFurther, we have not secured supply agreements for all of our components. We may be at a disadvantage in negotiating supply agreements for the production of our vehicles due to our limited operating history, low production volumes and continued refinement of our component requirements through the design and testing process, as well as concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, there is the possibility that finalizing the supply agreements for the parts and components of our vehicles will cause significant disruption to our operations, or such supply agreements could be at costs that make it difficult for us to operate profitably or delay our production schedule.\nIf we do not enter into long-term supply agreements with guaranteed pricing and availability for our parts or components, we may be exposed to fluctuations in prices, quality and timing of components, materials and equipment. Our current agreement for the purchase of battery cells contains, and future agreements are likely to contain, pricing provisions that are subject to adjustment based on changes in market prices of key commodities and require us to make minimum purchases irrespective of our production plans. Substantial increases in the prices for such components, materials and equipment would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs. Any attempts to increase the announced or expected prices of our vehicles in response to increased costs could be viewed negatively by our potential customers and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results.\nWe have experienced and may in the future experience delays in realizing our projected timelines and cost and volume targets for the production, launch and ramp up of the Endurance and the retooling of the Lordstown facility, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to finance, develop, manufacture, market and sell or lease the Endurance. Any delay in the financing, design, testing, manufacture and launch of the Endurance, in completing the retooling of the Lordstown facility or consummating the Foxconn Transactions and other related agreements being contemplated, including a joint product development agreement, could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Vehicle manufacturers often experience delays in the design, testing, manufacture and commercial release of new products and further delays in the production of the Endurance are possible.\nTo the extent we experience delays in completing the retooling of the Lordstown facility, consummating the Foxconn Transactions and other related agreements being contemplated, including a joint product development agreement, launching the Endurance or obtaining the funding needed to reach scaled production, our growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, production delays would allow competitors to enter the market and capture market share before us, prevent us from gaining the confidence of potential customers and open the door to increased competition. Furthermore, we rely on third-party suppliers for the provision and development of many of the key components and materials used in our vehicles. To the extent our suppliers experience any delays in providing us with or developing necessary components, or we need to find alternative sources or further develop our own components, whether due to COVID-19, disruptions to or instability of the global economy or other reasons, we could experience delays in meeting our projected timelines.\nFurther, we have no experience to date in high-volume manufacturing, or in outsourcing the high-volume manufacturing, of our vehicles. Even if we are successful in developing our high-volume manufacturing capability and processes, in conjunction with Foxconn, and in reliably sourcing our component supply, we cannot assure that we will be able to do so in a manner that avoids significant delays and cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers, delays in testing or receipt of required regulatory approvals to sell the Endurance, or failure to satisfy customer requirements.\nWe will initially depend on revenue generated from a single model and in the foreseeable future will be significantly dependent on a limited number of models.\nWhile we intend to develop additional vehicles, including through our potential collaboration with Foxconn, we will initially depend on revenue generated from a single vehicle model and in the foreseeable future will be significantly dependent on a single or limited number of models, including the Endurance, for which the bill of materials cost is currently anticipated to be significantly in excess of our anticipated selling price at launch. Historically, automobile customers have come to expect a variety of vehicle models offered in a manufacturer\u2019s fleet and new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. Given that for at least the next several years our business will likely depend on a single or limited number of models, to the extent a\nparticular model is not well-received by the market, our sales volume, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our vehicles fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell or lease our electric vehicles could be harmed.\nAs a new entrant to the industry attempting to build brand recognition and establish relationships with commercial fleets and fleet managers, it is very important that our vehicles and our service and support meet the expectations of our customers when we commence production and sales. If our vehicles were to contain defects in design and/or manufacture, including if they are manufactured by Foxconn, that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, our ability to develop, market and sell or lease our vehicles could be harmed. We currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term quality, reliability and performance characteristics of our trucks, battery packs and other products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and repair any defects in our products before commencing the sale of our vehicles.\nIn addition, the performance specifications of the Endurance may vary from our current estimates and could change over time and from vehicle to vehicle based on a number of factors, including the manner in which the vehicle is used or maintained, driving conditions and weather and other environmental conditions where the vehicle is used. While we are performing extensive internal testing on the Endurance, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics of our battery packs, powertrains and vehicles. There can be no assurance that the Endurance will perform in accordance with our published specifications, consistently or at all.\nFurther, the operation of our vehicles will be highly dependent on software that will require modification and updates over time. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced. Any product defects or any other failure of our vehicles to perform as expected, including during testing or with respect to our initial deliveries to customers, could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability or false advertising claims or significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Until we are able build customer relationships and earn trust, any of these effects could be particularly significant to us.\nIf we fail to scale our business operations or otherwise manage future growth effectively as we attempt to rapidly grow our company, we may not be able to produce, market, service and sell or lease our vehicles successfully.\nAny failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition. We plan to commence limited production of the Endurance at the Lordstown facility in the third quarter of 2022 and have the objective to grow thereafter through the consummation of the Foxconn Transactions and other contemplated agreements, subject to the receipt of additional capital. We also intend to leverage our technologies and relationship with Foxconn to develop additional all-electric vehicles geared to the commercial market that will require us to commit additional financial, engineering and management resources. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage our expansion and growth successfully. However, we have no experience to date in high-volume manufacturing, or in outsourcing high-volume manufacturing, of our vehicles. We cannot assure that we will be able to fund and develop efficient, automated, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes, and reliable sources of component supply, including in conjunction with Foxconn if the APA is consummated, that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, as well as the production volumes, required to successfully market our vehicles. Any failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities within our projected costs and timelines could stunt our future growth and impair our ability to produce, market, service and sell or lease our vehicles successfully.\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate the supply and demand for our vehicles, which could result in a variety of inefficiencies in our business and hinder our ability to generate revenue. If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs or experience delays.\nIt is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. Since inception, we have reevaluated our production plan and readiness multiple times, which has contributed to an increase in ramp up costs and need for additional funding. We have been and will continue to be required to provide forecasts of our demand to our suppliers several months prior to the scheduled delivery of products to our prospective customers. Currently, there is no historical basis for making judgments on the demand for our vehicles or our ability to develop, manufacture and deliver vehicles, or on our profitability in the future. If we overestimate our requirements, our suppliers may have excess inventory, which indirectly would increase our costs. If we underestimate our requirements, our suppliers may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products including if by Foxconn and result in delays in shipments and revenues. In addition, lead times for materials and components that our suppliers order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms, widespread supply shortages and demand for each component at a given time. If we fail to order sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, the delivery of vehicles to our customers could be delayed, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur future growth is dependent upon the willingness of operators of commercial vehicle fleets to adopt electric vehicles and upon our ability to produce, sell and provide service for vehicles that meet their needs. If the market for commercial electric vehicles does not develop as we expect, or if it develops slower than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur growth is dependent upon the adoption of electric vehicles by operators of commercial vehicle fleets and on our ability to produce, sell and provide service for vehicles that meet their needs. The entry of commercial electric pickup trucks and other electric vehicles into the commercial vehicle market is a relatively new development, particularly in the United States, and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving government regulation, industry standards and customer views of the merits of using electric vehicles in their businesses. This process has been slow to date. As part of our sales efforts, we must educate fleet managers as to the economical savings during the life of the vehicle and the lower \u201ctotal cost of ownership\u201d of our vehicles. As such, we believe that operators of commercial vehicle fleets will consider many factors when deciding whether to purchase our commercial electric vehicles (or commercial electric vehicles generally) or vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. We believe these factors include:\n\u25cf the difference between the initial purchase prices of commercial electric vehicles and comparable vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, both including and excluding the effect of government and other subsidies and incentives designed to promote the purchase of electric vehicles;\n\u25cf the total cost of ownership of the vehicle over its expected life, which includes the initial purchase price and ongoing operating and maintenance costs;\n\u25cf the availability and terms of financing options for purchases of vehicles and, for commercial electric vehicles, financing options for battery systems;\n\u25cf the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles and future regulations requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles;\n\u25cf government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;\n\u25cf fuel prices, including volatility in the cost of fuel or a prolonged period of low diesel, gasoline and natural gas costs that could decrease incentives to transition to electric vehicles;\n\u25cf the cost and availability of other alternatives to diesel or gasoline-fueled vehicles, such as vehicles powered by natural gas;\n\u25cf corporate sustainability initiatives;\n\u25cf commercial electric vehicle quality, performance and safety (particularly with respect to lithium-ion battery packs);\n\u25cf the quality and availability of service for the vehicle, including the availability of replacement parts;\n\u25cf the limited range over which commercial electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge;\n\u25cf access to charging stations and related infrastructure costs, and standardization of electric vehicle charging systems;\n\u25cf electric grid capacity and reliability; and\n\u25cf macroeconomic factors.\nIf, in weighing these factors, operators of commercial vehicle fleets determine that there is not a compelling business justification for purchasing commercial electric vehicles, particularly those that we will produce and sell, then the market for commercial electric vehicles may not develop as we expect or may develop more slowly than we expect, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, any reduction, elimination or selective application of tax and other governmental incentives and subsidies because of policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the electric vehicle, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the electric vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Further, we cannot assure that the current governmental incentives and subsidies available for purchasers of electric vehicles will remain available.\nIf we are unable to address the service requirements of our future customers or if there is inadequate access to charging stations, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nDemand for the Endurance and other vehicles we may produce will depend in part on the availability of service providers and charging infrastructure. Servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing internal combustion engine or hybrid vehicles and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques. As the Endurance is not in production yet, we do not have experience servicing the Endurance. The Endurance also will require the use of charging stations to recharge its batteries. While the prevalence of charging stations has been increasing, charging station locations are significantly less widespread than gas stations. We expect to partner with third-party service providers to maintain and repair the Endurance. We may partner with third-party electric vehicle station providers to offer installation of charging stations to our customers. We have limited arrangements in place with such third parties to date and will need to establish a network that provides sufficient availability and convenience to attract customers and convert interest in our vehicles into sales. Some potential customers may choose not to purchase the Endurance because of the lack of a more widespread service network or charging infrastructure at the time of sale. If we are unable to satisfactorily service our future customers or provide seamless access to charging infrastructure, our ability to generate customer loyalty, grow our business and sell Endurance and other vehicles we may produce could be impaired. In addition, our potential customers may be unwilling to purchase the Endurance due to actual or perceived concerns over our ability to remain a going concern and provide long term aftermarket service and support as is typical of the automotive industry.\nWe depend upon key personnel and will need to hire and train additional personnel. If we lose key management or significant personnel, cannot recruit or effectively integrate qualified employees, directors, officers, or other personnel or experience increases in our compensation costs, our business may materially suffer.\nWe have recently experienced changes in our senior management. While we expect an orderly transition process as new management is integrated into various roles, we face a variety of risks and uncertainties relating to management transition, including diversion of management attention from business concerns, failure to retain other key personnel or loss of institutional knowledge. These risks and uncertainties could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and\nadditional added costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations, stock price and research and development of our products.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit top talent, the continuing services of our management team and other key employees. We believe the depth and quality of the experience of our management team in the automotive and electric vehicle markets is a key to our ability to be successful. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. We do not carry \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance on the lives of any of our executives, employees or advisors. As with any company with limited resources, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals or that the presence of such individuals will necessarily translate into our profitability. Because we operate in a newly emerging industry, there may also be limited personnel available with relevant business experience and such individuals may be subject to non-competition and other agreements that restrict their ability to work for us. We also continue to seek personnel with appropriate accounting expertise to support the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting. We experience intense competition for qualified personnel and may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly. The challenge will be exacerbated for us as we attempt to transition from start-up to full-scale commercial vehicle manufacturing and sales in a very short period of time under the unforeseeable business conditions which continue to evolve as a result of the impact of COVID-19. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel may materially and adversely affect our business operations. Any failure by our management to effectively anticipate, implement and manage the changes required to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition and associated risks, including that we may not be among the first to market with an electric pickup truck. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial or other resources, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do and one or more of these competitors could use their greater resources and/or name recognition to gain market share at our expense or could make it very difficult for us to establish significant market share.\nWe face intense competition in our industry, which we may be unable to manage, including the risk that we may not be among the first to market with an electric pickup truck. Established OEMs and new entrants to the industry have announced their intent and timelines to compete in the electric pickup truck market. In addition, established OEMs currently offer alternative fuel and hybrid pickup trucks to the commercial fleet market, which includes government fleets. If fleet operators begin transitioning to electric vehicles on a mass scale, which will be necessary for us to be successful, we expect that more competitors will enter the market and competition will become intense. Certain potential competitors, for example, have more significant financial resources, established market positions, long-standing relationships with customers and dealers who have more resources available to develop new products and introduce them into the marketplace than are currently available to us. As a result, our competitors may be able to compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we may be able to. This expected competition places significant pressure on our ability to achieve our goals of completing the development of the Endurance, completing the retooling of the Lordstown facility and commencing commercial production and sales. If we are unable to do this successfully our competitors may enter the market and capture market share, and we may not be able to compete successfully. This intense competitive environment may require us to make changes to our products, pricing, licensing, services, distribution or marketing to develop a market position, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe may not succeed in establishing, maintaining and strengthening our brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicles and components and our business, revenues and prospects.\nOur business and prospects heavily depend on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen our brand. If we are not able to establish, maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen our brand will depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in the United States, Japan, the European Union and\nChina, have greater name recognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong brand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur electric vehicles will compete for market share with vehicles powered by other vehicle technologies that may prove to be more attractive than our vehicle technologies.\nOur target market currently is serviced by manufacturers with existing customers and suppliers using proven and widely accepted fuel technologies. Additionally, our competitors are working on developing technologies that may be introduced in our target market. If any of these alternative technology vehicles can provide lower fuel costs, greater efficiencies, greater reliability or otherwise benefit from other factors resulting in an overall lower total cost of ownership, this may negatively affect the commercial success of our vehicles or make our vehicles uncompetitive or obsolete.\nWe may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology as new entrants and existing, larger manufacturers enter the electric vehicle space.\nThe Endurance is being designed for use with, and is dependent upon, existing electric vehicle technology. As new companies and larger, existing vehicle manufacturers enter the electric vehicle space, we may lose any technological advantage we may have had in the marketplace and suffer a decline in our position in the market. Further, certain technology used in the Endurance, such as in our infotainment system, relies on open source code and is not proprietary to us, and our competitors may also utilize such technology to develop their vehicles. As technologies change, we will attempt to upgrade or adapt our products to continue to provide products with the latest technology. However, our products may become obsolete, or our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in or to create the necessary technology to effectively compete. As a result, our potential inability to adapt to and develop the necessary technology may harm our competitive position.\nWe will not have a third-party retail product distribution network.\nThird-party dealer networks are the traditional method of vehicle sales distribution. Because we primarily plan to sell directly to commercial fleets and fleet managers, we will not have a traditional dealer product distribution network. Our building an in-house sales and marketing function would be expensive and time-consuming. If the lack of a traditional dealer product distribution network results in lost opportunities to generate sales, it could limit our ability to grow. If our use of an in-house sales and marketing team is not effective, our results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among commercial fleet operators, investors and others within our industry, then our financial condition, operating results and business prospects may suffer materially.\nCommercial fleet operators may be less likely to purchase our products if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that we will continue as a going concern. Accordingly, to build, maintain and grow our business, we must maintain confidence among commercial fleet operators, suppliers, investors and other parties with respect to our liquidity and long-term business prospects.\nMaintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors, such as our funding needs, the status of our relationship with Foxconn, limited operating history, significant outstanding litigation and SEC investigation matters, others\u2019 unfamiliarity with our products, competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles. Many of these factors are largely outside our control, and any negative perceptions about our long-term business prospects, even if exaggerated or unfounded, would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional capital.\nThere are complex software and technology systems that need to be developed in coordination with vendors and suppliers in order to reach production for our electric vehicles, and there can be no assurance such systems will be successfully developed.\nOur vehicles will use a substantial amount of third-party and in-house software codes and complex hardware to operate. The development of such advanced technologies is inherently complex, and we will need to coordinate with our vendors and suppliers in order to reach production for our electric vehicles. Defects and errors may be revealed over time and our control over the performance of third-party services and systems may be limited. Thus, our potential inability to develop the necessary software and technology systems may harm our competitive position.\nWe are relying on third-party suppliers to develop a number of emerging technologies for use in our products, including lithium-ion battery technology. These technologies are not today, and may not ever be, commercially viable. There can be no assurances that our suppliers will be able to meet the technological requirements, production timing and volume requirements to support our business plan. In addition, the technology may not comply with the cost, performance useful life and warranty characteristics we anticipate in our business plan. As a result, our business plan could be significantly impacted, and we may incur significant liabilities under warranty claims which could adversely affect our business, prospects, and results of operations.\nOur success may be dependent on our development and protection of intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on confidentiality and trade secret protections to protect our proprietary technology. All new developments by us will be owned by us. Our success will, in part, depend on our ability to obtain patents and trademarks and protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology. We are currently maintaining our engineering under confidentiality agreements and other agreements to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary technology. We have filed numerous trademark and patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) but have not received any federal registrations of any applications as of the date of filing of this report. Our trademark applications were filed on an \u201cintend-to-use\" basis, and as such will not be registered until we begin the commercial sale of our vehicles. Such a filing has a limited duration and requires a request of the USPTO to grant an extension. No assurances can be provided that such extension would be granted, and our ability to use the marks may be impeded. Although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors, our agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property, particularly with respect to conflicts of ownership relating to work product generated by our employees, consultants and contractors, and we cannot be certain that others will not gain access to our trade secrets and other proprietary technology. See Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nRisks Relating to Regulation and Claims\nWe face risks and uncertainties related to litigation, regulatory actions and government investigations and inquiries.\nWe are currently and may in the future be subject to, or become a party to, litigation, regulatory actions, and government investigations and inquiries. See Part I - item 3 - Legal Proceedings below and in our subsequent filings with the SEC for additional information.\nFrom time to time, we may also be involved in legal proceedings and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business, including those relating to employment matters, relationships with collaboration partners, intellectual property disputes, and other business matters. Any such lawsuits, claims, or investigations have been and may in the future be time-consuming, costly, divert management resources, increase our insurance costs, cause reputational harm or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business or result of operations.\nThe ongoing expense of lawsuits, investigations and any substantial settlement payment by us or damage award enforceable against us, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have already incurred significant legal fees to date and not all of the claims against us are covered by insurance. Furthermore, our insurers have raised, and may in the future raise, defenses as to coverage of all or some of the claims and, in any event, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient. At this time, the Company cannot predict the results of many of current proceedings, and future resolution of these matters could result in changes in management's estimates of losses, which could be material to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. We have not established provisions for most of the current proceedings as of December 31, 2021. Significant legal fees and costs of litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that are not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, the potential material adverse effect of the pending litigation, SEC investigation and related ongoing significant legal costs would likely impair our ability to raise the additional capital we need to launch the Endurance in the third quarter of 2022, and therefore increases the risk that our operations could be severely curtailed or cease entirely.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, or any litigation that we may be subject to or involved in may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and the Nasdaq Global Select Market on which our securities are listed. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq and other legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time-consuming and costly.\nThose laws, regulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. For example, it is difficult to predict what impact, if any, changes in federal laws and policies, including those relating to tax, environmental, labor and employment, will have on our business and industry, the economy as a whole, consumer confidence and discretionary spending. A failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are or may be subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business. These matters may involve claims by customers, suppliers, vendors, contractors, competitors, government agencies, stockholders or other parties regarding our products, development and advertising, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters, among other matters. We are also subject to employee claims against us based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, disability or violation of wage and labor laws. These claims may divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. The ongoing expense of any resulting lawsuits, and any substantial settlement payment by us or damage award enforceable against us, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have already incurred significant legal fees to date and not all of the claims against us are covered by insurance. Furthermore, our insurers have raised and may in the future raise, defenses as to coverage of all or some of the claims and, in any event, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Significant legal fees and costs in litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nProduct liability or other claims could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe risk of product liability claims, product recalls and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the manufacturing, marketing and sale of all vehicles, including electric vehicles. Although we have liability insurance policies in place, that insurance may be inadequate to cover all potential product claims. Any product recall or lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may not be\nable to secure additional liability insurance coverage on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed or at all. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product recall could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future product candidates. If we complete the outsourcing of our manufacturing of the Endurance to Foxconn, this will limit our control over the production of our vehicles and our ability to mitigate the risk of product issues that may arise in the manufacturing process. We cannot provide assurance that such claims and/or recalls will not be made in the future.\nThe acquisition of the Lordstown facility required us to accept all environmental responsibility for the real property.\nThe Asset Transfer Agreement between us and GM, pursuant to which we acquired the Lordstown facility, required us to accept the condition of the real property in \u201cas is - where is\u201d condition, including accepting all environmental conditions. The Lordstown facility and all of its facilities and real property present environmental risk, both known and unknown. Prior to entering into the Asset Transfer Agreement, GM completed an investigation and remediation project pursuant to an AOC under the U.S. EPA\u2019s RCRA Corrective Action Program. As part of the U.S. EPA\u2019s approval of GM\u2019s investigation and remediation project, GM placed an environmental covenant on the real property, which requires, among other things, (i) the maintenance of nominal financial assurance, (ii) the limitation of the real property to commercial/industrial use, (iii) the prohibition of groundwater for potable use, (iv) the implementation of a dust control plan and (v) the maintenance of impermeable surfaces on certain areas of the real property. We assumed these responsibilities under the environmental covenant as a condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Transfer Agreement. In addition, to further manage potential environmental risk, we have secured environmental liability insurance coverage as required under the Asset Transfer Agreement. Finally, to mitigate the risk associated with the Ohio EPA\u2019s authority to require future remediation activities at the Lordstown facility, related to historic environmental conditions, we have entered into an Administrative Order with the Ohio EPA wherein the Ohio EPA agreed to not pursue enforcement actions against us for historic environmental conditions at the Lordstown site provided that we comply with the terms of the environmental covenant. Notwithstanding the efforts that we have taken to mitigate environmental risk, there is no assurance that claims, lawsuits, fines or penalties will not arise. Our assumption of environmental liabilities at the Lordstown facility could expose us to potential costs and liabilities that could exceed or fall outside of our available insurance coverage and adversely impact our financial condition. Upon closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Foxconn will generally assume environmental liabilities arising from the Lordstown facility; however, we will retain an indemnity obligation for certain undisclosed liabilities known by us or caused by us during our period of ownership. Regulatory requirements may have a negative effect upon our business.\nRegulatory requirements may have a negative effect upon our business.\nAll vehicles sold must comply with international, federal and state motor vehicle safety standards. In the United States, vehicles that meet or exceed all federally mandated safety standards are certified under the federal regulations. Rigorous testing and the use of approved materials and equipment are among the requirements for achieving federal certification. The Endurance and any other vehicles we may produce will be subject to substantial regulation under federal, state and local laws and standards. These regulations include those promulgated by the U.S. EPA, the CARB, the NHTSA, the PHMSA and various state boards, and compliance certification is required for each new model year. These laws and standards are subject to change from time to time and we could become subject to additional regulations in the future. In addition, federal, state and local laws and industrial standards for electric vehicles are still developing. Compliance with these regulations, including obtaining necessary approvals, could be challenging, burdensome, time-consuming and expensive. If compliance and obtaining approvals results in delays or substantial expenses, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to liability for infringing upon other companies\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nOur success will, in part, depend on our ability to operate without infringing on others\u2019 proprietary rights. Although we are starting with a new design and development and are relying on the licensed rights from Elaphe, and while we are not aware of any patents and trademarks which would cause our products or their use to infringe the rights of any third parties, we cannot be certain that infringement has not or will not occur. We could incur substantial costs, in addition to a great amount of time lost, in defending any patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement suits or in asserting any patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights in a suit with another party. See Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nThe Endurance will make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled, have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flames. If such events occur in the Endurance, we could face liability for damage or injury, adverse publicity and a potential safety recall, any of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nThe battery packs in the Endurance will use lithium-ion cells, which have been used for years in laptop computers and cell phones. On rare occasions, if not appropriately managed and controlled, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials. This has occurred in our testing as we refine our software and other systems. Although we believe we can appropriately control this risk in our commercial vehicles for sale, there can be no assurance we will be able to entirely eliminate the risk. We could face liability for damage or injury, adverse publicity and a potential safety recall, any of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. To limit any losses associated with such event, we will carry commercial general liability, commercial automobile liability and umbrella insurance, which may not be adequate to ensure against all losses.\nWe may face legal challenges in one or more states in our attempting to sell directly to customers that could adversely affect our costs.\nOur business plan includes the direct sale of vehicles to commercial fleet operators and managers, and potentially, to retail consumers. The laws governing licensing of dealers and sales of motor vehicles vary from state to state. Most states require a dealer license to sell new motor vehicles within the state, and many states prohibit manufacturers from being a licensed dealer and directly selling new motor vehicles to retail consumers. We recently became a licensed dealer in California and anticipate that we may become a licensed dealer in additional states.\nWe may face legal challenges to this distribution model. For instance, in states where direct sales are not permitted, dealers and their lobbying organizations may complain to the government or regulatory agencies that we are acting in the capacity of a dealer without a license. In some states, regulators may restrict or prohibit us from directly providing warranty repair service, or from contracting with third parties who are not licensed dealers to provide warranty repair service. Because the laws vary from state to state, our distribution model must be carefully established and the sales and service process must be continually monitored for compliance with the various state requirements, which change from time to time. Regulatory compliance and likely challenges to the distribution model will add to the cost of our business.\nWe may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results, reputation and financial condition.\nAny product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. In the future, we may, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our electric vehicles or components (including our battery cells) prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls, whether caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us, Foxconn or our suppliers, would involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources, which could adversely affect our brand image in our target market and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nInsufficient warranty reserves to cover future warranty claims could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOnce our electric pickup trucks are in production and sold to the public, we will need to maintain warranty reserves to cover any warranty-related claims. If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover such future warranty claims, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We may become subject to significant and unexpected warranty expenses. There can be no assurances that then-existing warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims.\nWe intend to collect and process certain information about our customers and will be subject to various privacy and data protection laws.\nWe intend to collect and process certain information about our customers, in accordance with applicable law and our own privacy policies. Any failure by us to comply with our privacy policy or any federal, state or international privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages and other costs. A failure by any of our vendors or business partners to comply with contractual or legal obligations regarding the protection of information about our customers could carry similar consequences. Should we become subject to additional privacy or data protection laws, we may need to undertake compliance efforts that could carry a large cost. Although we take steps to protect the security of our customers\u2019 personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data security incident notification requirements if a third-party accesses or acquires the personal information of our customers without authorization or if we otherwise experience a data security incident or loss of customers\u2019 personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems could have negative effects on our business and future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, and could result in reduced demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand. Such a breach could also compromise or lead to a loss of protection of our intellectual property or trade secrets.\nInterruption or failure of, or unauthorized access to, our or the Endurance\u2019s information technology and communications systems could adversely affect our operating results and reputation.\nWe are currently developing information technology and communications systems to assist us in the management of our business. The production of our vehicles will require the development, maintenance and improvement of information technology and communications systems in the United States, which will include product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. The availability and effectiveness of operating our business will depend on these systems.\nIn addition, software, information technology and communications systems will be integral to the operation and functionality of the Endurance. The Endurance will be designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates to improve or update its functionality. Although these systems will be designed and tested for resiliency and security, they involve complex technologies, and we cannot be certain they will be entirely free from vulnerabilities.\nAs a result, all of these systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, data breaches, cyber-attacks, actual or threatened geopolitical conflict, war, fire, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and other attempts to harm our systems or the operation of Endurance vehicles. We cannot be certain that these systems or their required functionality will be effectively and timely developed, implemented and maintained, and any disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Any compromise of our proprietary information or of our systems or those of the Endurance could adversely affect our reputation and could result in lengthy interruptions to our ability to operate our business and our customers\u2019 ability to operate the Endurance.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\nWe are currently and may in the future be subject to, or become a party to, litigation, regulatory actions, and government investigations and inquiries. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us. See Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings below and in our subsequent filings with the SEC for additional information.\nThese proceedings and incidents may include claims for which we have no insurance coverage. While we currently carry commercial general liability, commercial automobile liability, excess liability, workers\u2019 compensation, cyber security and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies, coverage amounts are limited and we may not maintain as much insurance coverage as other OEMs do. In some cases, we may not maintain any insurance coverage at all.\nAdditionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be applicable to or sufficient to cover all current and future claims against us. Our insurers have raised and may in the future raise, defenses as to coverage of all or some of the claims and, in any event, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient. A loss that is uninsured or exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nThe Lordstown facility could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or other unpredictable events. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of the facility would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe currently plan for our electric vehicles to be assembled at a single facility, the Lordstown facility. Any prolonged disruption of operations at the Lordstown facility, whether due to technical, information systems, communication networks, strikes, accidents, weather conditions or other natural disaster, the COVID-19 pandemic, global instability, acts of war or otherwise, whether short- or long-term, would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, pursuant to the APA, we have the obligation to deliver the Lordstown facility to Foxconn in substantially similar operating state as of the effective date of the APA. Therefore, any adverse impacts to the facility are likely to cause a delay in the APA closing, financial exposure or perhaps termination of the APA.\nWe are or may be subject to risks associated with strategic alliances, joint ventures, or acquisitions.\nWe have and are in the process of and may from time to time consider entering into strategic alliances, including joint ventures, minority equity investments or other transactions with various third parties to further our business purpose, including the Foxconn Transactions and other potential relationships. These alliances could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, with non-performance by the third party and with increased expenses in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business. We may have limited ability to monitor or control the actions of these third parties and, to the extent any of these strategic third parties suffer negative publicity or harm to its reputation from events relating to its business, we may also suffer negative publicity or harm to our reputation by virtue of our association with any such third party.\nWhen appropriate opportunities arise, we may acquire additional assets, products, technologies, or businesses that are complementary to our existing business. In addition to possible stockholder approval, we may need approvals and licenses from relevant government authorities for the acquisitions and to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased delay and costs, and may disrupt our business strategy if we fail to do so. Furthermore, acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our\noperations. Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect. Acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of significant goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangible assets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of an acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and Being a Public Company\nThe concentration of ownership of our stock among a few large stockholders may limit your ability to influence significant corporate decisions.\nThe ownership by a few stockholders may account for a large percentage of our outstanding Class A common stock. For example, as of December 31, 2021, Stephen S. Burns, our former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, beneficially owned Class A common stock representing approximately 22.4% of our outstanding shares. Foxconn currently beneficially owns approximately 3.7% of Class A common stock and may increase its beneficial ownership. As long as Mr. Burns, other individuals or companies own or control a significant percentage of our outstanding voting power, they could have the ability to influence certain corporate actions requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors, any amendment of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d) and the approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in management and would make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these significant stockholders.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock or additional shares of Class A common stock, which would dilute the interest of our stockholders and could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nOur Charter provides for 312 million authorized shares of capital stock, consisting of (i) 300 million shares of Class A common stock and (ii) 12 million shares of preferred stock.\nTo raise capital, we may sell Class A common stock, preferred stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions, including those contemplated by the Equity Purchase Agreement, at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by our current stockholders, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. In particular, we may issue a substantial number of shares of preferred stock and/or additional shares of Class A common stock in connection with the Foxconn Transactions, a potential joint product development agreement and other contemplated transactions with Foxconn, our financing efforts and as compensation to our employees and directors. Any such issuance:\n\u25cf may significantly dilute the equity interest of our then-current stockholders;\n\u25cf may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of Class A common stock if one or more classes of preferred stock are created, and such preferred shares are issued, with rights senior to those afforded to our Class A common stock;\n\u25cf could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of Class A common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u25cf may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our Class A common stock.\nOn July 23, 2021, we entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement with YA, pursuant to which YA has committed to purchase up to $400 million in shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement. The shares of our Class A common stock that may be issued under the Purchase Agreement may be sold by us to YA at our\ndiscretion from time to time over an approximately 36-month period commencing on the date of the agreement. We generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares of Class A common stock to YA under the Equity Purchase Agreement. Future sales of our Class A common stock, if any, to YA under the Purchase Agreement will depend upon market conditions and other factors. Because the purchase price per share to be paid by YA for the shares of Class A common stock that we may elect to sell to YA under the Equity Purchase Agreement, if any, will fluctuate based on the market prices of our Class A common stock, it is not possible for us to predict the number of shares of Class A common stock that we will sell to YA under the Equity Purchase Agreement, the purchase price per share that YA will pay for shares purchased from us under the Equity Purchase Agreement, or the aggregate gross proceeds that we will receive from those purchases by YA under the Equity Purchase Agreement. The Equity Purchase Agreement is subject to certain limitations and conditions. In particular, at current market prices of our shares of Class A common stock, without stockholder approval, we cannot issue or sell to YA shares of our Class A common stock in excess of 35.1 million shares, which would limit the amount of funds we are able to raise to significantly less than the $400 million commitment under the Equity Purchase Agreement.\nWe may not have sufficient authorized shares to issue in connection with a future capital raise without shareholder approval. We intend to seek approval of an amendment to our Charter to increase the authorized number of shares of Class A common stock and preferred stock. No assurance can be given that our shareholders will approve an increase in authorized shares, that may result in our inability to raise adequate funds to execute our strategy.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our securities in the public market could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of Class A common stock in the public market could occur at any time, including sales pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement and resale registration statement covering such shares, the MOU, or other efforts to raise additional capital or in connection with a strategic alliance, business combination or similar transaction, as well as pursuant to a resale prospectus covering shares issued in the Business Combination and registered pursuant to the Registration Rights and Lock-up Agreement (defined below). These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock.\nAs of February 24, 2022, we had outstanding 196.5 million shares of our Class A common stock and Warrants to purchase approximately 3.9 million shares of our Class A common stock. The exercise price of the BGL Warrants is $10.00 per share and of the Private Placement Warrants is $11.50 per share. To the extent such Warrants are exercised, additional shares of our Class A common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our Class A common stock and will increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. In addition, as of February 24, 2022, an aggregate of 14.7 million shares of Class A common stock are subject to outstanding awards or available for future issuance under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2020 Plan\u201d). Sales, or the potential sales, of substantial numbers of shares in the public market, subject to certain restrictions on transfer until the termination of applicable lock-up periods, could increase the volatility of the market price of our Class A common stock or adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe Registration Rights and Lock-up Agreement (the \u201cRegistration Rights and Lock-up Agreement\u201d) that we entered into effective as of the Closing of the Business Combination provided that certain of our securities held by the parties to such agreement were locked-up, pursuant to which 50% of shares of Class A common stock held by Stephen S. Burns will continue be locked-up until October 23, 2022. In addition, Stephen S. Burns agreed not to transfer any shares of Class A common stock held by him if, immediately following such transfer, the shares owned by him would be fewer than the number of shares that would be required to satisfy any outstanding indemnification claim made by us pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is likely to be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we incur, preferred stock we may issue, or other agreements we may enter into. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A common stock unless you sell our Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. See Part I - Item 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividend Policy.\nOur stock price is volatile, and you may not be able to sell the shares of our Class A common stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been very volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf our ability to consummate the Foxconn Transactions or enter into additional agreements with Foxconn;\n\u25cf our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain adequate financing and on acceptable terms;\n\u25cf commencement of, or involvement in, investigations, inquiries or litigation;\n\u25cf our ability to complete the engineering and testing of the Endurance, start production and bring it to market on the expected timeline and budget;\n\u25cf changes in our operating results and funding needs;\n\u25cf success of our competitors;\n\u25cf our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the industries in which we operate in general;\n\u25cf stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u25cf our focus on long-term goals over short-term results;\n\u25cf the timing and magnitude of our investments in the growth of our business;\n\u25cf disputes or other developments related to our intellectual property or other proprietary rights, including litigation;\n\u25cf changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure, including future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u25cf the volume of shares of our Class A common stock available for public sale;\n\u25cf major changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. Trading of stock on a national securities exchange has experienced and is expected to continue to experience price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nIn addition, in the past, securities class action litigation has often been commenced against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of the particular company\u2019s securities. This type of litigation, which has been, and may in the future be, instituted against us, is likely to result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we currently have several litigation matters pending against us and current and former officers and directors of the Company and DiamondPeak. We intend to vigorously defend against the claims but there can be no assurances as to the outcome, costs, availability of insurance coverage and impact on our operating results, financial condition and prospects. See Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings below and in our subsequent filings with the SEC for additional information.\nWe incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company and our management may not successfully or effectively manage our transition to public company obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a mature public company that Legacy Lordstown did not incur as a private company. SEC rules and regulations, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the securities exchanges impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies that are complex and time-consuming.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). Because we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, and as certain extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies expire, we are subject to additional reporting requirements and standards and accelerated filing deadlines for our periodic reports.\nOur management team may not successfully or effectively manage our ongoing transition to a public company, and these significant obligations under federal securities laws. Our limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of management's time may be devoted to these activities which will result in less time being devoted to our management and growth. We currently do not, and in the future may not, have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal controls over financial reporting required of public companies in the United States. As part of our plan to remediate material weaknesses that have already been identified, we intend to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company that will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nFurthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, identifying a material weakness or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting, as we have already\nexperienced), we could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of us.\nIt is also more expensive to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, which we experienced in 2021, and risks associated with our status as a public company may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase our costs.\nThe additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations require us to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand our business and achieve strategic objectives. If we are unable to comply with and implement any changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting, or financial results. While we are taking steps to implement the systems and processes required to comply with these additional requirements, there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to date, and are continuing to implement, will enable us to comply fully and in a timely manner.\nFailure to timely implement and maintain adequate financial, information technology and management processes and controls and procedures have resulted and could in the future result in material weaknesses, leading to errors in our financial reporting and adversely affecting our business.\nWe are subject to the SEC\u2019s internal control over financial reporting requirements and are subject to the auditor attestation requirements as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year. The design of internal controls over financial reporting has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from management and other personnel.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our management identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting:\n\u25cf we did not have a sufficient number of trained resources with the appropriate technical accounting skills and knowledge with assigned responsibilities and accountability for the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u25cf we did not have an effective risk assessment process that successfully identified and assessed risks of material misstatement to ensure controls were designed and implemented to respond to those risks; and\n\u25cf we did not have an effective monitoring process to assess the consistent operation of internal control over financial reporting and to remediate known control deficiencies.\nA material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThese control deficiencies resulted in the restatement of our December 31, 2020 financial statements and our conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020.\nOur management prepared and implemented a remediation plan in 2021 under the oversight of the Audit Committee. The plan involved, among other actions, hiring and training additional qualified personnel, performing detailed risk assessments in key process areas to identify risks of material misstatement, further documentation and implementation of control procedures to address the identified risks of material misstatements in key process areas, and the implementation of monitoring activities over the components of our internal controls which would include holding personnel accountable to their responsibilities for the design and implementation of internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe made significant progress implementing our remediation plan during fiscal year 2021 as the design and implementation of relevant key controls occurred throughout the second half of the year. However, a material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time. Management has concluded, through testing, that the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting remained as of December 31, 2021: the Company did not have a sufficient number of trained resources with assigned responsibilities and accountability for the implementation and operation of internal controls over financial reporting.\nAs a consequence of the above material weakness, the Company did not effectively implement and operate process-level control activities related to procure-to-pay (including operating expenses, prepaid expenses, and accrued liabilities), review and approval of manual journal entries, and user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties.\nAccordingly, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021 and our independent registered public accounting firm was not able to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe plan to continue to hire and train additional qualified personnel and to test the effectiveness of the controls implemented pursuant to the remediation plan in order to conclude that they are operating effectively, however, there can be no assurance that this will occur within 2022 or that we will be successful in remediating the material weakness.\nIf not remediated, this material weakness could result in material misstatements to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that might not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or in delayed filing of required periodic reports. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of the Class A common stock could be adversely affected and we could become subject to litigation or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nFurther, additional weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in our implementation or improvement, could adversely affect our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq.\nOur Class A common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq. Our continued eligibility for listing may depend on, among other things, compliance with minimum price and corporate governance requirements and timely filings with the SEC. If Nasdaq delists our Class A common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the Nasdaq listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our Class A common stock is a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our Class A common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and could possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our Class A common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq, it is a covered security. Although states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who cover us provide negative recommendations or change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us were to cease its coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nProvisions in our Charter may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our Class A common stock, or otherwise may make it more difficult for certain provisions of the Charter to be amended.\nThe Charter contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include:\n\u25cf a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u25cf the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf restrictions on the right of stockholders to remove directors without cause; and\n\u25cf restrictions on the right of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders.\nThese provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nOur Charter designates state courts within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nThe Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any internal or intra-corporate claim or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine as defined by the laws of the State of Delaware, including, but not limited to (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders; or (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) or the Charter or our amended and restated bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) (in each case, as they may be amended from time to time), or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.\nIn addition, the Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district court for the District of Delaware (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction over such action, any other federal district court of the United States) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any action asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder (in each case, as amended), provided, however, that if the foregoing provisions are, or the application of such provisions to any person or entity or any circumstance is, illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the sole and exclusive forum for any action asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder (in each case, as amended) shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.\nThe Charter provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder (in each case, as amended), or any other claim over which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 18552, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "DPHC"}
