{"cik": "1011432", "company": "AUXILIO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nBefore deciding to purchase, hold or sell our Common Stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Auxilio, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price of our Common Stock will likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe face substantial competition from better established companies that may offer similar products and services at a lower cost to our customers, resulting in a reduction in the sale of our products and services.\nThe market for our products and services is competitive and is likely to become even more competitive in the future. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our products and services to achieve or maintain market acceptance, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as:\n\u00b7\ngreater name recognition and larger marketing budgets and resources;\n\u00b7\nestablished marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases;\n\u00b7\nsubstantially greater financial, technical and other resources; and\n\u00b7\nlarger technical and support staffs.\nAs a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. For all of the foregoing reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nWe are dependent upon our vendors to continue to supply us equipment, parts, supplies, and services at comparable terms and price levels as the business grows.\nOur access to equipment, parts, supplies, and services depends upon our relationships with, and our ability to purchase these items on competitive terms from our principal vendors. We rarely enter into long-term supply contracts with these vendors and we have no current plans to change this in the future. These vendors are not required to use us to distribute their equipment and are free to change the prices and other terms at which they sell to us. In addition, we compete with the selling efforts of some of these vendors. Significant deterioration in relationships with, or in the financial condition of, these significant vendors could have an adverse impact on our ability to sell equipment as well as our ability to provide effective service and technical support. If one of these vendors terminates or significantly curtails its relationship with us, or if one of these vendors ceases operations, we would be forced to expand our relationships with our existing vendors or seek out new relationships with previously unused vendors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA substantial portion of our business is dependent on our largest customers.\nThe loss of any key customer could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, business, prospects and results of operation. Our three largest customers represented approximately 42% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. We anticipate that these customers will represent approximately 40% of revenue for 2015; therefore the loss of one or more of these customers may contribute to our inability to operate as a going concern and may require us to obtain equity funding or debt financing to continue our operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nHealthcare legislation and regulation.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated. Recent legislation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 will likely change how healthcare services are provided and managed. In addition, legislation related to electronic medical records may impact our business. In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included incentives and penalties related to electronic medical records. For example, Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements will be less for providers who fail to use electronic medical records by 2015.\nThe use of electronic medical records does not necessarily mean a hospital\u2019s printing demands will decrease, but we cannot be sure whether this will be the case. Increased adoption and use of electronic medical records may negatively impact our business.\nNew legislation or regulation.\nAs to prospective legislation and regulation, we cannot determine what effect additional state or federal governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders would have on our business in the future. New legislation or regulation may require the reformulation of our business to meet new standards, require us to cease operations, impose stricter qualification and/or registration standards, impose additional record keeping, or require expanded consumer protection measures.\nWe may be unable to recruit and maintain our senior management and other key personnel on whom we are dependent.\nWe are highly dependent upon senior management and key personnel, and we do not carry any life insurance policies on such persons. The loss of any of our senior management, or our inability to attract, retain and motivate the additional highly-skilled employees and consultants that our business requires, could substantially hurt our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we rely on the ability of our management team to work together effectively. If our management team fails to work together effectively, our business could be harmed.\nThe market may not accept our products and services and we may not be able to continue our business operations; or if the market is receptive to our products but not our services, our revenues and profitability will be harmed.\nOur products and services are targeted to the healthcare market, a market in which there are many competing service providers. Accordingly, the demand for our products and services is very uncertain. The market may not accept our products and services. Even if our products and services achieve market acceptance, our products and services may fail to adequately address the market\u2019s requirements.\nIn addition, if we are able to sell our products but are unable to provide ongoing services, our revenues and profitability will be harmed. Our services are integral to the successful deployment of our solutions. If we do not effectively service and support our customers, our revenues and operating results would be harmed.\nDefects, errors or vulnerabilities in our solutions or the failure of our solutions to prevent a security breach could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results.\nDefects may cause our solutions to be vulnerable to security attacks, cause them to fail to help secure networks or temporarily interrupt customers\u2019 networking traffic. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, our solutions may not be able to protect our customers\u2019 networks. Our security solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses, worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our threat intelligence database or other virus databases in time to protect our customers\u2019 networks. In addition, defects or errors in our solutions could result in a failure to effectively update customers\u2019 solutions and thereby leave our customers vulnerable to attacks. Our facilities may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our customers\u2019 networks, leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats. Any defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our solutions could result in:\n\u00b7\nexpenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;\n\u00b7\nloss of existing or potential customers;\n\u00b7\ndelayed or lost revenue;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure to attain market acceptance;\n\u00b7\nnegative publicity, which will harm our reputation and brand;\n\u00b7\nan increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or an increased cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely affect our operating results; and\n\u00b7\nlitigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation and brand.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained or our customers experience data losses, our brand, reputation and business could be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur customers rely on our security solutions to secure their data, which may include financial records, credit card information, business information, customer information, health information, other personally identifiable information or other sensitive personal information. A breach of our network security and systems or other events that cause the loss or public disclosure of, or access by third parties to, our customers\u2019 stored files or data could have serious negative consequences for our business, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our solutions, an unwillingness of our customers to use our solutions, harm to our brand and reputation, and time-consuming and expensive litigation. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated or remote areas around the world. As a result, we may be unable to proactively prevent these techniques, implement adequate preventative or reactionary measures, or enforce the laws and regulations that govern such activities. If our customers experience any data loss, or any data corruption or inaccuracies, whether caused by security breaches or otherwise, our brand, reputation and business could be harmed. Moreover, if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another provider of information security services and solutions, our clients and potential clients may lose trust in the security of our business model generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems, our services may be perceived as not being secure and clients may curtail or stop using our solutions.\nAs a provider of network security solutions, we are a high profile target and our networks and solutions may have vulnerabilities that may be targeted by hackers and could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation. We will not succeed unless the marketplace continues to be confident that we provide effective network and security protection. If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems it could adversely affect the market perception of our solutions. We may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly, or at all. In addition, such a security breach could impair our ability to operate our business, including our ability to provide subscription and support services to our customers. If this happens, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nBecause our solutions could be used to protect personal information, privacy concerns could result in additional cost and liability to us or inhibit sales of our solutions.\nPersonal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in many other countries where we offer our solutions. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently complex and evolving, and it is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and state breach notification laws.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocacy and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is in conflict with one another, and is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our solutions. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and harm our business.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our solutions. Privacy concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our solutions particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.\nOur ability to sell our products and services is dependent on the quality of our technical support services, and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nOnce our products are deployed within our end-customers\u2019 networks, our end-customers depend on our technical support services, as well as the support of our channel partners, to resolve any issues relating to our products. If we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. Many large end-customers require higher levels of support than smaller end-customers because of their more complex deployments. If we fail to meet the requirements of our larger end-customers, it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with enterprises and other service providers.\nAs a result, our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAchieving the desired benefits of the acquisition of Delphiis, Inc. may be subject to a number of challenges and uncertainties which make it hard to predict the future success of each entity.\nWe acquired Delphiis, Inc. with expected benefits including, among other things, operating efficiencies, procurement savings, innovation, sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth. Achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of separate organizations, the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses and delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. We could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and, if such capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or available to us at all, this may impact our ability to continue to grow our business operations.\nWe may need capital in the future to expand our business operations. If we need capital, we cannot be certain that it will be available on terms acceptable to us or available to us at all. In the event we need to raise capital, we may not be able to:\n\u00b7\ndevelop or enhance our service offerings;\n\u00b7\ntake advantage of future opportunities; or\n\u00b7\nrespond to customers and competition.\nRisks Related to the Market for Our Securities\nBecause the public market for shares of our Common Stock is limited, stockholders may be unable to resell their shares of Common Stock.\nCurrently, there is only a limited public market for our Common Stock on the OTCBB and our stockholders may be unable to resell their shares of Common Stock. Currently, the average daily trading volume of our Common Stock is not significant, and it may be more difficult for you to sell your shares in the future, if at all.\nThe development of an active trading market depends upon the existence of willing buyers and sellers who are able to sell shares of our Common Stock as well as market makers willing to create a market in such shares. Under these circumstances, the market bid and ask prices for the shares may be significantly influenced by the decisions of the market makers to buy or sell the shares for their own account. Such decisions of the market makers may be critical for the establishment and maintenance of a liquid public market in our Common Stock. Market makers are not required to maintain a continuous two-sided market and are free to withdraw quotations at any time. We cannot assure our stockholders that an active public trading market for our Common Stock will develop or be sustained.\nThe price of our Common Stock may be volatile and could decline in value, resulting in loss to our stockholders.\nThe market for our Common Stock is volatile, having ranged in the last twelve months from a low of $0.81 to a high of $1.72 on the OTCBB. The market price for our Common Stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. The following factors may cause significant fluctuations in the market price of shares of our Common Stock:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in our quarterly revenues and earnings or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our operating results compared to levels expected by the investment community;\n\u00b7\nannouncements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations;\n\u00b7\nsale or purchases of shares by traders or other investors;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the industry; and\n\u00b7\nthe conditions of the securities markets.\nThe factors discussed above may depress or cause volatility of our share price, regardless of our actual operating results. In addition, the highly volatile nature of our stock price may cause investment losses for our stockholders. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. If securities class action litigation is brought against us, such litigation could result in substantial costs while diverting management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThere are a large number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued or sold, and if such shares are issued or sold, the market price of our Common Stock may decline.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 23,623,619 shares of our Common Stock outstanding.\nIf all warrants, options and restricted stock grants outstanding as of December 31, 2014 are exercised prior to their expiration, up to approximately 7.5 million additional shares of Common Stock could become freely tradable. Such sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of Common Stock. Additionally we have $257,835 in debt which was converted to stock in February 2015.\nOur stockholders approved a reverse stock split for our Common Stock at the 2014 Annual Meeting which, if effected, would have certain dilutive effects, among other effects, on our Common Stock\nAt the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved a reverse stock split at a ratio of not less than one-for-one-and-one-half (1:1.5) and not more than one-for-three (1:3) (the \u201cReverse Stock Split\u201d). The decision to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split is at the discretion of the Board of Directors. If the Reverse Stock Split is effected and the market price of our Common Stock declines, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of the Reverse Stock Split. The market price of our Common Stock will also be based on performance and other factors, which are unrelated to the number of shares outstanding.\nThere can be no assurance that the Reverse Stock Split will result in any particular price for our Common Stock. As a result, the trading liquidity of our Common Stock may not necessarily improve.\nThere can be no assurance that the market price per share of our Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split will increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding before the Reverse Stock Split. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the Reverse Stock Split. Moreover, in the future, the market price of our Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split may not exceed or remain higher than the market price prior to the Reverse Stock Split.\nBecause the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock would decrease as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock would increase on a relative basis. If we issue additional shares of Common Stock, the ownership interest of our current stockholders would be diluted, possibly substantially.\nThe proportion of unissued, authorized shares to issued shares could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover effect. For example, the issuance of a large block of Common Stock could dilute the stock ownership of a person seeking to effect a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or contemplating a tender offer or other transaction for the combination of Auxilio with another company. The Reverse Stock Split, however, was not proposed in response to any effort of which we are aware to accumulate shares of our Common Stock or obtain control of the Company, nor is it part of a plan by management to recommend a series of similar amendments to the Board of Directors and stockholders.\nThe Reverse Stock Split may result in some stockholders owning \u201codd lots\u201d of less than 100 shares of Common Stock. Odd lot shares may be more difficult to sell, and brokerage commissions and other costs of transactions in odd lots are generally somewhat higher than the costs of transactions in \u201cround lots\u201d of even multiples of 100 shares.\nSome investors may interpret the Reverse Stock Split as a signal that Auxilio lacks confidence in its ability to increase its stock price naturally.\nThere can be no assurances that our Common Stock will obtain qualification for listing on a national exchange on grounds other than the minimum share price requirement.\nOur Board of Directors intends to effect the Reverse Stock Split only if it believes that a decrease in the number of shares is likely to improve the trading price of our Common Stock and if the implementation of the Reverse Stock Split is determined by the Board of Directors to be in the best interests of Auxilio and its stockholders.\nIf our Common Stock is determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our Common Stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our Common Stock in the secondary market.\nOur Common Stock may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our Common Stock is determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our Common Stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our Common Stock on the secondary market.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock. We do not anticipate paying dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. We may not have sufficient funds to legally pay dividends. Even if funds are legally available to pay dividends, we may nevertheless decide in our sole discretion not to pay dividends and to retain any future earnings to fund growth.\nOther Risks\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nSome provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws, as well as some provisions of Nevada or California law, may discourage, delay or prevent third parties from acquiring us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nAs a public company, we are subject to complex legal and accounting requirements that will require us to incur significant expenses.\nAs a public company, we are subject to numerous legal and accounting requirements that do not apply to private companies. The cost of compliance with many of these requirements is material, not only in absolute terms but, more importantly, in relation to the overall scope of the operations of a small company. The cost of such compliance may prove to be a substantial competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis our privately held and larger public competitors.\nThe impact of any deterioration of the global credit markets, financial services industry and U.S. economy may negatively affect our business and our ability to obtain capital, if needed.\nA deterioration in the global credit markets, the financial services industry and the U.S. economy could result in a period of substantial turmoil. The impact of these events on our business and the severity of an economic crisis is uncertain. It is possible that a crisis in the global credit markets, the financial services industry or the U.S. economy could adversely affect our business, vendors and prospects as well as our liquidity and financial condition. This could impact our ability to increase our customer base and generate positive cash flows. Although we were able to raise additional working capital through convertible note agreements and private placement offerings of our Common Stock, we may not be able to continue this practice in the future or we may not be able to obtain additional working capital through other debt or equity financings. In the event that sufficient capital cannot be obtained, we may be forced to minimize growth to a point that would be detrimental to our business development activities. These courses of action may be detrimental to our business prospects and result in material charges to our operations and financial position. In the event that any future financing should take the form of the sale of equity securities, the current equity holders may experience dilution of their investments.\nThe forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report may prove incorrect.\nThis Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based largely on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. In addition to the other risks described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d discussion, important factors to consider in evaluating such forward-looking statements include: (i) changes to external competitive market factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations; (ii) anticipated working capital or other cash requirements; (iii) changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in our industry; and (iv) various competitive factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace. In light of these risks and uncertainties, many of which are described in greater detail elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d discussion, there can be no assurance that the events predicted in forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report will, in fact, transpire. Any negative change in the factors listed above could adversely affect the financial condition and operating results of the Company and its products and services.", "PERMNO": 16915, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "CTEK"}
