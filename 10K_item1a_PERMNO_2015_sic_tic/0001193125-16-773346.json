RISK FACTORS\nIn conjunction with evaluating an investment in the Company and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time, you should carefully read the following risk factors. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses.\nOverall Economic and Supply/Demand Conditions, Customer Vitality-A weakening economy or product supply versus demand imbalance in markets in which the Company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues, operating results, and cash flows. Cyclical downturns in the industries served by our customers or adverse economic events or conditions affecting specific customers can in turn have an adverse effect on our business.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which the Company does business. In the past few years, uncertain economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in markets served by the Company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, in turn negatively impacting the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or to a particular customer, affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility, impact utilization of the Company\u2019s manufacturing capacity, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. Excess capacity in the Company\u2019s or its competitors\u2019 manufacturing facilities could decrease the Company\u2019s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits.\nOur operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. A decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to the Company, resulting in uncollected receivables, unanticipated contract terminations, project delays, or inability to recover plant investments negatively impacting our financial results.\nWeak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause elimination of product lines, customer shutdowns or default, or other inabilities to profitably operate facilities and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or projects not to reach on-stream. These or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market, product, or customer events may require the Company to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on its financial results.\nOperational, Economic, Political, and Legal Risks of International Operations-The Company\u2019s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political and legal risks that could impact our profitability. Developing market operations present special risks.\nThe Company has extensive international operations. In addition, the Company is actively investing significant capital and other resources in emerging markets, including joint ventures and other alliances. The Company\u2019s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to project delays due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, or political instability. Some of the Company\u2019s contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss. Economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, nationalization and expropriation risk, social unrest, strained relations between countries, or imposition of international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nOur developing market operations may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including geopolitical, legal, economic, and talent risks. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability\nto manage the risks inherent in operating in a developing market, including unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences, and tailoring products for acceptance by local markets.\nFurther, our operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations, including anti-corruption laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, as well as U.S. and international economic sanctions. We have policies and procedures to foster compliance with these laws, including compliance and training programs for our employees and established due diligence procedures with regard to third parties; however, these cannot eliminate the risk that violations could be committed by our employees, agents or joint venture partners. Violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of the Company, significant fines and sanctions which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.\nCurrency Fluctuations-Changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from sales outside the United States, exposing it to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our Industrial Gases business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of its foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. Our Performance Materials business is also significantly exposed to transactional currency impacts as many of its products are manufactured in one country and sold in another.\nThe Company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate some of these effects. The Company\u2019s policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. The Company chooses not to hedge the translation of its foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings into dollars. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see Item 7A, below.\nRaw Material and Energy Cost and Availability-Interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.\nHydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. Energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of the Company\u2019s business. Because the Company\u2019s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, energy price fluctuations could materially impact the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings. A disruption in the supply of energy, components, or raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, natural events, or other disruption, could prevent the Company from meeting its contractual commitments, harming its business and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers. Lower natural gas production (which may result from natural gas pricing or supplier operating issues) or interruptions in sales from other crude helium suppliers, can reduce the Company\u2019s supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to its customers.\nThe Company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers, but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results. The Company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery. Increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings. Even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.\nRegulatory Compliance-The Company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business. Changes in regulations addressing, among other things, environmental compliance, import/export restrictions, anti-bribery and corruption, and taxes, can negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to government regulation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business. The application of laws and regulations to the Company\u2019s business is sometimes unclear.\nCompliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. Determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results. Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs. Export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the Company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. Export restrictions continue to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement authorities. Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the Company\u2019s businesses. Increasingly aggressive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, could subject the Company to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation occurs.\nEnvironmental Compliance-Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nThe Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. The Company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the Company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs may adversely affect financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see \u201cNarrative Description of the Company\u2019s Business Generally-Environmental Controls,\u201d above.\nWe may not be able to successfully control or reduce costs to improve productivity and streamline operations. Reorganization and cost reduction efforts can disrupt operations.\nAchieving our financial goals including continued profitability and margin growth depends significantly on our efforts to control or reduce our operating costs, including our ability to eliminate stranded costs related to our divested businesses. Because many of our costs are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control, we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency and repositioning actions. If we are not able to identify and execute efforts designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, our ability to attain our goals could be adversely impacted.\nOngoing restructuring and cost reduction actions may reduce our available talent and other resources, impact our ability to attract and retain key employees, slow improvements in our products and services, and adversely affect our ability to respond to customers. Failure to achieve targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions. These circumstances could adversely impact our business and financial statements.\nInterest Rate Increases-The Company\u2019s earnings, cash flows, and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases and access to credit.\nAt 30 September 2016, the Company had total consolidated debt of $6,225.2 million (including Versum debt of $997.2 million), of which $1,307.1 million (including Versum debt of $5.8 million) will mature in the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt. Although the Company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations, not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged, and new debt will be priced at market rates. If interest rates increase, the Company\u2019s interest expense could increase significantly, affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other purposes. In addition, changes by any rating agency to the Company\u2019s outlook or credit ratings could increase the Company\u2019s cost of borrowing and weaken our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. For a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk, see Item 7A, below.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In\naddition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses to meet expected returns, the failure to integrate acquired businesses, the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections or insurance. With respect to divested businesses, our results may be impacted by claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.\nCatastrophic Events-Catastrophic events could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial results, and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the Company\u2019s control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, or acts of war and terrorism. Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the Company\u2019s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact the Company\u2019s suppliers or customers, in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the Company, or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the Company\u2019s products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nOperational Risks-Operational and execution risks may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations or financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s operation of its facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, or vehicle accidents. If operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flows. In addition, the Company\u2019s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements, which depends, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets. Operating results are also dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget, and in accordance with performance requirements, which depends, in part, on the availability of adequate sources of labor in the geographies where the Company intends to build new plants. Failure to do so may expose the Company to loss of revenue, potential litigation, and loss of business reputation.\nInformation Security-The security of the Company\u2019s Information Technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect its ability to operate.\nWe depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. Our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and services providers. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information or multiple site impact through a security breach. As with all large systems, our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, disrupting business processes, or causing harm to persons or property. The Company\u2019s systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to sophisticated cyber security threats. To date, the Company is not aware of any significant impact on its operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about its employees, vendors, and customers. The protection of such information, as well as the Company\u2019s information, is critical to the Company. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. The Company has established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. The Company also, from time to time, exports sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception,\ncould expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\nLitigation and Regulatory Proceedings-The Company\u2019s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.\nThe Company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. While the Company seeks to limit its liability in its commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable at law. Also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the Company\u2019s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any particular period.\nGreenhouse Gases-Legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk.\nSome of the Company\u2019s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, California\u2019s cap and trade scheme, Alberta\u2019s Emission Reduction Program, China\u2019s Emission Trading Scheme pilots, South Korea\u2019s Emission Trading Scheme, and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions under an Ontario cap and trade scheme, nation-wide expansion of the China Emission Trading Scheme, and federal emission performance standards in Canada. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. Moreover, some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector (e.g. U.S. EPA Clean Power Plan) to achieve emission reductions. These reductions often result in higher power costs.\nIncreased public concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase the Company\u2019s costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. The Company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through its contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact on the Company. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could impact the Company\u2019s growth, increase its operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of its products.\nThe results of the United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cUK\u201d) European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) membership referendum could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements.\nThe results of the UK\u2019s EU membership referendum, advising for the exit of the UK from the EU, has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty, which could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements.\nCompetition-Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.\nThe Company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of its business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the Company\u2019s products, negatively impacting financial results. In addition, competitors\u2019 pricing policies could affect the Company\u2019s profitability or its market share.\nWe could incur significant liability if the distribution of Versum common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.\nWe have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the spin-off of Versum qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Versum and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the IRS could determine on audit that the spin-off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. If the spin-off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.", "PERMNO": 28222, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "APD"}
