The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Summary:\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to our Proposed Acquisition by AstraZeneca\n\u2022Our proposed acquisition by AstraZeneca is subject to various closing conditions and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.\n\u2022Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results.\n\u2022If the merger agreement is terminated, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee to AstraZeneca.\n\u2022Because the exchange ratio is fixed and the market price of shares of AstraZeneca stock fluctuates our stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive in the merger.\n\u2022While the merger is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect our operating results or result in a loss of employees, customers, collaborators or suppliers.\n\u2022Lawsuits may be filed against us and/or AstraZeneca challenging the merger. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may delay or prevent the proposed acquisition from being completed.\n\u2022We may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the merger.\nRisks Related to Revenue Concentration and Conversion\n\u2022If we are unable to continue to increase revenues from sales of our C5 complement inhibitors, our business would be materially harmed.\n\u2022If we are unable to achieve our conversion objectives of patients from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS, our business may be harmed. In addition, even if we are successful, due to the pricing of ULTOMIRIS, our revenues may decrease unless we are able to increase the number of patients using our C5 inhibitors.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\u2022Our business may be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Pricing and Reimbursement\n\u2022Sales of our products depend on reimbursement by payers and these payers are subject to pressures to contain costs.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\u2022If we cannot obtain new patents, maintain our existing patents and protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\n\u2022If we are found to be infringing third party patents, we may be forced to pay damages and/or obtain a license. If we cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from the manufacture, sale or development of our products or product candidates.\n\u2022It is possible that we could lose market exclusivity for a product earlier than expected.\nRisks Related to Our Products and Product Candidates\n\u2022Our future commercial success depends on gaining regulatory approval for new products and obtaining approvals for existing products for new indications.\n\u2022Our products and product candidates target diseases with small patient populations and we may not be effective at identifying patients.\n\u2022We may not be able to gain or maintain market acceptance of our products among the medical community, patients or payers.\n\u2022If our products harm patients, or are perceived to harm patients, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.\n\u2022We anticipate that we will face increased competition from companies that will enter into the markets we currently serve and as we enter new markets.\nRisks Related to Business Operations\n\u2022We rely on a limited number of facilities to produce our products and manufacturing issues at these facilities could cause product shortages, interrupt commercialization of our products, disrupt or delay our clinical trials or regulatory approvals, and adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We rely on a limited number of providers for our raw materials and supply chain services.\n\u2022Counterfeit versions of our products could result in significant harm to patients, reduced sales of our products and harm to our reputation.\n\u2022If we are unable to establish and maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products.\n\u2022Our efforts to expand our business and product offerings through acquisitions may not be successful.\n\u2022The acquired business of Portola may underperform relative to our expectations, and we may not be able to integrate the business and achieve anticipated synergies.\n\u2022In order to support potential growth of the business, we will be required to make significant investments in our business operations.\n\u2022Completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee advancement of development, regulatory approval or successful commercialization.\n\u2022Our clinical studies may be costly and lengthy, and there are many reasons why drug testing could be delayed or terminated.\n\u2022We expect our operating results to fluctuate.\n\u2022We cannot guarantee that we will achieve our financial goals, including our ability to maintain profitability in the future.\n\u2022If we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize our products or products candidates.\n\u2022We may not achieve the expected benefits of our current and future restructuring plans and restructurings may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022If we fail to satisfy our debt service obligations or our contingent obligations, we may be unable to commercialize our products or continue or complete our product development.\n\u2022We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us or at all\n\u2022We have incurred significant impairment charges, and may continue to incur such charges in the future and such amounts may be material.\n\u2022The efficiency of our corporate structure depends on the application of the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities or our effective tax rate could increase, which could have a material impact on our financial results and position.\n\u2022Our sales and operations are subject to risks relating to our international business.\n\u2022Our business involves environmental risks and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\n\u2022Currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could adversely affect our revenue, increase our costs and negatively affect our profitability.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\n\u2022We operate in a highly regulated industry and if we or our third-party providers fail to comply with U.S. and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market our products.\n\u2022Our product candidates require extensive clinical testing and failure to satisfy regulatory requirements may prevent us from being able to market our products and limit our ability to grow our business and diversify our revenue.\n\u2022If we fail to comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations we may be subject to investigations and civil or criminal penalties and our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Our business could be adversely affected by litigation, regulatory enforcement actions and government investigations.\n\u2022Changes in healthcare laws and regulations, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may affect coverage and reimbursement of our products and these changes could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\u2022If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under governmental\npricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines.\n\u2022The Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program, and other comparable government and payer regulations, may have a negative impact on the price we can charge for our products and result in a decrease in revenues.\n\u2022We may be subject to numerous and varying privacy and security laws, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.\n\u2022Security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions could expose us to liability and affect our business and reputation.\n\u2022Negative public opinion of recombinant and transgenic products, genetically modified products and animals may damage public perception of our KANUMA product.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022Our stock price is volatile.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult and may frustrate any attempt to remove our current management.\n\u2022The exclusive forum provision in our bylaws could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain an alternate judicial forum for disputes with us.\nRisk Factors:\nRisks Related to our Proposed Acquisition by AstraZeneca\nOur proposed acquisition by AstraZeneca is subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder approvals as well as other uncertainties, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.\nOn December 12, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement), with AstraZeneca, Delta Omega Sub Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca (Bidco), Delta Omega Sub Holdings Inc. 1, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco (Merger Sub I) and Delta Omega Sub Holdings LLC 2, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco (Merger Sub II). Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub I will merge with and into Alexion (the First Merger) with Alexion surviving the First Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bidco and, immediately\nfollowing the effective time of the First Merger (the Effective Time), Alexion will merge with and into Merger Sub II (the Second Merger and, together with the First Merger, the \u201cMergers\u201d), with Merger Sub II surviving the Second Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca. Upon completion of the Mergers, each outstanding share of Alexion common stock, other than certain excluded shares (as described forth in the Merger Agreement) and shares held by stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law, will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive (1) 2.1243 American depositary shares of AstraZeneca (or, at the election of the holder thereof, a number of ordinary shares of AstraZeneca equal to the number of underlying ordinary shares represented by such American depositary shares) and (2) $60.00 in cash, without interest (the Merger Consideration).\nCompletion of the Mergers is subject to customary closing conditions, and it is possible that such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the Mergers. These conditions include, among other things: (1) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Alexion\u2019s stockholders (2) approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by AstraZeneca\u2019s shareholders; (3) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the Mergers; (4) AstraZeneca\u2019s registration statement on Form having been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission; (5) AstraZeneca\u2019s shareholder circular (or, if required, prospectus) having been approved by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority; (6) the American depository shares of AstraZeneca issuable in the Mergers (and the ordinary shares of AstraZeneca represented thereby) having been approved for listing on the Nasdaq; (7) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (\u201cHSR Act\u201d), as amended, and the approval of the Mergers under the antitrust and foreign investment laws of other specified jurisdictions; (8) accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement and (9) compliance by the other party in all material respects with such other party\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nThe governmental authorities from which authorizations under antitrust and foreign investment laws, including the HSR Act, are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations, and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the Mergers, including other potential transactions in the pharmaceutical industry or other industries. These governmental authorities may initiate proceedings\nseeking to prevent, or otherwise seek to prevent, the Mergers. As a condition to authorization of the Mergers or related transactions, these governmental authorities also may impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of AstraZeneca\u2019s business after completion of the Mergers. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the parties have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to complete the Mergers as promptly as reasonably practicable, including in obtaining each third party consent or regulatory approval necessary, proper or advisable to complete the Mergers, and AstraZeneca has agreed to (1) propose, negotiate, commit to, or effect any divestiture, (2) terminate, unwind, divest or assign, subcontract or otherwise secure substitute parties for relationships, ventures, and contractual or commercial rights or obligations, and (3) take any such other remedial action, in each case to permit the closing of the Mergers to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable.\nWe can provide no assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the Mergers. Many of the conditions to completion of the Mergers are not within either our or AstraZeneca\u2019s control, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in completing the Mergers could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Mergers are successfully completed within its expected timeframe.\nFailure to complete the Mergers could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results.\nIf the Mergers are not completed for any reason, including as a result of our stockholders failing to adopt the Merger Agreement or AstraZeneca shareholders failing to approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, we will remain an independent public company. Our ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on trading prices of our common stock, and from our customers, collaborators, suppliers, regulators and employees;\n\u2022we may be required to pay AstraZeneca a termination fee of $1,180.0 if the Merger\nAgreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including in the event Alexion\u2019s board of directors changes its recommendation in favor of the Mergers or if Alexion terminates the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an agreement providing for a superior proposal, and $270.0 if the Merger Agreement is terminated because the Mergers are not adopted by Alexion stockholders;\n\u2022the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Mergers, and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of AstraZeneca, may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, entering into or amending certain contracts, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Mergers that we would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place; and\n\u2022matters relating to the Mergers (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nIn addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Mergers or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce our performance obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nIf any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results and stock prices.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to AstraZeneca.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances, including in the event Alexion\u2019s board of directors changes its recommendation in favor of the Mergers or if Alexion terminates the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an agreement providing for a superior proposal, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $1,180.0 to AstraZeneca. In addition, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $270.0 if the Merger Agreement is terminated because the Mergers are not adopted by Alexion stockholders. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under such circumstances, the termination fee we may be required to pay under the Merger Agreement may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general\ncorporate purposes and other uses. For these and other reasons, termination of the Merger Agreement could materially adversely affect our business operations and financial results, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nBecause the exchange ratio is fixed and the market price of shares of AstraZeneca stock has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, our stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the Merger Consideration they will receive in the Mergers.\nUpon completion of the Mergers, each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive $60.00 in cash without interest thereon and 2.1243 American depositary shares of AstraZeneca (or, at the election of the holder thereof, a number of ordinary shares of AstraZeneca equal to the number of underlying ordinary shares represented by such American depositary shares). Because the exchange ratio of 2.1243 American depositary shares of AstraZeneca is fixed, the value of the share consideration will depend on the market price of shares of American depository shares of AstraZeneca at the time the Mergers are completed. The market price of American depositary shares of AstraZeneca has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the Mergers and will continue to fluctuate from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K until the date the Mergers are completed, which could occur a considerable amount of time after the date hereof. AstraZeneca\u2019s American depository share price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in AstraZeneca\u2019s and Alexion\u2019s respective businesses, operations and prospects, risks inherent in their respective businesses, changes in market assessments of the likelihood that the Mergers will be completed and/or the value that may be generated by the Mergers, and changes with respect to expectations regarding the timing of the Mergers and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nWhile the Mergers are pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial position and/or cash flows or result in a loss of employees, customers, collaborators or suppliers.\nThe Merger Agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the earlier of the completion of the Mergers or termination of the Merger Agreement, generally requiring us to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct our business in all material respects in the ordinary course. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we are subject to a variety of specified restrictions. Unless we obtain AstraZeneca\u2019s prior\nwritten consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and except (i) as required or expressly contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) as prohibited or required by applicable law or (iii) as set forth in the confidential disclosure schedule delivered by Alexion to AstraZeneca, we may not, among other things and subject to certain exceptions and aggregate limitations, incur additional indebtedness, issue additional shares of our common stock outside of our equity incentive plans, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends, acquire assets, securities or property, dispose of businesses or assets, enter into material contracts or make certain additional capital expenditures. We may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement delay or prevent us from responding, or limit our ability to respond, effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period, even if our management believes they may be advisable. The pendency of the Mergers may also divert management\u2019s attention and our resources from ongoing business and operations.\nOur employees, customers, collaborators and suppliers may experience uncertainties about the effects of the Mergers. It is possible that some customers, collaborators, suppliers and other parties with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the Mergers. Similarly, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the Mergers, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact our operating results, financial position and/or cash flows and/or our stock price.\nLawsuits may be filed against us and/or AstraZeneca challenging the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may delay or prevent the proposed acquisition from being completed.\nLawsuits arising out of or relating to the Merger Agreement, AstraZeneca\u2019s registration statement on Form (which will include a document that serves as a prospectus of AstraZeneca and a proxy statement of Alexion) and/or the proposed acquisition of us by AstraZeneca may be filed in the future. One of the conditions to completion of the Mergers is the absence of any injunction or other order being in effect that prohibits completion of the Mergers. Accordingly, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction, then such order may prevent the proposed acquisition from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe.\nWe may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the Mergers.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Mergers on our employees may have an adverse effect on our business. This uncertainty may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Mergers, as our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles in the combined business. No assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employees to the same extent that we have been able to attract or retain employees in the past.\nRisks Related to Revenue Concentration and Conversion\nWe depend on revenue from sales of our C5 complement inhibitors and, if we are unable to continue to increase revenues from sales of our C5 complement inhibitors, our business would be materially harmed and our future operating results may be adversely impacted.\nSince 2007, our revenue has depended primarily on the sales of SOLIRIS, a C5 complement inhibitor with a 2-week dosing schedule. In December 2018, we obtained our first regulatory approval in the U.S. to sell ULTOMIRIS, a long-acting C5 complement inhibitor, with an 8-week dosing schedule (and in 2020 we obtained approval in the U.S. and Europe for a 100mg/mL formulation of ULTOMIRIS). Our C5 complement inhibitors accounted for 84.7% of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Unless we are able to develop or acquire and commercialize new products beyond these C5 complement inhibitors, and/or materially increase sales of STRENSIQ, KANUMA and ANDEXXA\u00ae (our other approved products), we will remain dependent on sales of SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS as a source of our revenue. We expect our revenues for 2021 will continue to depend on our ability to sell our C5 complement inhibitors.\nThe commercial success of our C5 complement inhibitors and our ability to generate revenue depends on several factors, including: the safety and efficacy of our C5 complement inhibitors; coverage or reimbursement by government or third-party payers for our C5 complement inhibitors; pricing for our complement inhibitors; the analysis by doctors, payers and patients of the cost of our C5 complement inhibitors relative to the perceived benefits; manufacturing and uninterrupted supply; the introduction and success of competing products (including novel products and biosimilars to SOLIRIS); the size of patient populations and the number of patients diagnosed who may be treated with our C5 complement inhibitors; the impact of legal, administrative, regulatory or legislative developments\nthat impact the price or use of C5 complement inhibitors; and our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our C5 complement inhibitors for new indications. Any of these or other factors may cause revenues from sales of our C5 complement inhibitors to decrease, which would harm our business results.\nWhile SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS are studied for indications beyond those currently approved by regulatory authorities and ULTOMIRIS is being studied for subcutaneous administration, there is no guarantee that we can obtain regulatory approval or achieve any commercial sales of SOLIRIS or ULTOMIRIS for such other indications or for subcutaneous administration of ULTOMIRIS. Nor can we guarantee that, even if regulatory approval is obtained for such additional indications and routes of administration, physicians and patients will accept SOLIRIS or ULTOMIRIS as a treatment for such indications or means of administration, or that payers will pay for or reimburse the costs of these therapies.\nIf we are not able to maintain revenues from sales of SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS, or such revenues decrease, our operating results would be negatively impacted and our ability to fund research and development, commercialize or acquire new products would be harmed, which would limit our ability to diversify our revenue base and our stock price could be adversely affected. In addition, as a result of having our revenue concentrated in SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS, our future revenues and results of operations can be significantly harmed by, among other factors, the introduction of one or more biosimilar products or other competitive products that treat the same indications, adverse developments in the commercialization and sale of our C5 inhibitors or a change in reimbursement policies by payers for the C5 complement inhibitors. For example, a biosimilar has been introduced in Russia and a CD19-directed cytolytic antibody treatment and an IL-6R antibody, were both recently approved for NMOSD patients in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions.\nWe aim to facilitate the conversion of patients from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS. If we are unable to achieve our conversion objectives, our business may be harmed. In addition, even if we are successful, due to the pricing of ULTOMIRIS, our revenues may decrease unless we are able to increase the number of patients using our C5 inhibitors.\nULTOMIRIS has been approved for patients with PNH and aHUS in certain jurisdictions, including in the U.S., Europe and Japan.\nOne of our principal business objectives is to facilitate the conversion of PNH and aHUS patients from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS. While clinical trials in PNH patients demonstrated that ULTOMIRIS is non-inferior to SOLIRIS at an 8 week dosing interval\n(compared to a 2 week dosing interval for SOLIRIS), existing patients taking SOLIRIS for PNH or aHUS and their physicians may decline to switch to ULTOMIRIS. If we are unable to facilitate conversion to ULTOMIRIS prior to the loss of intellectual property or regulatory exclusivities for SOLIRIS, our future revenues could be adversely impacted if we were to face biosimilar competition for SOLIRIS. If ULTOMIRIS is approved as an indication for NMOSD and gMG, we will commence efforts to facilitate conversion of those SOLIRIS patients to ULTOMIRIS upon approval.\nWe have established what we believe is a globally sustainable and durable pricing strategy for ULTOMIRIS that is intended to facilitate such patient conversions (for example, in the U.S. the cost of current labeled maintenance therapy for ULTOMIRIS for adult PNH patients of average weight, represents on an annual basis an approximate 10% decrease relative to the cost of SOLIRIS). However, in the first year of PNH conversion to ULTOMIRIS, due to the loading doses required, there is an approximate 10% premium to the cost of SOLIRIS. We have also priced ULTOMIRIS for patients with aHUS in the U.S. at a cost relative to the cost of SOLIRIS for patients with aHUS in the U.S. that is approximately 30% less on an annual basis for an average adult patient on maintenance therapy (unlike PNH, the cost in the first year of aHUS conversion to ULTOMIRIS is approximately 20% less than the cost of SOLIRIS). If we achieve our goal of facilitating the conversion of patients from SOLIRIS (which accounted for approximately $4,064.2, or 67.0%, of our revenues in 2020) to ULTOMIRIS, due to the reduction in annual cost we anticipate that U.S. revenue attributable to each patient that converts from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS will decrease on an annual basis. In addition, as a result of the decreased cost for ULTOMIRIS relative to SOLIRIS on a per patient basis, in order to maintain or increase C5 complement inhibitor revenues in the future as we succeed in converting patients from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS, we must increase the total number of patients utilizing SOLIRIS, including gMG and NMOSD patients, and ULTOMIRIS.\nFinally, as a result of patient conversion from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS, we expect variability in our revenues in future quarters due to the extended ULTOMIRIS dosing interval and infusion timing which may result in either one or two infusions in a quarter.\nDue to the decision to price ULTOMIRIS lower than SOLIRIS on an annual basis, we anticipate U.S. revenues will be unfavorably impacted by the lower annual cost per patient in maintenance years, with the impact more pronounced for aHUS due to the greater decrease in vials for aHUS ULTOMIRIS patients.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business may be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business could be adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where we have operations, sales or other business activities, including regions where we have offices, manufacturing facilities, clinical trial sites and where our third party manufacturers, vendors and suppliers operate and where patients and potential patients are located. The outbreak of a novel strain of virus, which causes the disease called COVID-19, has evolved into a global pandemic. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and financial results is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, which cannot be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, future spikes in cases, additional or modified government actions, new information that will emerge concerning the severity and impact of the coronavirus and the actions taken to address its impact, among others.\nIn May 2020, we initiated a global Phase III study to investigate ULTOMIRIS in a subset of adults with COVID-19, who are hospitalized with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. In January 2021, we paused further enrollment in this study based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), following review of data from a pre-specified interim analysis. The IDMC recommended that additional enrollment be paused, pending further analysis of the data, due to lack of efficacy when ULTOMIRIS was added to best supportive care, compared to best supportive care alone. At this time, we cannot guarantee that the further analysis of study data would cause us to commence additional enrollment in the trial.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business and results of operations, including:\n\u2022Government and healthcare policies and federal, state, local or foreign regulations to address the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our sales and revenue. Due to quarantines, travel restrictions, hospital policies and patient concerns regarding exposure to COVID-19, we have observed fewer patient/doctor interactions, we have also noted that the new patient productivity and initiation queue has decreased since the COVID-19 outbreak (particularly in our neurological indications) and our representatives are having fewer in-person visits with health care providers, including for infusion of our products which has adversely impacted our revenue growth in the current\nyear and may continue to affect our revenue growth in the future. A decrease in the demand of our products could cause our cost of goods sold to increase due to expiration of inventory on hand, an increase in manufacturing overhead allocated to inventory sold and other factors. Our net product sales could also be adversely impacted by the negative effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the global economy, which could result in (i) an increased number of patients utilizing our patient access programs to receive free drug due to loss of employer-based health insurance, or other factors impacting their ability to afford our medicines\u037e and (ii) patients increasingly seeking Medicaid coverage for our products, which would lead to higher gross-to-net revenue reductions compared to commercial insurance providers. We are monitoring the impacts on our business of the growth in unemployment and loss of commercial insurance coverage and/or growth in Medicaid with higher discounts.\n\u2022Due to financial demands in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, payors have requested and may continue to request extended credit terms, may extend payment dates beyond those experienced in the past, or may not be able to timely reimburse us for our products or at all, and such actions could have a material adverse impact on our cashflow from operations. Additionally, federal and state governments and foreign jurisdictions where we operate could increase tax rates to offset the economic impact and cost of addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Any increase in such tax rates could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on various aspects of our clinical programs and trials. For example, our Phase I trial for ALXN1720 are currently paused (for the second time) due to COVID-19. Patient dosing and study monitoring in other trials may be paused, delayed or temporarily halted (and clinical trial re-start schedules may be delayed beyond the dates we anticipated) due to changes in policies at various clinical sites and federal, state, local or foreign laws, rules and regulations, including quarantines or other travel restrictions, prioritization of healthcare resources toward pandemic efforts, including diminished attention of physicians serving as our clinical trial investigators and reduced availability of site staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials, or other reasons related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period of time, other aspects of our clinical trials may be adversely affected, delayed or interrupted, including, for example, site initiation, patient recruitment and enrollment, availability of clinical trial materials, and data analysis. Some patients and clinical investigators may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols and patients may choose to withdraw from our studies, or we may choose to or be required to pause enrollment and/or patient dosing in our ongoing clinical trials in order to preserve health resources and protect trial participants. Any such disruption could negatively impact the results generated in the trial, the development of our pipeline programs and the timing and probability of paying milestones associated with prior acquisitions and active license agreements (which may lead to litigation over milestone payments).\n\u2022We currently utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture our products and product candidates, supply raw materials and consumables, perform quality testing and provide supply chain services. We also manufacture certain of our products and product candidates and perform various services at our manufacturing facilities. If any of these processes or services are adversely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, our ability to manufacture and supply our products to patients or manufacture product candidates for our clinical trials and conduct our research and development operations may be materially affected. For example, if the U.S. government invokes the Defense Production Act, including as part of Operation Warp Speed, to redirect capacity at our third-party suppliers toward COVID-19 vaccine production or other pandemic relief efforts, it could delay manufacturing services by our suppliers and delay manufacture of our products and product candidates, negatively impact our ability to conduct clinical trials and maintain inventories of our products, any of which could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022The potential economic and financial impacts of the pandemic, including a deterioration in economic conditions that may negatively impact revenue and our liquidity, increase expenses and result in market capitalization declines, and disruption to our business, may result in the impairment of our long-lived and other assets, including goodwill, intangible assets and equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair values. The impairment of significant assets could have a material impact on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, any impairment charge would have a negative impact on our financial results in the quarter that the charge is taken, and such charge may be material in amount.\n\u2022In accordance with business continuity plans and for the safety of our employees, we have directed most of our personnel to work remotely and we have generally restricted on-site staff to only those personnel and contractors who perform essential activities that must be completed on-site. Our increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay, or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, this could increase our cyber-security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations.\n\u2022While our essential R&D employees have been able to access our laboratory space, if employees and contractors conducting such activities were exposed to or contracted COVID-19, we may be required to restrict access to our laboratory space for an extended period of time as a result. Governmental authorities may also impose restrictions limiting access to our lab space. As a result, this could delay timely completion of preclinical and other R&D activities.\n\u2022Health regulatory agencies globally may experience disruptions in their operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies may have slower response times or be under-resourced to continue to authorize and monitor our clinical trials or review regulatory submissions (or authorize the use of facilities for manufacturing and related services) and, as a result, review, inspection, and other timelines may be materially delayed.\n\u2022In addition, a recession or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business, the value of our common shares and the availability of credit to operate our business and execute business development transactions. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital (if needed) through sales of our common shares, accessing credit to support our business development activities or other capital initiatives or such sales of common\nstock or credit may only be available on unfavorable terms.\n\u2022The trading prices for our common shares and other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect this volatility may continue.\nCOVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and stock price.\nRisks Related to Pricing and Reimbursement\nSales of our products depend on reimbursement by payers and these payers are subject to pressures to contain costs.\nOur commercial success depends on setting a price for our products that will enable us to obtain reimbursement at anticipated levels. Our products are significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments and almost all patients require governmental payers and/or private third-party payers to pay all or a portion of the cost of our products. There is a significant trend in the health care industry by public and private payers to contain or reduce their costs, including by taking the following steps, among others: decreasing the portion of costs payers will cover, ceasing to provide adequate payment for certain products or not covering certain products at all. If payers implement any of the foregoing with respect to our products, it would have an adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations. We have, for example, recently experienced non-governmental payers removing our products from their formulary and, therefore, it was not available to certain beneficiaries.\nOur ability to set the price for our products varies significantly from country to country, including in those countries where pricing, coverage, reimbursement or funding of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control. We may be unable to timely or successfully negotiate coverage, pricing and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us (or at all), or such coverage, pricing and reimbursement may differ in separate regions in the same country. In some countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed, which could delay market entry (or, if pricing is not approved, we may be unable to sell at all in a country where we have received regulatory approval for a product). In addition, authorities in some countries impose additional obligations, such as health technology assessments (HTAs), which assess, among other things, how well a prescription drug works in relation\nto its cost. Additionally, U.S. payers are increasingly considering new metrics, including HTAs, as the basis for reimbursement rates. If our products do not meet or surpass these metrics, these payers may not reimburse the use of our products or may reduce the rate of reimbursement for our products and as a result, revenue from such products may decrease. We have voluntarily elected to reduce prices or establish price caps with payers for certain products, which we believe provides value in the long term (but decreases revenue per patient).\nIn the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental controls on pharmaceutical pricing. Both the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government have recently unveiled proposals to implement such controls. In late-2020, CMS issued an interim final rule to implement a Most Favored Nation (MFN) Model for certain included drugs and biological products payable under Medicare Part B. The MFN Model would gradually reduce Medicare Part B reimbursement for included products to their respective MFN price, which generally reflects the lowest price for a pharmaceutical product sold in certain economically-comparable member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. SOLIRIS is one of 50 drugs and biological products included in the first performance year of the MFN Model. The MFN Model implementation was delayed as a result of certain litigation, but could have an impact on SOLIRIS revenue if implemented (for additional information on the MFN Model, see \u201cGovernment Regulation - Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Among some of the additional proposals from the executive and legislative branches are: to allow Medicare to negotiate certain drug prices (and such prices would apply to the private market as well) (this measure was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in late-2019), to move to a reimbursement regime that would establish pharmaceutical pricing by reference to a target price derived from the international price index, and to permit importation of medicines from other countries that have lower prices. Certain states have also proposed measures that are designed to control the costs of pharmaceuticals that they reimburse. If the U.S. (through the federal or state governments) were to move to a pricing system based on negotiated prices or to an international price index, such as the MFN Model (or similar model) that were to apply to our products, we expect that our revenues for sales in the U.S. would be lower, and potentially materially lower than if the current pricing program remained in place.\nOther countries, including many European countries and Canada, have established pricing and reimbursement policies that contain costs by referencing the price of the same or similar products in other countries. In these instances, if coverage or the level of reimbursement is reduced, limited or eliminated in one or more countries, we may be unable to obtain or maintain anticipated pricing or reimbursement in other countries or in new markets. This may create the opportunity for third-party cross-border trade or influence our decision whether to sell a product, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenues. See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for information about our lawsuit against the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) to establish that Alexion did not excessively price SOLIRIS in Canada, which uses reference pricing.\nDue to the cost of our therapies, any potential increase in the number of patients receiving our products may cause third-party payers to modify, limit or eliminate coverage or reimbursement for our products because they may require an allocation of a greater percentage of the potential financial resources of any public or private payer for our products.\nFurther, health insurance programs may utilize coverage incentives and obstacles to discourage beneficiaries from using higher priced products such as ours, including:\n\u2022establishing formularies under which only selected drugs are covered (which may exclude one or more of our products);\n\u2022utilizing variable co-payments that make drugs that are not preferred by the payer more expensive for patients; and\n\u2022utilizing management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization or failure first on another treatment.\nIn countries where patients have access to insurance, their insurance co-payment amounts or other benefit limits may represent a barrier to obtaining or continuing use of our products or adoption of new treatment options, such as ULTOMIRIS. The imposition or continuation of the use of these types of limits or barriers by insurers or the imposition of similar limitations or barriers in the future may have an adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations. In some cases, we have financially supported non-profit organizations that assist patients in accessing treatments, consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and government guidance. Such organizations assist patients whose insurance coverage imposes high co-payment amounts or other expensive financial obligations. Such organizations\u2019 ability to provide assistance to\npatients is dependent on funding from external sources, and we cannot guarantee that such funding will be provided at adequate levels, if at all. We have also provided our products without charge to patients who have no or limited insurance coverage for drugs through related charitable purposes, consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and government guidance. We are not able to predict the financial impact of the support we may provide for these and other charitable purposes; however, substantial support could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in the future.\nAs third-party payers attempt to contain health care costs, they are demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they may cover and the amounts that they will pay for drugs. As a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment to patients for our products or they may demand discounts or rebates from us, which may be material.\nIn 2020, three customers accounted for 47.4% of our total revenues. If any one or more of these customers were to require significant discounts or rebates, or were to discontinue purchasing our products (due to cost or otherwise), our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we cannot obtain new patents, maintain our existing patents and protect the confidentiality and proprietary nature of our trade secrets and other intellectual property, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and regulatory protections for our products and investigational compounds, to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and to prevent third parties from infringing on our rights.\nWe have procured patent rights, through both ownership and license, that cover our products and investigational compounds, and will likely apply for additional patent protections in the future. However, our patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the U.S. or other countries. In addition, a patent may be issued in one country, but a counterpart patent may not be issued in another country. For example, the European Patent Office in September 2019 rejected a patent application relating to the composition of matter for SOLIRIS; related patents were granted in the U.S. and Japan.\nEven if a patent is issued, that is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability and therefore that patent may not afford adequate (or any) protection for our products. On the basis of such inconclusiveness, third parties may challenge our patents, have done so in the past and, in some\ncases, have been successful in such challenges. For example, on January 21, 2019, the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office determined, following multi-party opposition proceedings, to revoke one of our European patents that relates to the formulation of SOLIRIS. Further, on August 30, 2019, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office instituted inter partes review (IPR) of three of our patents that relate to SOLIRIS. In May 2020, we entered into a Confidential Settlement and License Agreement with Amgen to settle the three IPRs (Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Alexion and Amgen have terminated each of the pending IPRs and, effective March 1, 2025 (or an earlier date in certain circumstances), Alexion grants to Amgen (and its affiliates and certain partners) a non-exclusive, royalty-free, license under U.S. patents and patent applications related to eculizumab and various aspects of the eculizumab product that Alexion currently markets and sells under the tradename SOLIRIS. We may enter into similar agreements in the future to grant or clarify certain rights of third-parties in connection with our intellectual property rights in SOLIRIS or other products or product candidates. In addition, under the settlement agreement with Amgen, if certain circumstances are satisfied, Amgen may have the right to market and sell an eculizumab product in the U.S. prior to March 2025.\nIf any of our patents are narrowed, invalidated, revoked or become unenforceable, competitors may develop and market products similar to ours that do not conflict with or infringe our patents rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Even if we obtain and maintain patents, our business may be significantly harmed if the patents are not broad enough to protect our products from copycat products. In addition, we may in the future enter into agreements similar to the agreement with Amgen that provides certain intellectual property rights to our marketed products or products in our pipeline.\nWe may finance or collaborate in research and development projects conducted by third parties, including government organizations, hospitals, universities or other educational or research institutions, or other for-profit companies. Such third parties may be unwilling to grant us certain rights to technology or products developed through such projects. Disputes may also arise as to the rights to technology or products developed in collaboration with such third parties.\nSignificant legal questions exist concerning the extent and scope of patent protection for biopharmaceutical products and processes in the U.S. and elsewhere. Accordingly, there is no certainty that patent applications owned or licensed by us will issue\nas patents, or that our issued patents will afford meaningful protection against competitors. Once issued, patents are subject to challenge through both administrative and judicial proceedings in the U.S. and other countries. Such proceedings include re-examinations, inter partes reviews, post-grant reviews and interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as opposition proceedings before the European Patent Office and other non-U.S. patent offices. Certain countries have laws that provide stronger bases for challenging third party patent rights than are available to challenge patents in other countries. Therefore, we may be able to defend our patents against a third-party claim in one country but counterpart patents may be invalidated in other countries and we may be able to invalidate a third-party patent in one country but not invalidate its counterpart patents in other countries. Litigation may be required to enforce, defend or obtain our patent and other intellectual property rights. Any administrative proceeding or litigation could require a significant commitment of our resources and, depending on outcome, could adversely affect the scope, validity or enforceability of certain of our patent or other proprietary rights.\nSome of the sensitive technology, techniques and proprietary compounds used in our business are protected as trade secrets. However, we may also rely on collaboration with, or discuss the potential for collaboration with, suppliers, outside scientists and other biopharmaceutical companies. Collaboration and discussion of potential collaboration or inadvertent disclosure of a trade secret present a strong risk of exposing our trade secrets. If our trade secrets were exposed, we may lose the protection and potential exclusive rights afforded by trade secret law, and such exposure may likely help our competitors and allow them to access technology without restriction and adversely affect our business prospects.\nIf we are found to be infringing third party patents, we may be forced to pay damages to the patent owner and/or obtain a license to continue the manufacture, sale or development of our products. If we cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from the manufacture, sale or development of our products or product candidates, which may adversely affect our business.\nParts of our technology, techniques, proprietary compounds and potential product candidates, including those which are or may be in-licensed or developed in collaboration with third parties, may be found to infringe patents owned by or granted to others. We have, and may in the future, receive notices claiming our products infringe third party patents and third parties have and may in the future file civil lawsuits against us claiming infringement of their intellectual property rights. Chugai\nPharmaceutical Co., Ltd. filed suits in the U.S. and Japan alleging that ULTOMIRIS infringes patents held by Chugai. See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies to the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Additional third parties may claim that the manufacture, use or sale of our products or product candidates infringes patents owned or granted to such third parties. We are aware of patents owned by third parties that might be claimed by such third parties to be infringed by the development and commercialization of our products or investigational compounds. In respect to some of these we have invalidated the patents, obtained licenses, or expect to obtain licenses. However, with regard to others we have determined in our judgment that:\n\u2022our products and investigational compounds do not infringe the patents;\n\u2022the patents are not valid or enforceable; and/or\n\u2022we have identified and are testing various alternatives that should not infringe the patents and which should permit continued development and commercialization of our products and investigational compounds.\nAny holder of these patents or other patents covering similar technology could sue us for damages, which may be material in amount, and seek to prevent us from manufacturing, selling or developing our products (and we may be, in certain cases, prevented from initiating product launches in certain jurisdictions or required to withdraw the product from the market after it has been launched). Intellectual property disputes, such as those initiated by Chugai, can be costly and time consuming to defend and there is no guarantee that we would prevail in such lawsuit. If we cannot successfully defend against any infringement claims, we may seek to invalidate the patent or seek a license to the technology prior to or during legal actions in order to reduce the risks in connection with the product launches (or at a later time after product introduction) and to reduce further costs and the risk of a court determination that our technology, techniques, proprietary compounds or potential product candidates infringe the third party\u2019s patents. A required license may be costly or may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A costly license, or inability to obtain a necessary license, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn some instances, we believe we may prevail in a patent infringement action. There can, however, be no assurance that the court will agree with our position or that it will decide any infringement case in our favor. Nor can we be certain that, if we do not prevail in litigation, that we may be able to obtain a license to any third-party patent on commercially\nreasonable terms (or at all); successfully develop non-infringing alternatives on a timely basis (or at all); or license alternative non-infringing technology, if any exists, on commercially reasonable terms (or at all). Any impediment to our ability to manufacture, use or sell approved forms of our products or our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nIt is possible that we could lose market exclusivity for a product earlier than expected, which may harm our competitive position.\nIn our industry, much of an innovative product\u2019s commercial value is realized while it has market exclusivity.\nMarket exclusivity for our products depends in large part on patent rights and certain regulatory forms of protection. As noted above, patent protection can be uncertain as to the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents. Absent relevant patent protection for a product, once regulatory exclusivity periods expire, biosimilar or generic versions of the product can be approved and marketed. For example, in 2019, a SOLIRIS biosimilar was approved in Russia for the treatment of patients with PNH and aHUS. We also believe that the manufacturer of a SOLIRIS biosimilar has commenced the process to obtain regulatory approval to market and sell a SOLIRIS biosimilar in Brazil and Turkey and, if approved, this biosimilar may compete with SOLIRIS in Brazil and Turkey.\nThe market exclusivity of our products may be impacted by competitive products that are either innovative, biosimilar or generic copies. In our industry, the risk of biosimilar or generic challenges has been increasing. U.S. law includes an approval pathway for biosimilar versions of innovative biological products. Under the pathway, the FDA may approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics (SOLIRIS, ULTOMIRIS and ANDEXXA are each innovative biologics) on the basis of less extensive data than is required for a full biologic license application (and there are similar pathways for generic copies of small molecule therapies (the Factor D therapies (ALXN2040 and ALXN2050) acquired in connection with the Achillion transaction are, for example, small molecules)). The law provides a mechanism to challenge the patents that protect an innovator\u2019s products. Such litigation may begin as early as four years after the innovative biological product is first approved by the FDA. Pathways for biosimilar products also exist in many other markets, including Europe, Japan and Russia. Other companies are developing and advancing SOLIRIS biosimilar programs, including conducting clinical trials. Competition, including from biosimilars approved for marketing, would likely result in a decrease in volume of sales of our products, as well\nas a decrease in prices and lower margins for our products. In addition, approval of a biosimilar that is a substitute for one of our products may increase the risk of accelerated market penetration by that biosimilar. Further, if patients or healthcare providers do not believe that ULTOMIRIS provides a compelling profile for patient conversion from SOLIRIS, a SOLIRIS biosimilar may not only be expected to have a material and negative impact on our SOLIRIS revenues and margins (which accounted for a significant percentage of our revenue in 2020), it may also have a material impact on ULTOMIRIS revenue and margins and the ability of ULTOMIRIS to gain market acceptance.\nOur other products and product candidates in development and trials are also at risk from biosimilars and generic drugs. Other than SOLIRIS for the treatment of gMG and NMOSD and SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS as a treatment for PNH and aHUS, each of our products is currently the only approved drug for the disease(s) the product treats. If a competitive product is approved for sale, including a biosimilar or generic product or other therapy (such as the two non-C5 therapies approved by certain regulatory authorities, including the FDA, as a treatment for NMOSD), our market share and our revenues could decline, particularly if the competitive product is perceived to be more effective or is less expensive than our product.\nRisks Related to Our Products and Product Candidates\nOur future commercial success depends on gaining regulatory approval for new products and obtaining approvals for existing products for new indications.\nWe invest significant amounts in acquiring new products and technologies and advancing our existing product candidates and technologies. Our success and revenue growth and diversification will depend in part on our identification, acquisition (including licenses from or collaborations with third parties), development and commercialization of new products and technologies, and approval of additional indications for our existing products and products under development. Product development is very expensive, takes significant time and involves a high degree of risk. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. For example, we recently paused enrollment in our ULTOMIRIS trial for certain COVID-19 patients due to lack of efficacy and in 2020 we terminated our agreement to co-develop ABY-039 with Affibody and determined not to exercise the co-development option agreement with Stealth BioTherapeutics Corp., in each case due to results of clinical trials. In addition, our recent investment and acquisition activities focused on new technologies with which we have limited experience, including a Factor Xa reversal agent and antibody therapeutics\ntargeting the neonatal Fc receptor, which may make the development, approval and commercialization of such potential products challenging for us.\nOur ability to maintain or grow and diversify revenues may be adversely affected if we are delayed or unable to successfully develop the products in our pipeline, if we are unable to gain approval for SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS for additional indications, for new routes of administration (subcutaneous delivery) and in new jurisdictions, obtain marketing approval for STRENSIQ, KANUMA and ANDEXXA in additional territories, obtain approval for different dosing regimens (or expansion of indications included in the product label) or acquire or license products and technologies from third parties.\nEven if we are successful in developing new products or addressing new indications, we cannot market any of those products unless and until we obtain all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we plan to sell these therapies. We must also maintain all such regulatory approvals for the period of time that we sell the product in each such jurisdiction. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in obtaining, approval or if we fail to maintain approvals once obtained, will prevent us from selling products and generating revenues for those products in such jurisdiction where we do not hold such approvals.\nOur products and product candidates target diseases and conditions with small patient populations and we may not be effective at identifying patients.\nThe therapies that we have developed, acquired and that are in our product pipeline and in preclinical development target diseases and conditions that have small patient populations that have not been definitively determined. Further, in many cases there are either no or limited diagnostic tools for the indications we treat or may treat in the future. The lack of diagnostic tools, coupled with the fact that there is frequently limited awareness among certain health care providers concerning the rare diseases we treat, often means that a proper diagnosis can, and frequently does, take years to identify (or an appropriate diagnosis may never be made for certain patients). As a result, we may not be able to grow our revenues (even as we introduce new products or as existing products are approved for additional indications). There can be no guarantee that any of our programs will be effective at identifying patients that will benefit from our therapies, and even if we can identify patients that our therapies can help, the number of patients that our therapies treat may turn out to be lower than we expect, they may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products, or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify, all of which may adversely affect our ability to grow and diversify revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and our business. In addition,\neven in instances where we do add patients, the number may be less than the number of patients that discontinue use of the applicable product in a given period resulting in a net loss of patients and potentially decreased revenue.\nWe may not be able to gain or maintain market acceptance of our products among the medical community, patients or payers, which could prevent us from maintaining profitability or growth.\nOur products may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians, patients, payers and others. Although we have received regulatory approval for certain of our products in certain territories (and may receive approvals for additional products or in additional jurisdictions), such approvals do not guarantee future revenue. Physicians\u2019 willingness to prescribe, and patients\u2019 willingness to accept, our products, depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022prevalence and severity of adverse side effects in both clinical trials and commercial use;\n\u2022the timing of the market introduction of competitive drugs, biosimilars and generics;\n\u2022perceived safety of our products\n\u2022demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs;\n\u2022perceived benefits relative to cost and/ or evaluations in HTAs (or similar assessments);\n\u2022pricing and availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including governmental entities;\n\u2022convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022effectiveness of our marketing strategy;\n\u2022publicity concerning our products and our other product candidates (and those of competitive products); and\n\u2022availability of alternative treatments.\nThe likelihood of physicians to prescribe SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS for patients who present in acute treatment settings may depend on how quickly SOLIRIS or ULTOMIRIS can be delivered to the hospital or clinic, and our distribution methods may not be sufficient to satisfy this need. In addition, while SOLIRIS as a treatment for aHUS is recommended by some regulatory authorities to be used for the duration of a patient\u2019s lifetime, we are aware that some healthcare providers prescribe SOLIRIS for aHUS for a shorter time period and, in some cases, may prescribe SOLIRIS for aHUS in emergency or acute situations only (and the same may occur in connection with the use of ULTOMIRIS for aHUS). Decisions such as this by aHUS patients and healthcare providers to use our products for a period\nthat is less than the remaining lifetime of the patient or in only acute circumstances may cause our SOLIRIS or ULTOMIRIS revenues, and revenues for our other products, to fluctuate and past sales of our products may not be indicative of future sales for such products.\nIf our products fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance among the medical community or patients in a particular country, we may not be able to market and sell our products successfully in such country, which may limit our ability to generate revenue and could harm our overall business.\nIf our products harm patients, or are perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our products, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of biologics and small molecule therapies for use in humans may cause harm to patients, which exposes us to product liability risks and regulatory penalties.\nOur products and our product candidates generally treat patients with rare diseases and, as a result, we generally are able to test our products in only a small number of patients. As more patients use our products, including more children and adolescents, new risks and side effects may be discovered, the rate of known risks or side effects may increase, and risks previously viewed as less significant could be determined to be significant.\nUnder pharmacovigilance guidelines, we are required to timely report any adverse events that any patient using our products experiences, as well as any clinical evaluations of outcomes in the post-marketing setting. This information is required to be reported to appropriate regulatory agencies in accordance with relevant regulations and, as a result, any potential adverse events will be promptly brought to the attention of regulators that may likely require prompt remedial action (and any failure to report these adverse events or report such events in a timely manner may result in penalties being imposed on Alexion by regulators). In the event any new risks or adverse effects are discovered as patients are treated for approved indications, or as our products are studied in or used by patients for other indications, regulatory authorities may delay or revoke their approvals or require changes to labeling or reformulation of the products (or take other actions that may adversely impact sales of such products).\nIf previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of our products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product, harm our reputation, result in product withdrawals, recalls, delays or revocations of regulatory approvals\nor require us to take actions that could negatively affect sales and operating results, including conducting additional clinical trials and safety studies, making changes in labeling, reformulating our products or making changes and obtaining new approvals for our and our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities. Further, any investigation into the circumstances surrounding an adverse event may be costly and time consuming (even if it is ultimately determined that the adverse event is not the result of the use of our product).\nThere are also risks associated with our products; for example, use of C5 Inhibitors, such as SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS, is associated with an increased risk for certain types of infection, including meningococcal infection. In certain cases, a physician may not have the opportunity to timely vaccinate a patient, especially for those patients that present in acute treatment settings, which could result in the patient using SOLIRIS or ULTOMIRIS experiencing a life-threatening meningococcal infection (and even in certain cases in which a vaccination can be delivered to the patient, it may not eliminate all risk of meningococcal infection). In addition, ANDEXXA has been associated with thrombolic risks, ischemic risks, cardiac arrest and sudden death. Patients using our products and product candidates have died or suffered potentially life-threatening conditions either during or after ending their treatments, and these include patients who have died while participating in a clinical trial. In addition, many patients who use our products are already very ill and may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may or may not be related to our products. We may be sued by patients who are harmed during the course of using our products, whether as a prescribed therapy, during a clinical trial, during an investigator-initiated study, or otherwise. Any such product liability lawsuit or injury claim, which could include class actions, could harm our reputation among patients, physicians, payers and others and require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, and even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations due to the expense of defending any such claim. While we do have product liability insurance, it may not cover all potential types of liabilities or may not cover certain liabilities completely. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe anticipate that we will face increased competition from companies that will enter into the markets we currently serve and as our product pipeline expands into markets that are currently served by other companies.\nWe expect that the business environment in which we operate will become increasingly\ncompetitive. Currently, certain of our products are the only approved therapies for certain indications they treat. For example, SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS are the only approved treatments for PNH and aHUS in the U.S., Europe and Japan. We expect that SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS may compete with new drugs and biosimilars currently in development. Several companies are developing other therapies to treat PNH, aHUS, gMG and NMOSD, and other pharmaceutical companies have publicly stated that they are developing and intend to commercialize a SOLIRIS biosimilar.\nIn 2020, the FDA and certain other foreign regulatory authorities have approved therapies developed by third parties for the treatment of NMOSD in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 antibody positive. The introduction of these and other competitive products may negatively impact our business, including our revenue and profitability. In addition, following the introduction of a SOLIRIS biosimilar in 2019 in Russia for the treatment of PNH and aHUS, we experienced a decrease in revenue from sales of SOLIRIS and expect that Russia will account for a minor portion, if any, of future SOLIRIS revenue as a result of this competitive product. We also believe that the manufacturer of a SOLIRIS biosimilar has commenced the process to obtain regulatory approval to market and sell a SOLIRIS biosimilar in Brazil and Turkey and, if approved, this biosimilar may compete with SOLIRIS in Brazil and Turkey and, like Russia, have an adverse impact on SOLIRIS revenues in Brazil and Turkey. STRENSIQ, KANUMA and ANDEXXA may also experience competition in the future. We are also aware of companies that have initiated or are planning to initiate studies for diseases and conditions that we are also targeting with our product pipeline. Our revenues could be negatively affected if patients or potential patients enroll in our clinical trials or clinical trials of other companies with respect to diseases and conditions that we also target with approved therapies.\nSome of our competitors and future competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us and may commercialize competitive products that are cheaper, more effective, safer, have less frequent dosing schedules, or are easier and quicker to administer than our products. Our current and future competitors may develop products that are more broadly accepted or may receive patent protection that dominates, blocks or adversely affects our product development or business. These competitive products, including any biosimilars approved under alternative regulatory pathways (or generics that may be approved that compete with our small molecule therapies), may significantly reduce both the price that we receive for our marketed products and the volume of products\nthat we sell, which may negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Given that a significant portion of our 2020 revenue was attributable to SOLIRIS, one or more competitive novel products or biosimilars could have a significant impact on our entire business.\nIn addition, we experience competition in drug development from universities and other research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies compete with us to attract universities and academic research institutions as drug development partners, including for licensing their proprietary technology. If our competitors successfully enter into such arrangements with academic institutions, we may be precluded from pursuing those unique opportunities and may not be able to find equivalent opportunities elsewhere.\nIf a company announces successful clinical trial results for a product that may be competitive with one of our products or product candidates, receives marketing approval of a competitive product, or gets to the market before we do with a competitive product, our business may be harmed or our stock price may decline.\nRisks Related to Business Operations\nWe rely on a limited number of facilities to produce our products and manufacturing issues at our facilities or the facilities of our third party service providers could cause product shortages, stop or delay commercialization of our products, disrupt or delay our clinical trials or regulatory approvals, and adversely affect our business.\nThe majority of our products and product candidates are biologics and the production of such biologic therapeutics that meet all product specification and regulatory requirements is particularly complex. Even slight deviations at any point in the production process may lead to production failures, product recalls and regulatory actions. In addition, because the production process involves the use of materials that are derived from biological sources, the process can be affected by contaminants that could impact those biological micro-organisms. These manufacturing challenges are coupled with the fact that we have limited experience manufacturing commercial quantities of certain of our products (so we or our third party manufacturers may have limited previous experience resolving any issues in connection with the manufacture of certain of our products and any issues may take significant time to remediate or we may be unable to solve any manufacturing problems). In addition, with our acquisition of Achillion, we also have small molecules in clinical trials and we are planning future clinical trials in new indications and we expect that manufacture of these therapies and compliance with cGMP will pose similar challenges and we have limited\nexperience manufacturing small molecules for clinical trials and for commercial sales.\nIf we and/or our third party manufacturers (including those involved in drug substance, drug product, and finished product) and other suppliers fail to meet the highly technical requirements/specifications of manufacturing our biologic and small molecule products and our strict quality and control specifications, we (or they) may be unable to manufacture or supply our products. We depend on our third party manufacturers to perform effectively on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory requirements and meet our product specifications. For example, we rely on Lonza owned and operated facilities for the production of a significant portion of our products, including ANDEXXA which we recently acquired, and Lonza has undertaken the construction and operation of new facilities to meet demand for certain of our products (including a new facility in New Hampshire that was qualified for manufacturing in 2020) and these facilities must meet our production requirements and new facilities must be qualified by regulatory authorities before product can be sold. Our failure or the failure of our third-party manufacturers (including the Lonza facilities that manufacture certain of our products) to produce sufficient quantities of our products and product candidates or to meet our specifications and quality standards or those standards imposed by regulatory authorities could result in lost revenue, diminish our profitability, delay the development of our product candidates, delay regulatory approval, result in the rejection of our product candidates or result in supply shortages for our patients, which may lead to lawsuits, harm to our reputation or could accelerate introduction of competing products to the market. For example, we experienced unexpected chemistry, manufacturing and control (or CMC) issues with our ALXN 1830 program that resulted in a delay in the clinical trial timeline for that program. We may experience similar CMC issues in the future that may impact marketed products or other clinical trials.\nIf we underestimate demand for ULTOMIRIS, SOLIRIS, ANDEXXA or any of our products, or experience product interruptions at Alexion\u2019s internal manufacturing facilities or a facility of a third party provider, including as a result of risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may not be able to increase our revenues and alternative therapies may gain greater market acceptance.\nWe also face external factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause production interruptions at our facilities or at the facilities of our third party providers, including natural disasters, public health crises (such as COVID-19), labor disputes, acts of terrorism or war.\nThe risks to our business of any manufacturing stops or interruptions (whether the result of internal or external factors of the nature identified above) are amplified because we rely on a limited number of facilities to produce our products and product candidates. Further, we expect that we will continue to rely on a very limited number of manufacturing facilities in the future for all of our products, including our complement inhibitors. Although we have business continuity plans, including with respect to inventory, to reduce the potential for manufacturing disruptions or delays and reduce the severity of a disruptive event, there is no guarantee that these plans will be adequate, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe and our third party suppliers and providers are required to maintain compliance with cGMP and other stringent operation and manufacturing requirements and are subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. Governmental authorities will generally not permit products manufactured at a facility that is not registered by the applicable government agency to enter into that country and such products may be returned for failure to comply with such regulation, which may decrease or delay sales and result in the loss of inventory. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, in connection with drug substance, drug product, finished product, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection or comply with ongoing operating regulations could significantly impair our ability to supply our products and product candidates. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions and damage our reputation.\nOur efforts to bring more of our manufacturing operations under our control present additional risks. We have made significant investments in biologics manufacturing facilities, warehousing, fill-finish and other facilities at our sites in Athlone and Dublin, Ireland and at dedicated sites owned by third parties, including a Lonza facility in New Hampshire. We commenced manufacturing operations at certain of these sites prior to receiving regulatory approval and we have $39.8 of product produced at such sites in inventory as of December 31, 2020. Despite the significant investment we have made in these facilities and operations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely complete the appropriate validation processes or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for these and other facilities, that we will be able to perform the intended manufacturing and supply chain services at these facilities for commercial or clinical use or that we will be able to use the product manufactured at these\nsites. Prior to such time, we may continue to rely on third parties for these services.\nIf our products are subject to any manufacturing issues or we lose manufacturing slots due to Operation Warp Speed, we may be unable to timely identify alternative manufacturers, and if we are able to timely identify alternative manufacturers, such alternative manufactures may not be able to satisfy our requirements. No guarantee can be made that regulators will approve additional third party providers in a timely manner or at all, or that any third party providers will be able to perform manufacturing or related services for sufficient product volumes for any country or territory. Further, due to the nature of the current market for third-party commercial manufacturing, many arrangements require substantial penalty payments by the customer for failure to use the manufacturing capacity for which it contracted. The payment of a substantial penalty could harm our financial condition and may restrict our ability to transition to internal manufacturing or manufacturing by other third parties. In addition, the terms and conditions to engage an additional third-party manufacturer may not be as favorable to us as our current arrangements and may likely reduce the profit on the sales of any products to which they relate. Further, transfer of production operations to a new supplier is time-consuming and new manufacturing will take significant time before the product can be sold commercially.\nAny adverse developments affecting our manufacturing operations or the operations of our third-party providers could result in a product shortage of clinical or commercial requirements, withdrawal of our product candidates or any approved products, shipment delays, lot failures or recalls. We may also have to write-off inventory and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Each of these could have an adverse material impact on our business individually or in the aggregate.\nWe rely on a limited number of providers for our raw materials and supply chain services, which could result in our being unable to continue to successfully commercialize our products and our product candidates (if approved) and to advance our clinical pipeline.\nCertain of the raw materials required in the manufacture and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may be subject to contamination or recall. Access to and supply of sufficient quantities of raw materials which meet the technical specifications for the production process is challenging, and often limited to single-source suppliers. If a raw material manufacturer were unable\nto supply such materials, our business may be impacted because we rely on one or a limited number of such manufacturers for certain materials for our products, including the limited third-parties we rely on to operate our master cell banks. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. The failure of these single-source suppliers to supply adequate quantities of raw materials for the production process in a timely manner, or at all, may impact our ability to produce sufficient quantities of our products for clinical or commercial requirements. A material shortage, delay, contamination, recall, or restriction on the use of certain biologically derived substances or any raw material used in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt manufacturing and materially limit our ability to generate revenues.\nIn addition, KANUMA is a transgenic product and the facilities on which we rely to produce raw material for KANUMA are the only animal facilities in the world that produce the necessary egg whites from transgenic chickens. Natural disasters, disease, such as exotic Newcastle disease or avian influenza, or other catastrophic events could have a significant impact on the supply of unpurified KANUMA, or destroy our animal operations altogether. If our animal operations are disrupted, it may be extremely difficult to set up another animal facility to supply the unpurified KANUMA.\nWe also depend on a very limited number of third party providers for supply chain services with respect to our clinical and commercial product requirements, including product filling, finishing, packaging and labeling.\nOur third-party raw material providers and supply chain service providers operate as independent entities and we do not exercise control over any such third-party provider\u2019s operations or their compliance with our internal or external specifications or the rules and regulations of regulatory agencies. Any contractual remedies we may have under agreements with these parties may not protect us from the harm suffered by our business or our patients if they fail to provide material or perform services that meet our specifications. Due to the highly specialized nature of the services performed by these third parties, particularly the supply of raw materials and other drug supply and drug product, as well as the delivery and supply chain operations regarding our products, we do not believe that we could quickly find replacement suppliers or service providers and, even if we were able to identify additional third parties, the terms of any such arrangement may not be favorable to us. In either of these cases, our revenue, results of operations, business and reputation may be harmed\nand we may not be able to provide the therapies that our patients require.\nThe success of our business may also depend on the security of our products while in the supply chain for delivery to patients, which, as noted above, is dependent on third-party providers. For example, if our products are not fully and adequately secured from unauthorized access by third parties, any of our products may be tampered with or contaminated. If our products were exposed to any tampering or contamination, or if they are not transported in accordance with the required specifications, our patients may be harmed through use of our products, and such harm may be severe. In addition, if the supply chain is not secure (or our distributors do not exercise control over our products while in their possession), we are also at risk for our products being diverted to patients other than those who are the intended recipient or to patients who do not have a prescription to receive our therapies (or it may be used for treatment by physicians who have not completed the necessary REMs protocols in order to treat patients) or it may be sold by distributors, channels or other entities that are not authorized by Alexion to sell our products. In addition, an unauthorized distributor may not properly store or ship our products, thereby exposing patients to potential harm from use of the product that was not handled in accordance with our standards. If any of the foregoing were to happen, we could be subject to costly litigation, significant monetary penalties, harm to our reputation and investigation by regulatory authorities (and potentially subject to regulatory action, including recall, product withdrawals, suspensions and monetary penalties).\nThe sale and use of counterfeit versions of our products could result in significant harm to patients, reduced sales of our products and harm to our reputation.\nWe are aware that counterfeit versions of our products have been sold by entities that are not affiliated with Alexion using product packaging suggesting that the product was manufactured by Alexion. If unauthorized third parties illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, those products may not meet our very stringent product specifications (or the manufacturing, handling and distribution requirements for our products) and any patient that takes any counterfeit product may suffer serious adverse health consequences, including death. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name and could result in lost sales for us and decreased revenues.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we\nmay be unable to successfully commercialize our products.\nWe currently market and sell our products in the U.S., the EU, Japan and several other territories through a direct sales force. In addition, in order to gain greater efficiencies in our operations, certain portions of our international commercial operations, including sales, distribution, marketing and related efforts in designated countries are conducted by third-parties.\nDue to the fact that some of our products are new to the market, we do not have lengthy experience in marketing and selling these products to patients, healthcare providers and payers (for example, we are relatively new to certain therapeutic areas, such as neurology (gMG and NMOSD)). In addition, ANDEXXA is also new to the market, having been authorized by the FDA to be marketed in the US in mid-2018. This challenge is coupled with the fact that many members of our sales and marketing team are new to working with Alexion products (and ANDEXXA) and we rely on third parties to market, distribute and sell our product in certain countries. The success of our re-launch of ANDEXXA will depend on our success in marketing the product and being able to execute on the sales strategy which will focus on issues such as pricing, removing access barriers and dosing to ensure appropriate use (and this launch strategy is different than that adopted by Portola prior to the acquisition). If we and our third parties are unable to successfully market and sell our new products (and expand our sales and commercial operations) and to successfully sell our products in new therapeutic areas, our business and sales may be harmed. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish, maintain and expand our own capabilities or maintain any sales, marketing or distribution agreements with third-party providers on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to continue to manage the transition to third-party sales, marketing and distribution in the relevant jurisdictions that will not cause any interruption or disruption in our business and sales of our products. We will not exercise the same degree of control over such third parties that we do over our direct sales force and the ability to direct the third party and provide incentives for such third party to market and sell our products may not be as strong as in the case of a direct sales force. As we move to new third party sales force, marketers and distributors in certain countries it may also increase the risk of litigation with or liability to third parties that we had previously engaged to perform services for us in jurisdictions where we are implementing these operational changes (and we have been subject to certain such claims in the past).\nEven if we hire qualified sales and marketing personnel necessary to support our objectives and\nenter into distribution agreements with third parties on acceptable terms, we may not hire such employees or enter into such agreements in an efficient manner or on a timely basis. We may not be able to forecast accurately the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution capabilities necessary to successfully market and sell our products, which could result in decreased revenues or margins. In addition, as we launch new products, such as ULTOMIRIS (and re-launch ANDEXXA), and we move into other therapeutic areas (such as neurology and reversal of Factor Xa inhibitors), and, if and when, the products we acquire in connection with acquisitions and development agreements with third parties move closer to regulatory approval, we may have a larger product portfolio and address more therapeutic areas and the foregoing risks may continue to apply and may increase. Our expenses associated with building up and maintaining the sales force and distribution capabilities around the world, and relying on third party sales, marketing and distribution, may be disproportionate compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales or any savings or efficiencies we gain through use of such third-parties. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in commercializing any of our products for the above referenced or other reasons.\nOur efforts to expand our business and product offerings through acquisitions of businesses and technologies may not be successful.\nBuilding our product pipeline is a key strategic objective to address revenue concentration risk in C5 complement inhibitors and we may, from time to time, evaluate and, when appropriate and in accordance with our obligations under the Merger Agreement with AstraZeneca, purchase businesses and acquire, co-develop or license technologies and products from third parties in an effort to expand and diversify our pipeline, product offerings, and our technologies. For example, in 2020 we acquired Portola and Achillion. Acquisitions of new businesses or products and in-licensing of new technologies and products may involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022substantial cash expenditures;\n\u2022potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities and incurrence of debt;\n\u2022assumption of material liabilities in connection with the target or purchased technology, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the operations of the acquired companies;\n\u2022failure of any acquired businesses or products or in-licensed products or\ntechnologies to achieve the scientific, medical, commercial or other results we anticipate;\n\u2022diverting our management's attention away from other business opportunities and on-going operations;\n\u2022the potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies;\n\u2022risks of entering disease areas and indications or modalities in which we have limited or no direct experience; and\n\u2022significant investments in resources and personnel to evaluate, integrate and develop acquisition and in-license programs.\nA substantial portion of our strategic efforts are focused on opportunities for rare disorders, but the availability of such opportunities may be limited. We may not be able to identify opportunities that satisfy our strategic criteria or are acceptable to us or our stockholders. Several companies have publicly announced intentions to establish or develop rare disease programs and we may compete with these companies (some of which may be larger and may be able to provide more consideration than we can) for the same opportunities. For these and other reasons, we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates or approved products on acceptable terms, or at all. In such event, we may not be able to further rebuild our pipeline and any future revenue may remain largely dependent on our existing products, which are subject to the risks noted above.\nIn addition, through our business development initiatives we have acquired or obtained rights to new technologies, including a therapy to reverse Factor Xa inhibitors, Factor D small molecules and two FcRN platforms (in February 2020, based on data from our Phase I study, we terminated the agreement to co-develop ABY-039 with Affibody, which was the developer of one such FcRN platform), among others. These technologies are intended to diversify our pipeline and revenue base (if products based on these technologies are, where applicable, approved by regulatory authorities), but we have limited experience with these technologies, including developing these therapies, operating clinical trials with these therapies, obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing these assets. If we are unable to successfully bring these products to market and to increase sales of approved medicines in the case of ANDEXXA, we may not be able to diversify our revenue or generate a return on our investments.\nEven if we are able to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and other strategic transactions, we may not be able to integrate or take full advantage of them. An acquisition or other strategic transaction may or may not result in short-\nterm or long-term benefits to us (such as our transactions with Affibody and Stealth). A commercial stage product or near-commercial stage product acquired may not result in the revenues that we anticipate or we may be unable to realize expected profits on sales due to expenses related to the manufacturing and/or sales of the commercial product. We may also incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business or an acquired or in-licensed product, particularly if the acquired technology is in preclinical trials or early-stage clinical trials. Any therapies we acquire that are pre-clinical or in clinical trials may not result in a commercialized product and any revenues, if the product is commercialized, may not meet our projections or result in generating an adequate return on our investment.\nThe acquired business of Portola may underperform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve anticipated synergies.\nWe completed the acquisition of Portola on July 2, 2020. Through the acquisition, we acquired ANDEXXA, a commercial-stage product that is intended, in part, to diversify our revenue from reliance on C5 inhibitors. The acquired business of Portola may underperform relative to our expectations, which may cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community\u2019s expectations, and it may not result in the revenue or generate the operating income in the future that we anticipate. The ultimate success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on Alexion\u2019s ability to successfully integrate the Portola business and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, innovation opportunities and operational manufacturing and sales efficiencies, from the acquisition and successful execution of our relaunch strategy for ANDEXXA, including expansion into new geographies and label expansion to include new indications. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of Alexion\u2019s common stock may decline. In addition, if the results of the Phase IV post-marketing trial required by the FDA does not meet the safety and efficacy requirements of the FDA, ANDEXXA (the product that generated almost all of Portola\u2019s revenues) may be withdrawn from the market or otherwise subject to regulatory restrictions which may limit the ability to realize expected value from the transaction. Andexanet alfa also received conditional approval in the EU.\nThe integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation:\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022managing a larger combined business that includes a new therapeutic area for Alexion;\n\u2022retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and employees and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; and\n\u2022coordinating geographically separate organizations.\nThe financial results of ANDEXXA, and our ability to generate returns on our investment in Portola, will require that we successfully commercialize this product (which received conditional approval from the FDA in 2018). ANDEXXA utilization will depend, in large part, on access for the therapy at both the institutional level (where adoption will be driven by hospitals and emergency care facilities including ANDEXXA in the approved protocols for care and by ANDEXXA being qualified for adequate reimbursement by payers for use) and at the individual prescriber level (where adoption will be driven by immediate physical access to the product as it will be used in the acute care setting and by acceptance and endorsement of use by individual physicians who will need to be satisfied with, among other things, ANDEXXA's safety and efficacy). In addition, ANDEXXA may not gain expected market acceptance due to, among other reasons: pricing and reimbursement decisions and lower than anticipated usage at facilities and dosing. While we do have experience with obtaining institutional approval for our therapies and promoting acute care products (SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS for aHUS) we will need to effectively address the needs of institutions and prescribers, as noted above, in order to increase sales of ANDEXXA.\nIn order to support potential growth of the business, we will be required to make significant investments in our business operations.\nTo effectively manage our current and future potential growth, we must continue to effectively enhance and develop our global employee base and our operational and financial processes. Supporting our growth strategy may require significant capital expenditures and management resources, including investments in research, development, sales and marketing, clinical trial capabilities, manufacturing and other areas of our operations. Efforts to advance our product pipeline, including the increased number of clinical trials that are under way or will commence in the future, will require significant expense in 2021. The development or expansion of our business, any acquired business or any acquired or in-licensed products may require a substantial capital investment by us and we may likely incur substantial expenses in advancing acquired products through development, trials, regulatory approval and to commercialization. We may not have\nthe necessary funds for these capital expenditures and expenses or these funds might not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We may also seek to raise funds by incurring additional indebtedness and selling shares of our capital stock (where permitted under our existing contractual obligations), which could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in our company, or securities convertible into our capital stock (where permitted under our existing contractual obligations), which could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in us upon conversion.\nCompletion of proof of concept trials, biomarker studies, preclinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee advancement to the next phase of development or regulatory approval or successful commercialization.\nConducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process and there are no guarantees that any trial will meet its endpoints or objectives. Completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee that we will initiate additional studies or trials for our product candidates, if further studies or trials are initiated, what the scope and phase of the trial will be or that they will be completed, or if these further studies or trials are completed, that the design or results may provide a sufficient basis to apply for or receive regulatory approvals or to commercialize products. Results of clinical trials could be inconclusive, requiring additional or repeat trials. Data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Many companies have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials but nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their drug candidate. If the design or results achieved in our clinical trials are insufficient to proceed to further trials or to sustain regulatory approval of our product candidates, our business could be materially adversely affected. Failure of a clinical trial to achieve its pre-specified primary endpoint or objective generally increases the possibility that additional studies or trials may be required if we even determine to continue development of the product candidate, reduces the likelihood of timely development of and regulatory approval to market the product candidate, and may decrease the chances for successfully achieving the primary endpoint(s) or objective(s) in scientifically similar indications.\nWe are currently planning and conducting several clinical trials of products and product candidates that we anticipate may be important to our goal of expanding our business and diversifying our product portfolio. These trials may not yield the anticipated\nresults for a number of reasons and may not result in a product that obtains regulatory approval.\nULTOMIRIS may not be approved as a treatment for additional indications or in other jurisdictions and any clinical trials may not achieve the designated endpoints and prove to be effective for use in patients with these additional indications. For example, we have initiated Phase III clinical trials for ULTOMIRIS as a treatment for: (i) Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), (ii) patients with COVID-19, who are hospitalized with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation and (iii) patients with HSCT TMA, (and we plan to initiate studies of ULTOMIRIS in other indications). There is no guarantee that the Phase III clinical trial for ALS, and HSCT TMA (or the additional studies that we are planning for ULTOMIRIS) will provide sufficient evidence to advance our research beyond these stages. Drug development is very uncertain. We had, for example, conducted an exploratory clinical study in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) that we have decided to no longer pursue based on biomarker analysis. Further, in January 2021, based on the recommendation of the IDMC, we recently paused enrollment in our ULTOMIRIS trial for certain COVID-19 patients due to lack of efficacy.\nIn addition, we are also conducting clinical trials in therapeutic areas with which we have limited experience (for example, ALXN1840 (WTX101), a therapy for Wilson\u2019s disease), Factor D small molecules, and with technology platforms with which we also have limited experience (for example, humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the interaction of FcRn with Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG immune complexes). Further, we plan to initiate a Phase II clinical trial for ALXN2040 in Geographic Atrophy (GA), which is our first clinical trial in ophthalmology, an indication with which we have limited experience at Alexion. In addition, we intend to also initiate a proof of concept trial using a Factor D molecule, ALXN2050, in patients with various renal diseases. And we are pursuing trials to expand the label for ANDEXXA to treat additional acute care indications. Each of these clinical trials, and any other trial we commence, require significant financial expenses and operational resources, is subject to the risks highlighted above and the investments we have made in these technologies may not generate the expected returns.\nOur clinical studies may be costly and lengthy, and there are many reasons why drug testing could be delayed or terminated.\nFor human trials, patients must be recruited and each product candidate must generally be tested at various doses and formulations for each clinical indication. Many of our programs focus on diseases and conditions with small patient populations making\npatient enrollment difficult and requiring a relatively large number of trial sites to meet enrollment requirements to power our clinical trials to our desired levels for efficacy and, in certain cases, superiority. Additionally, we can have multiple clinical trials running for the same indication, further challenging clinical trial enrollment. Insufficient patient enrollment in our clinical trials could delay or cause us to abandon a product development program. We may decide to abandon development of a product candidate or a study at any time due to unfavorable results or other reasons, including if there are concerns about patient safety (as patients have, and may in the future, suffer injuries during clinical trials). If initial trials do not produce adequate results, we may have to spend considerable resources repeating clinical trials or conducting additional trials, either of which may increase costs and delay revenue from those product candidates, if any. We may open clinical sites and enroll patients in countries where or for indications in which we have little experience.\nEven if we were to complete clinical trials for one or more of our therapies, we or regulatory authorities may determine that the results are not be sufficient for filing a BLA or NDA or granting approval to market the therapy.\nWe rely on a small number of clinical research organizations to carry out our clinical trial related activities, and two contract research organizations (CROs) are responsible for many of our studies. We rely on such parties to enroll clinical sites and patients, operate trials and accurately report their results. Our reliance on CROs may impact our ability to control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials. In addition, we may be responsible for any errors in clinical trials by a CRO as a result of the performance of services in connection with a clinical trial on our behalf. And regulatory agencies, in connection with a potential product approval or as part of ongoing monitoring, will review a CRO's compliance with regulatory requirements relating to clinical trials and we may be subject to findings and regulatory action (including denial or delay of product approval) if a CRO fails to comply with regulations.\nAdditional factors that can cause delay, impairment or termination of our clinical trials or our product development efforts include:\n\u2022delay or failure in obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval or the approval of other reviewing entities to conduct a clinical trial at each site;\n\u2022delay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022clinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022delay or failure in having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate;\n\u2022disruption of operations at the clinical trial sites;\n\u2022adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients;\n\u2022failure of patients taking the placebo to continue to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022insufficient clinical trial data to support safety and effectiveness of the product candidates;\n\u2022lack of effectiveness or safety of the product candidate being tested;\n\u2022decisions by regulatory authorities, the IRB, ethics committee, or us, or recommendation by a data safety monitoring board, to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n\u2022failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the product candidate or the approvals for the facilities in which such product candidate is manufactured; and\n\u2022decisions by competent authorities, IRBs or ethics committees to demand variations in protocols or conduct of clinical trials\nWe expect our operating results to fluctuate.\nOur quarterly revenues, expenses and net income (loss) may fluctuate, even significantly, due to certain risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d as well as the timing of charges and expenses that we may take, acquisitions and business development transactions and the impact of converting patients from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS (as noted above). We may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Since we have a limited sales and operating history with certain of our products and for new indications of existing products (such as ANDEXXA and the 100mg/mL formulation of ULTOMIRIS), we may not be able to accurately forecast demand for our products or for new indications and formulations. Product demand and, in the case of conversion to ULTOMIRIS, product preference and conversion, is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. For\nthese reasons, we may not be able to accurately forecast demand for our products. You should not consider our financial performance, including our revenue growth, in recent periods as indicative of our future performance.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will achieve our financial goals, including our ability to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.\nIn the future, we may not generate sufficient revenues or control expenses to achieve our financial goals. Our investors and investment analysts may have widely varying expectations that may be materially higher or lower than actual revenues and profits and if our revenues and profits are different from these expectations, our stock price may experience significant volatility. Our revenues and profits are also subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations and our results of operations could be adversely affected due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Although we use derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful.\nIn addition, we have in the past provided financial guidance and anticipated customers for certain indications for future periods (including neurology patients in the U.S. using our products), and future product launches and if our actual operating results fail to meet or exceed the guidance or forecasts that we have previously provided to our investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly. Financial guidance, anticipated customer levels and product launches are based on certain assumptions about future performance and such guidance and forecasts are not a guarantee that the targets set forth will be achieved. In addition, due to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, operations and results of operations (including our revenues), the estimates, judgments and inputs required to generate guidance and customer levels are increasingly uncertain and therefore accurately forecasting performance is even more challenging in light of the current health crisis.\nAs we attempt to grow and expand our business, we may have substantial expenses as we continue our research and development efforts and our efforts to develop the assets we have acquired through acquisitions, collaborations and in-licenses, continue to undertake additional business development activities, continue to conduct clinical trials and continue to develop and expand manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities worldwide, some of which could be delayed, scaled-back or eliminated to control expenses and/or achieve our financial objectives. Additionally, business development activities may include milestone and royalty obligations and may require substantial\ninvestment in research and development to achieve product approval. These expenses may increase and such increases may exceed analyst and investor expectations.\nIf we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize our products or products candidates.\nThe success of our business is dependent in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain our senior management, and other highly qualified personnel in our scientific, clinical, manufacturing, governmental regulations and commercial organizations and across the many geographies in which we operate. There is intense competition in the biopharmaceutical industry for these types of personnel.\nOur business is specialized and global and we must attract and retain highly qualified individuals across many geographies and areas of expertise. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the highly qualified personnel necessary to develop, manufacture and commercialize our products and product candidates. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, or if our recruitment efforts take longer than anticipated, our business may be harmed.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our current and future restructuring plans and restructurings may adversely affect our business.\nWe initiated our most recent restructuring in the third quarter 2020, which is principally focused within our commercial organization as part of an initiative intended to redefine our operating model and reallocate resources necessary to align our organization with our diversifying portfolio of new products and strategic objectives. We may undertake additional restructurings in the future. Implementation of a restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business, and we may not be able to obtain the estimated cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with a restructuring in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, as a result of any restructuring, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees\u2019 time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to satisfy our debt service obligations or our contingent obligations, we may be unable to\ncommercialize our products or continue or complete our product development.\nWe have significant debt service obligations. In addition to the obligations to make interest and principal payments under our credit facility throughout the term of the loans, any changes in interest rates related to this debt could significantly increase our annual interest expense and any hedging of this interest may not be effective to control expenses.\nOur Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and negative covenants, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, and engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, subject to limited exceptions. If an event of default occurs (due to, for example, the failure to comply with certain covenants in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), the interest rate may increase and the administrative agent may be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. If the interest rate imposed under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were to increase as a result of a default, our expenses may increase and we may need to allocate additional funds to this interest expense (which may limit the use of these funds for other purposes, including growing our business or responding to changes in our business and industry). If some or all of the amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were to be accelerated by the lenders, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to pay the amounts due, we may not be able to refinance such debt on terms acceptable to us (or at all) and we may be required to sell certain assets on terms that are unfavorable to us.\nIn addition, we have substantial contingent liabilities, including milestone and royalty obligations associated with acquisitions and strategic transactions, and we have been, and in the future may again be, engaged in disputes with certain counterparties regarding potential milestone and royalty obligations (we are currently subject to a claim in litigation in connection with the Syntimmune acquisition that we failed to meet our obligations with respect to the contingent consideration and plaintiff has requested payment of the full earn-out amount) . Our increased indebtedness, including increased interest expense, together with our significant contingent liabilities, could, among other things:\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns and competitive pressures;\n\u2022make it difficult for us to make payments on our credit facilities and require us to use cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt\nobligations, which may reduce the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts and research and development;\n\u2022limit our ability to incur additional debt or access the capital markets; and\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business.\nOur ability to satisfy our obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and meet our debt service obligations and our royalty and milestone obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in accordance with our existing contractual commitments to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, and other business activities (including business and technology acquisitions). The amount of capital we may need depends on many factors, including, the cost of any acquisition or any new collaborative, licensing or other commercial relationships that we may establish, the time and cost necessary to build and complete new manufacturing facilities or enhance our manufacturing and related operations, amounts we may need to pay in connection with the resolution of any government investigation or litigation matter (including any securities class action matter or any product liability claim or any tax assessment or liability), the cost of obtaining and maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals for our manufacturing facilities, and the progress, timing and scope of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and product development and commercialization efforts. The capital and credit markets have experienced and may continue to experience extreme volatility and disruption. We may not receive additional funding when we need it or funding may only be available on unfavorable terms. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our working capital, capital requirements and debt repayment obligations (or royalty and milestone obligations) or business development activities, we may have to delay, scale-back or eliminate certain research, development, manufacturing, acquisition or commercial activities or sell certain assets and technologies.\nWe have incurred significant impairment charges, and may continue to incur such charges in the future for certain of our assets, including goodwill in connection with acquisitions, and such amounts may be material.\nIf the purchase price of a business acquisition exceeds the value of the assets (and liabilities) acquired, the acquirer must recognize goodwill in such amount. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets, and such charges may be material and have an adverse impact on our financial results in the period such charges are incurred and may also have an adverse impact on our reputation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, net totaled $8,102.5. As required by GAAP, we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or as facts and circumstances warrant. We have recorded charges that include inventory write-downs for failed quality specifications or recalls, impairments with respect to investments and acquisitions, fixed assets and long-lived assets, outcomes of litigation and other legal or administrative proceedings, regulatory matters and tax matters, and payments in connection with acquisitions and other business development activities, such as milestone payments. The impairment of tangible and intangible assets may be triggered by developments both within and outside our control. Deteriorating economic conditions, technological changes, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, adverse clinical results, intensified competition, divestitures, market capitalization declines and other factors may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs part of our standard quarterly procedures, we review facts and circumstances regarding our long-lived assets, including the KANUMA asset, to assess for potential indicators of impairment. During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, based on continued challenges expanding patient growth and new alternative commercial opportunities, we revised our strategic view of KANUMA and determined that we have exhausted commercially viable initiatives related to KANUMA and will have difficulty expanding patient growth over the long term as we focus on promoting other commercial programs and growing our pipeline. While management is committed to continued access to KANUMA for existing patients and providing access to future patients diagnosed with LAL-D, as we grow our business and product offerings, including through the recent acquisition of Portola Pharmaceuticals, we will prioritize programs where the opportunity to find patients who can benefit from Alexion therapies is the greatest. Therefore, we no longer expect to increase the number of KANUMA patients at the rate we previously assumed in our cash flow projections for KANUMA. As a result of these developments during the second quarter 2020, management adjusted assumptions in our long term cash flow forecast\nmodel for KANUMA and recognized an impairment charge of $2,042.3 related to the associated intangible asset.\nCash flow models used in our assessments of intangible assets are based on the projected commercial sales of the underlying products which considers, where applicable, our commercial experience with the product to date. Cash flow models for products currently in development also include the likelihood of approval. These cash flow models require the use of significant estimates and judgements, which include, but are not limited to, probability of regulatory approval, market access assumptions, long-range pricing expectations and patient-related assumptions, including patient identification, conversion and retention rates. As we continue to develop and sell products that have a related intangible asset associated with it, new data may cause us to adjust the assumptions in our cash flow models. Changes to assumptions used in our net cash flow projections may result in material impairment charges in subsequent periods, similar to the impairment charge recognized in the second quarter 2020 related to KANUMA.\nThe efficiency of our corporate structure depends on the application of the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities or our effective tax rate could increase, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nAs a company with international operations, we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable at the time made, the final taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements (and such differences may be material). If the IRS, or other taxing authority, disagrees with the positions we take (and such tax authorities have disagreed with certain positions we have taken in prior years, and may do so again the future), we could have additional tax liability, and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations, including potential changes following the U.S. presidential and congressional elections, changes in interpretations of tax laws, including pending tax law changes, changes in our manufacturing activities and changes in our future levels of research and development spending.\nWe have designed, and from time to time we modify, our corporate structure, the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property, and our intercompany transactions between our affiliates in a way that is intended to enhance our operational and financial efficiency and increase our overall profitability. The application of the tax laws and regulations of various countries in which we operate and to our global operations is subject to interpretation. We also must operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure to realize such efficiencies. The tax authorities of the countries in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or for transfer pricing or other operations. If tax authorities determine that the manner in which we operate results in our business not achieving the intended tax consequences, our effective tax rate could increase (and such increase may be material) and harm our financial position and results of operations. For example, in August 2020, we received a notice of examination from the Dutch Tax Authorities (\u201cDTA\u201d) regarding certain matters relating to our 2014 through 2017 tax years. We entered into an agreement with the DTA in December 2020 and have agreed to pay approximately $73.8 in connection with the settlement, inclusive of the 2018 and 2019 tax years. After taking into account the $56.1 U.S. foreign tax credit claimed on the settlement, the net cash outflow was $17.7, representing a 3.1% net increase to the effective tax rate. In addition, certain governments are considering and may adopt tax reform measures that significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and other government bodies have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations, including, in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d where payments are made from affiliates in jurisdictions with high tax rates to affiliates in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. It is possible that these reform measures could increase our effective tax rate (and such increase may be material) and harm our financial position and results of operations over the next several years.\nOur sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks relating to the conduct of our international business.\nWe have increased our international presence, including in emerging markets. Our operations in foreign countries subject us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022difficulties or the inability to obtain necessary foreign regulatory or reimbursement approvals of our products in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022political or economic determinations or decisions that adversely impact pricing or reimbursement policies in foreign countries;\n\u2022economic problems or political instability;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022difficulties or inability to obtain financing in markets;\n\u2022unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022customs and tax officials in foreign jurisdictions may disagree with the value we set when we or others import our products (including products that are donated for charitable purposes or used for clinical trials) and we may be required to pay additional duties or fines and such amounts may be substantial. For example, our offices in Brazil were visited by the Brazilian federal tax authorities and we received a written notice from such authorities requesting information with respect to the importation of SOLIRIS free of charge to patients in Brazil from 2014 to 2019. In connection with this matter, in August 2019, the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service provided a Notice of Tax and Description of the Facts to, among others, two Alexion subsidiaries. This notice focuses on: (i) the identity of the importer and (ii) the importation value of SOLIRIS vials in connection with Alexion\u2019s free drug program in Brazil. See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this matter);\n\u2022difficulties in establishing and enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022compliance with complex import and export control laws;\n\u2022trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities;\n\u2022compliance with local tax, employment and labor laws;\n\u2022costs and difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified managers and employees to manage and operate the business in local jurisdictions;\n\u2022costs and difficulties in managing and monitoring international operations; and\n\u2022longer payment cycles\nAdditionally, our business, operations and marketing methods are subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, which may differ significantly from country to country and may conflict with U.S. laws and regulations. The FCPA and anti-bribery laws and regulations in the locations in which we operate our business are extensive and far-reaching, and we must maintain\naccurate records and control over the activities of our employees, distributors and third party service providers in countries where we operate. We have policies and procedures, and we are committed to continually focusing on our compliance program and we continue to enhance our comprehensive company-wide program and efforts, and these are designed to enhance our business processes, structures, controls, training, talent, and systems across Alexion\u2019s global operations and to help us and our representatives, including our employees and our vendors and distributors, comply with such laws. We cannot, however, guarantee that these policies, programs and procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws for actions taken by us, our employees or our representatives. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations, including the FCPA and the UK Anti-Bribery Act, could result in the imposition of fines, civil and criminal penalties, equitable remedies, including disgorgement, injunctive relief, and/or other sanctions against us, and remediation of such findings could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. In addition, as our international operations expand, we are likely to become subject to new anti-corruption/anti-bribery laws or existing laws may govern our activities in new jurisdictions in which we commence operations. In addition, as we have moved from a direct sales force to third-party sales force, distributors and marketers in certain countries and regions, we may also have liability under the FCPA and anti-bribery laws and regulations for the actions of these third parties. Although we can impose contractual restrictions on what these third parties are authorized to do on our behalf, we will exercise only limited control over the actions of these third parties but may still face the same liabilities for their actions. Our failure, and the failure of others who we engage to act on our behalf, to comply, with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, or will operate in the future, could materially harm our business.\nOur business involves environmental risks and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\nAs a biopharmaceutical company, our business involves the use of certain hazardous materials in our research, development, manufacturing and other activities. We and our third party providers are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning the handling and disposal of regulated wastes, such as medical and biological wastes, chemical wastes and potential emissions and discharges into the environment (including air, soils and water sources). We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the\nenvironment and a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating such property or locations (should a release occur), without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination. Although our safety procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials are designed to comply with the laws and regulations established by state, federal, local and foreign regulators, the risk of loss of, or accidental contamination or injury from, these materials cannot be eliminated. If an incident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for remediation obligations, damages and fines that could exceed our insurance coverage and financial resources. Such obligations and liabilities, which to date have not been material, could have a material impact on our business and financial condition. Additionally, the cost of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in the future, and we may be required to dedicate more resources, including substantial financial resources, to comply with such laws and regulations or purchase supplemental insurance coverage, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nCurrency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could adversely affect our revenue, increase our costs and negatively affect our profitability.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and such fluctuations affect our operating results. The exposures result from portions of our revenues, as well as the related receivables and expenses, that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian dollar and Turkish Lira. We cannot predict fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such fluctuations in exchange rates (and inflation) could negatively affect our business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects. We manage a portion of our foreign currency transaction risk within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives. All of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. While our hedging agreements may limit some of the exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and not always successful and the results may have a material impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and if we or our third-party providers fail to comply with U.S. and\nforeign regulations, we or our third party providers could lose our approvals to market our products or our product candidates, and our business may be seriously harmed.\nWe and our current and future third-party vendors, including contract manufacturers, CROs, distributors and suppliers and logistic providers are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by governmental authorities around the world, including the FDA, EMA, the competent authorities of the EU Member States and the MHLW. These regulations, many of which are complex, relate to almost all aspects of our business, including GCP, GLP, cGMP and pharmacovigilance rules (for additional information on the regulations relating to our business, see \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation\u201d in Item 1 elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). If we or a regulatory agency discover new or previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where a product is manufactured (such as product contamination), or in the case of KANUMA, problems with animal operations, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that applicable product, the manufacturing facility or us. In 2013, we received a Warning Letter from the FDA relating to compliance with FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements at one of our facilities, which was remediated. If we had failed to address the FDA\u2019s concerns or if we (or one of our third-party contract manufacturers) were to receive another Warning Letter in the future relating to cGMP or other applicable regulations, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could take regulatory action, including fines, civil penalties, recalls, seizure of product, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of clinical trials, withdrawal of FDA (or other regulatory authority) approval and/or criminal prosecution.\nIf we or our third-party providers, including our product or raw material manufacturers, product fill-finish providers, packagers and labelers, fail to comply fully with applicable regulations, then we may be required to, among other things, initiate a recall or withdrawal of our products. In addition to our manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers\u2019 manufacturing operations being subject to inspection and potential regulatory action for failure to comply with (among other regulations) cGMP, our animal operations may also be subject to FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) inspection to evaluate whether our animal husbandry, containment, personnel, and record keeping practices are sufficient to ensure safety and security of our transgenic chickens and animal products (e.g., eggs, waste, etc.). Any failure to ensure safety and security of our transgenic chickens and/or animal products\ncould result in regulatory action by the FDA or another regulatory body, including USDA APHIS.\nFailure to comply with the laws and requirements that apply to our business, including statutes and regulations, administered by the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the MHLW or other comparable agencies, could result in:\n\u2022a product recall;\n\u2022a product withdrawal;\n\u2022modification or revision to a product label;\n\u2022significant administrative and judicial sanctions, including, warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022significant fines and other civil penalties;\n\u2022suspension, variation or withdrawal of a previously granted approval for our products;\n\u2022interruption, suspension or termination of production;\n\u2022operating restrictions, such as a shutdown of production facilities or production lines, or new manufacturing requirements;\n\u2022suspension or termination of ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022delays in approving or refusal to approve our products, including pending BLAs, NDAs or BLA or NDA supplements for our products, or a facility that manufactures our products;\n\u2022seizing or detaining product;\n\u2022requiring us or third-parties performing services for us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022injunctions; and/or\n\u2022criminal prosecution.\nIn addition, we are subject to antitrust regulations with respect to interactions with other participants in the markets we currently serve or may serve in the future. These antitrust laws are vigorously enforced in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur product candidates require extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval and failure to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to safety and efficacy thresholds may prevent us from being able to market our products and limit our ability to grow our business and diversify our revenue.\nWe believe our future success may depend on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and, to this end, we have acquired\ncompanies and technologies in an effort to expand our product pipeline. Our product candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy the rigid safety and efficacy requirements of the FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies before they can be approved for sale to patients. To satisfy these standards, we must ensure, among other things, that we have appropriately established our protocol designs, obtained the necessary IRB approval (or comparable approval), provided adequate patient enrollment rates, timely and appropriately reported any adverse events and serious adverse events to the appropriate authorities and ensured compliance with cGLP and cGCP. If we or our third-party clinical trial providers or third-party CROs do not successfully carry out these clinical activities, our clinical trials or the potential regulatory approval of a product candidate may be delayed or be unsuccessful.\nIf we discover safety or safety reporting issues with any of our approved products, or if we fail to comply with continuing U.S. and applicable foreign regulations as they relate to our products and operations, our revenue may decrease, an approved product could lose its marketing approval or sales could be suspended and our business could be materially harmed.\nFollowing marketing approval of a pharmaceutical product, the safety profile of such product continues to be closely monitored by the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities. Regulations continue to apply after product approval, and cover, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, finishing, filling, labeling, advertising, promotion, risk mitigation, adverse event reporting requirements and export of biologics and small molecule compounds. Included in the post-approval marketing requirements are, for example, the REMS program for both SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS in the U.S., and a REMS program can be updated from time to time by the FDA and such updates can be costly and burdensome to implement. In addition, continued approval for ANDEXXA for its currently approved indication in the US is contingent upon post-marketing study results that verify that clinical benefit is conferred to patients.\nWe are required to report any serious and unexpected adverse experiences and certain quality problems with our products to the FDA, the EMA, the MHLW and other health agencies. Adverse safety events involving our products may have a negative impact on our business. Discovery of safety issues with our products could result in product liability claims and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for revised labeling, additional safety monitoring, withdrawal of products from the market and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. In addition, governmental authorities are making greater amounts of safety information directly\navailable to the public through periodic safety update reports, patient registries and other reporting requirements. The reporting of adverse safety events may also damage physician, patient and/or investor confidence in our products and our reputation. Any adverse events in connection with the use of our products could result in liabilities, loss of revenues, material write-offs of inventory, material impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges, product liability claims and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nRegulatory agencies periodically inspect our pharmacovigilance processes. If these regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties whom we do not control that perform pharmacovigilance-related services on our behalf, including clinical trial investigators and distributors, have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, clinical holds, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including monetary fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties.\nAs a condition of approval for marketing our products, governmental authorities may require us to conduct additional studies. In connection with the approval of SOLIRIS we established a PNH Registry and an aHUS Registry to collect additional data on patients. Furthermore, in connection with the approval of STRENSIQ in the U.S., we agreed to conduct a prospective observational study in treated patients to assess the long-term safety of STRENSIQ therapy and to develop complementary assays. In the case of ANDEXXA, it was approved under the FDA\u2019s Accelerated Approval Pathway, and received conditional marketing authorization in the EU based on the change from baseline in anti-Factor Xa activity in healthy volunteers and in patients through the ANNEXA-4 trial demonstrating hemostatic efficacy. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon post-marketing study results that verify that clinical benefit is conferred to patients. In the U.S., the FDA can also propose to withdraw approval for a product if it determines that such additional studies are inadequate or if new clinical data or other information shows that a product is not safe for use in an approved indication.\nIn addition, similar or more stringent post-approval requirements and obligations may be imposed by the FDA and/or other regulatory agencies with respect to any of our future products that obtain regulatory approval. Compliance with these post-approval requirements could result in increased cost and expense and decrease our operating margins and, if we are unable to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to regulatory action\nby the applicable regulatory agency and the penalties may include fines and product withdrawals or restrictions in the use of a product.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, including those related to healthcare fraud and abuse, we may be subject to investigations and civil or criminal penalties and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to healthcare \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, such as the False Claims Act (FCA), the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, laws prohibiting off-label product promotion and other related federal and state laws and regulations.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind to induce, or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. Liability may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it. A conviction for violation of the Anti-kickback Statute requires mandatory exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The majority of states also have statutes similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.\nThe FCA prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Pharmaceutical companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the Federal government under the FCA for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe products (including through the use of speaker programs); engaging in promotion of pharmaceuticals for uses that the FDA has not approved, or \u201coff-label\u201d uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program.\nWe seek to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute and FCA laws, including operating within any available safe harbors, but we cannot assure that our compliance program, policies and procedures will always protect us from acts committed by employees or third-party distributors or service providers.\nThere is also enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. In 2019, we settled an investigation by the Department of Justice relating to our support for 501(c)(3) entities. If we, or our vendors or donation recipients, are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance in the operation of these programs again in the future, we could be subject to significant fines or penalties.\nOther related federal and state laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, among others, the federal False Statements Statute, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the HIPAA criminal federal health care fraud statute, the federal Open Payments program, state anti-kickback and false claims acts, and state and local disclosure requirements and marketing restrictions. Additional information about the scope of these requirements and potential penalties is provided under \u201cGovernment Regulation - Fraud and Abuse\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn recent years, legislation has been adopted at the federal, state and local level requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, health care provider payments and other activities. For example, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the PPACA), the federal government enacted the Open Payments (commonly known as the Sunshine Act) provisions. Open Payments requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to CMS payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, and, for reports submitted on or after January 1, 2022, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. We also now have similar reporting obligations throughout the EU. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements may result in significant civil monetary penalties.\nViolations of U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws (and comparable laws in foreign jurisdictions) may result in criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including fines, damages, civil monetary penalties (which may be material in amount) and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Any action initiated against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could materially\nadversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nFinally, the FDA, the EU and EU Member States and the MHLW, among other regulatory agencies, impose restrictions on the promotion and marketing of drug products and prohibit pharmaceutical manufacturers from promoting products for indications other than those cleared or approved by regulatory authorities or for use in manner that is not consistent with the product label approved by regulatory agencies, or off-label promotion. In certain instances, physicians are, however, in their medical judgment permitted to use products for unapproved purposes and we are aware of such uses of SOLIRIS for example. Although we believe that our marketing materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute improper promotion, the FDA, the DOJ, other federal or state government agencies, the EU, EU Member States or the MHLW (or other foreign regulatory agencies) may disagree. If any governmental authority determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute improper promotion of any of our products, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials (which occurred in 2019 in Japan) or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, product withdrawal or recall, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds.\nOur business and operations may be materially adversely affected by government investigations.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and/or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in countries that are recognized as having a greater potential for governmental and commercial corruption. While we have, and continue to, take steps that are intended to enhance our compliance and training programs, we cannot assure that our compliance program, policies and procedures will always protect us from acts committed by employees or third-parties acting on our behalf.\nIn May 2015, we received a subpoena in connection with an investigation by the Enforcement Division of the SEC requesting information related to our grant-making activities and compliance with the FCPA in various countries, including Brazil, Colombia,\nJapan, Russia and Turkey. In addition, in October 2015, we received a request from the DOJ for the voluntary production of documents and other information pertaining to our compliance with the FCPA. The SEC and DOJ also sought information related to our recalls of specific lots of SOLIRIS and related securities disclosures. DOJ informed us that it closed its inquiry into these matters. We settled the investigation with the SEC in July 2020, and made payment of approximately $21.5 in disgorgement, civil penalties, and pre-judgment interest in connection with the settlement. In addition, following the settlement with the SEC in July 2020, the Ministry of Health in Turkey initiated an investigation regarding the matters referenced in the SEC Order as they relate to the Company\u2019s operations in Turkey between 2010 and 2015 (for more information, see Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We are cooperating with this investigation.\nIn May 2017, Brazilian authorities seized records and data from our Sao Paulo, Brazil offices as part of an investigation being conducted into our Brazilian operations. At this time, we are unable to predict the duration, scope or outcome of the open investigations. In addition, even though we have settled the DOJ investigation relating generally to our support of certain 501(c)(3) organizations that was initiated by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts in December 2016, the SEC investigation (which was settled in July 2020), the DOJ investigation (that was closed by the DOJ in May 2020) and the MHLW closed its 2018 investigation into our Japanese operations, we may be subject to similar investigations in the future by the same or other regulatory agencies and government authorities and the penalties imposed on us may be materially greater in amount or we may be subject to material limitations on our operations, activities and our business. In addition, any remedial actions that have been or will be taken with the intent to address the matters that were the subject of these or other governmental investigations may not prevent future investigations and potential liability as a result of such further investigations.\nAny determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with existing U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, could result in the imposition of a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions against us and certain of our directors, officers and/or employees, including injunctive relief, disgorgement, substantial fines or penalties, imprisonment, and other legal or equitable sanctions, including exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other governmental healthcare programs. Any attempts to resolve some or all of these matters may not be successful. If we were to\nengage in settlement discussions with respect to any current or future investigation or litigation (and we may accrue amounts due to the nature of such discussions), but the matter is not settled, the ultimate resolution may result in monetary or other penalties materially greater or stricter than the amounts or terms that we proposed in discussions (or the amount that we accrued for such matter during negotiations). Additionally, remediation of any such findings resulting from these and any future investigations could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and we could experience interruptions of business, harm to our reputation, debarment from government contracts, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, and necessary licenses and permits could be terminated. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. Cooperating with and responding to requests for information in connection with these ongoing investigations, as well as responding to any future U.S., state or foreign governmental investigation or whistleblower lawsuit, has resulted and could continue to result in substantial expenses, and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and growth prospects.\nOur business could be adversely affected by litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nWe operate in many jurisdictions in a highly regulated industry and we could be subject to litigation, government investigations (as noted above) and enforcement and other legal actions on a variety of matters in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, including, without limitation, intellectual property, regulatory, product liability, tax and custom/import duties, environmental, whistleblower, Qui Tam, false claims, privacy, anti-kickback, anti-bribery, securities, commercial, employment and other claims and legal proceedings which may arise from conducting our business. We are involved in certain legal proceedings from time to time. See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain of these legal proceedings. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions, we may assume potential liability related to pending legal proceedings of the acquired company. For example, securities class action complaints were filed against Portola and certain officers of Portola alleging violation of the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933 due to misrepresentations and omissions in public disclosures concerning sales of andexanet alfa between January 8, 2019 and February 26, 2020. Legal proceedings are inherently\nunpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing, selling, using and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face potential product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products and result in significant monetary liability.\nChanges in healthcare laws and implementing regulations, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may affect coverage and reimbursement of our products in ways that we cannot currently predict and these changes could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn the U.S., there have been a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives focused on containing the cost of healthcare. The PPACA, for example, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the U.S., and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations, in some cases in ways we cannot currently predict. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under health insurance exchanges, expansion of the 340B program, expansion of state Medicaid programs, fraud and abuse enforcement and rules governing the approval of biosimilar and generic products (and allowing biosimilars access to the market in accordance with the FDA\u2019s Biosimilars Action Plan). These changes may impact existing government healthcare programs, industry competition, formulary composition, and may result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives, health technology assessments and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. In 2016, CMS implemented changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the PPACA and promulgated a final regulation in December 2020 implementing further changes to the program, as described in \u201cGovernment Regulation - U.S. Healthcare Reform and Other U.S. and International\nHealthcare Laws\u201d included in Part I, Item 1. Moreover, in the future, Congress could enact legislation that further increases Medicaid drug rebates or other costs and charges associated with participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the MFN Model may ultimately be implemented or the executive branch may issue similar pricing or discount initiatives that impact SOLIRIS or our other products. The issuance of regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program has and may continue to decrease revenues, increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, has been and may be time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSimilar cost-reduction efforts to those in the United States, and in some cases even more aggressive efforts, are being taken by governments to control the costs of pharmaceutical drugs and regulate the industry in countries outside the U.S. In these markets outside the U.S., the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products is subject to direct or indirect governmental control and such government authorities are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of drug products and due to their control over pricing are able to move quickly to implement pricing changes. In certain cases, governments may challenge the price we charge for our products already delivered to patients under applicable regulations in those countries (and if these governments prevail, we could be required to return amounts to the government or the government may take steps in an attempt to claw-back amounts that were previously paid to us and such amounts may be material).\nWe may face uncertainties as a result of federal and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA and with respect to the potential implementation of the MFN Model. There is no assurance that the PPACA or MFN Model, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal, state or foreign legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform may affect our business. The recent COVID-19 pandemic may introduce temporary or permanent healthcare reform measures for which we cannot predict the financial implication on our business.\nState governments have sought to put in place limits and caps on pharmaceutical prices and have also requested rebates for certain pharmaceuticals. Attempts to decrease prices of pharmaceutical products may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs which could lead to managed care organizations influencing\nprescription decisions for beneficiaries and a corresponding limitation on prices and reimbursement for our products.\nGovernments in countries where we operate have adopted or have also shown significant interest in pursuing legislative initiatives to reduce costs of healthcare. We expect that the implementation and enforcement of current laws and policies, the amendment of those laws and policies in the future, as well as the adoption of new laws and policies, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase our product sales or revenues or successfully commercialize our product candidates, or could limit or eliminate our future spending on development projects and product candidates. The announcement or adoption of regulatory or legislative proposals could delay or prevent our entry into new markets, affect our reimbursement or sales in the markets where we are already selling our products and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare, or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and we have obligations to report the average sales price under the Medicare program. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for quantities of our products that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our products under Medicaid and for payment to be available for our products under Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. Any failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment obligations could negatively impact our financial results.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS or other applicable government authorities to be incomplete or incorrect. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. Recalculations\nincrease our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing these programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, and such amount may be material. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products to certain covered entities under the 340B pricing program.\nWe are liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false pricing information to the government, if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, or if we fail to submit the required pricing data on a timely basis. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs and any such actions could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nThe Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program, and other comparable government and payer regulations, may have a negative impact on the price we can charge for our products and result in a decrease in revenues.\nFederal law requires that any manufacturer that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs. The 340B pricing program is described in \u201cGovernment Regulation - Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. We are a participant in the 340B drug pricing program and are, for the applicable covered entities, subject to the price ceiling. Any changes to the 340B drug pricing program, including:\n\u2022the method of calculating the 340B ceiling price for our products;\n\u2022any expansion of the entities that qualify as covered entities; and\n\u2022other programmatic changes\ncould have a material and negative impact our revenue and results of operations.\nPursuant to a final rule adopted on January 1, 2019, we could be subject to civil monetary penalties if the government finds that we knowingly and intentionally overcharged a 340B covered entity. In addition, the 340B pricing program also obligates a manufacturer to offer the 340B price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes the drug available to any other purchaser at any price and to report to the government the ceiling prices for its drugs.\nBeyond the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program, federal law requires that a company must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (FFS) pricing program to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds. If we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or Section 703 Agreement, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we are required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the FCA and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action with respect to our pricing or participation in government health programs, may be expensive, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe may be subject to numerous and varying privacy and security laws, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of personal information including health information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which have affected and may affect our business. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties or sanctions, including criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nIn addition, numerous proposals regarding privacy and data protection are pending before U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies. For example, in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective as of January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General finalized regulations and began enforcement of the CCPA on July 1, 2020. However, obligations under the CCPA also continue to evolve, as the California Attorney General has proposed further modifications to the regulations. Moreover, the CCPA was amended by a ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which was included on the November 2020 ballot in California and approved by California voters. The majority of CPRA provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023 and will require additional investment in compliance programs and potential modifications to business processes.\nNumerous other countries have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information as well. Further, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and implementing laws in the EU member states govern the collection and processing of EU residents\u2019 personal data and, among other requirements, imposes certain consent and data access rights. Such laws may impact, among other things, our ability to conduct clinical trials that involve EU personal data and engage in other activities that require the processing of EU personal data and in particular international transfers of personal data. These laws are complex, subject to interpretation by local authorities, and any determination that we breached such laws could lead to government enforcement actions, significant penalties and these may adversely impact our operating results.\nPrivacy and data protection laws, industry standards, regulations and regulatory enforcement in the U.S. and internationally continue to evolve. In May 2018, the EU\u2019s GDPR, which applies in all EU Member States, went into effect. The regulation introduced comprehensive data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. It increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with evolving EU data protection rules. The GDPR also includes restrictions on the transfers of personal data from the EU to jurisdictions that have not been deemed to provide essentially equivalent data protection safeguards through national laws outside of certain legal transfer mechanisms. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as one means of transferring data to the United States, and called for additional assessments in the context of reliance upon standard contractual clauses. While Alexion was not Privacy\nShield certified, additional compliance efforts may be needed to respond to evolving EU regulatory guidance. Any determination that we are not in compliance with such requirements could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties, which may adversely impact our operations.\nSecurity breaches, cyber-attacks, other disruptions to, or vulnerabilities in, our information technology systems and infrastructure, or those of our clients, partners, counterparties, or other third-party service providers on which we rely, could expose us to liability and affect our business and reputation.\nWe are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We collect, store and transmit sensitive information including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information in connection with business operations. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Some of this information could be an attractive target of criminal attack by third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d patient groups, disgruntled current or former employees and others. Cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, and despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to such attacks or may be breached, including due to employee error or malfeasance. We have implemented information security measures designed to protect patients\u2019 personal information and other corporate information (including proprietary information) against the risk of inappropriate and unauthorized external use and disclosure. However, despite these measures, and due to the ever-changing information cyber-threat landscape, we may be subject to data breaches through cyber-attacks. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. If our information technology systems become compromised, we may not promptly discover the intrusion. Like other companies in our industry, we have experienced attacks to our data and systems, including malware and computer viruses. If our systems failed or were breached or disrupted, we could lose product sales, and suffer reputational damage and loss of customer confidence. Such incidents may result in notification obligations to affected individuals and government agencies, legal claims or proceedings, and liability under foreign, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Our proprietary and confidential information may also be accessed. Any one of these events could cause our business to be materially harmed and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have generally required all employees who are able to work from home to do so until further notice. As a result of these measures, and as our employees continue to work from home and access our systems remotely, we may be subject to heightened information security risks, including the risk of cyber attacks.\nNegative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of recombinant and transgenic products, genetically modified products and genetically modified animals generally may damage public perception of our KANUMA product.\nKANUMA is a transgenic product produced in the egg whites of genetically modified chickens who receive copies of the human lysosomal acid lipase gene to produce recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase. The success of KANUMA may depend, in part, on public attitudes of the use of genetic engineering. Public attitudes may be influenced by claims and perceptions that these types of activities or products are unsafe, and our products may not gain sufficient acceptance by, or fall out of favor with, the public or the medical community. Negative public attitudes to genetic engineering activities in general could result in more restrictive legislation or regulations and could impede our ability to conduct our business, delay preclinical or clinical studies, or otherwise prevent us from commercializing our product.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Many factors could have an impact on our stock price, including fluctuations in our or our competitors\u2019 operating results, clinical trial results or adverse events associated with our products or our competitors' products, product development by us or our competitors, changes in laws, including healthcare, tax or intellectual property laws, intellectual property developments, changes in reimbursement or drug pricing, the existence or outcome of litigation or government proceedings, including the Chugai lawsuits alleging patent infringement, acquisitions or other strategic transactions, and the perceptions of our investors that we are not performing or meeting expectations. In addition, the sales of our common stock by our officers, directors, or by any entities that an officer or director may be affiliated with, may have caused our stock price to drop in the past and any future sales by such officer, director or affiliate (or the perception that such sales could occur) may have a negative impact on our stock price. The trading price of the common stock of many biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, has experienced price and volume fluctuations, which have at times been unrelated to\nthe operating performance of the companies whose stocks were affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult and may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management.\nOur corporate charter and by-law provisions may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control that might be beneficial to us or our stockholders. Our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, the Secretary, or a majority of the Board of Directors, or upon the written request of stockholders who together own of record 25.0% of the outstanding stock of all classes entitled to vote at such meeting. Our bylaws also specify that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors. Our charter does not include a provision for cumulative voting for directors, which may have enabled a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares to elect one or more directors. Under our charter, our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to designate up to five million shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future.\nBecause we are a Delaware corporation, the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control may be beneficial to stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Laws, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15.0% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15.0% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the courts located in the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain an alternate judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternate forum, the state courts located in the State of Delaware (or if no state court within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the State of Delaware) will be the sole and\nexclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on or on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Company Law or the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As a stockholder in our Company, you are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws may limit your ability to obtain an alternate judicial forum for disputes with us.", "PERMNO": 83111, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ALXN"}
