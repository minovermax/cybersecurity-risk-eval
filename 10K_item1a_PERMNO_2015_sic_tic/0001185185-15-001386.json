{"cik": "1001463", "company": "Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-05-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur auditors have issued a going concern opinion with respect to our consolidated financial statements although our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern.\nThe Company has incurred significant losses as a consolidated entity since July 2007, losses that have continued since that time through the close of fiscal 2013. These continuing losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and our auditor's opinion with respect to our financial statements contain a going concern opinion. The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBecause We Have Limited Operating History, it is Difficult to Evaluate Our Business.\nOn July 10, 2013 the Company acquired certain assets that it utilized to begin revenue-producing operations under a new food grade citrus byproducts subsidiary. On March 1, 2014 the Company began milling products under the name Acacia Milling Services in preparation to create a stand-alone billing entity in the future. In July and August of 2014 the Company acquired vehicles and implemented operations at its new Acacia Transport, Inc. subsidiary. As a result of our limited operating history in these businesses, you have very little operating and financial data about us upon which to base an evaluation. You should consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties we may encounter, including those frequently encountered by new companies. If we are unable to execute our plans and grow our business, either as a result of the risks identified in this section or for any other reason, this failure would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business prospects, and financial condition.\nThe purchase of our securities is a purchase of an interest in what should be considered as a high risk venture or in a new or \u201cstart-up\u201d venture with all the unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, and difficulties to which such ventures are subject.\nWe plan to grow through acquisitions\nWe plan to grow through expansion of our new operations, creation of new businesses, acquisitions, and/or mergers, and investors have little current basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target businesses' operations or our ability to identify and integrate acquired operations into our company. Because we intend to develop and expand our business at least in part through selective acquisitions of or mergers with other businesses, there are significant risks that we may not be successful. We may not be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional companies or assets or successfully integrate such additional companies or assets into our Company without substantial costs, delays or other problems. In addition, companies we may acquire may not be profitable at the time of their acquisition or may not achieve levels of profitability that would justify our investment. Acquisitions may involve a number of special risks, including but not limited to:\n\u00d8 adverse short-term effects on our reported operating results,\n\u00d8 diversion of management's attention,\n\u00d8 dependence hiring, training, and retaining key personnel,\n\u00d8 risks associated with unanticipated problems or legal liabilities,\n\u00d8 amortization of acquired intangible assets, some or all of which could reflect poorly on our operating results and financial reports,\n\u00d8 implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls, procedures and policies; and,\n\u00d8 incursion of debt to make acquisitions or for other operating uses.\nTo the extent we complete a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its development stage, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations of those entities. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors.\nWe will seek to implement our acquisition strategy in certain industries that may be considered as mature\nWe may acquire a business in what may be considered a mature industry in which single-digit or low double-digit growth may occur. Most growth for our Company would, accordingly, occur largely through acquisitions. To the extent that competitors are also seeking to grow through acquisitions, we could encounter competition for those acquisitions or a generally increasing price to acquire going concerns.\nA primary part of the Company\u2019s strategy is to establish revenue through the acquisition of or merger with additional companies or operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify, acquire, combine with, or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate the operations of additional companies into those of the Company without encountering substantial costs, delays or other problems. In addition, there can be no assurance that companies acquired in the future will achieve or maintain profitability that justify liabilities that could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or financial condition. The Company may compete for acquisition, merger, and expansion opportunities with companies that have greater resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that suitable acquisition or merger candidates will be available, that purchase terms or financing for acquisitions or mergers will be obtainable on terms acceptable to the Company, that acquisitions or mergers can be consummated, or that acquired businesses can be integrated successfully and profitability into the Company\u2019s operations. Further, the Company's results of operations in fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition or merger could be materially adversely affected while the Company integrates the acquired business into its existing structure.\nThe Company will attempt to acquire or merge with business entities that are going and functioning concerns with a trailing history of profitability, but may acquire or merge with certain businesses that have either been unprofitable, have had inconsistent profitability prior to their acquisition or combination therewith, or that have had no operating history. An inability of the Company to improve the profitability of these acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Finally, the Company's acquisition and merger strategy places significant demands on the Company's resources and there can be no assurance that the Company's management and operational systems and structure can be expanded to effectively support the Company's acquisition strategy. If the Company is unable to successfully implement its acquisition and merger strategy, this inability could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, or financial condition. The Company may face the opportunity to enhance shareholder value by being acquired by another company. Upon any acquisition of the Company, the Company would be subject to various risks, including the replacement of its management by persons currently unknown. There can also be no assurance that, if acquired, new management will be successfully integrated or can profitably manage the Company. In addition, any acquisition or merger of or by the Company may involve immediate dilution to existing shareholders of the Company. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to or desire to be acquired, or be able to acquire or merge with additional companies.\nNeed for Additional Financing\nThe Company does not have adequate capital or resources to fund its operations and other capital needs for the next six months without new revenue sources or additional capital infusion, and there can be no assurance that such funds will become available in amounts sufficient to meet the obligations of our business. The Company may require additional amounts of capital for its future expansion and working capital, possibly from private placements of its common stock or borrowing, but there can be no assurance that such financing will be available, or that such financing will be available on acceptable terms.\nDependence on Key Personnel\nOur future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our Chief Executive Officer, Steven L. Sample and now upon the continued service of William J. Howe, the President of the Company\u2019s new Citrus Extracts, Inc. subsidiary in Fort Pierce, Florida. The loss of either of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The Company does not presently maintain key man life insurance on Mr. Sample or Mr. Howe, but may obtain such insurance at the discretion of its board of directors for such term as it may deem suitable or desirable. Our future success may depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. The competition for such personnel can be intense, and there can be no assurance that we can attract, assimilate or retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel for favorable compensations in the future.\nTechnological Change\nTechnology, particularly the ability to use the Internet to conduct business and allow several management functions, is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service announcements, introductions and enhancements, and changing customer demands. Our future success will to some degree depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, our ability to adapt its solutions to meet evolving industry standards and our ability to improve continually the performance, features and reliability of its solutions. Similarly, the Company must also continue to examine new processes and technologies related to its new citrus byproducts subsidiary. The failure of the Company to adapt successfully to such changes in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful implementation of solutions, or that any new solutions or enhancements to existing solutions will adequately meet the requirements of its current and prospective customers and achieve any degree of significant market acceptance. If the Company is unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new solutions or enhancements to existing solutions in a timely manner or in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, or if its solutions or enhancements do not achieve a significant degree of market acceptance, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition\nAny industry served by the Company is likely to be highly competitive across the entire United States and the rest of the world. The Company has elected to devote the majority of its efforts on sales within the continental United States, but does compete with other companies in diverse countries than can potentially produce and sell its products at lower prices. While the Company believes that there are other hurdles for those foreign entities to scale, including the high cost of international shipping to U.S. buyers, we believe that they nonetheless can compete with us in our markets. We will potentially compete with a variety of companies, both domestic and international, and as such will be subject to various levels of competition. There is no assurance the Company will be able to adhere to its plans or to engage in any acquisitions or mergers at all. As a result of its agreement with Uncle Matt\u2019s Organic, Inc., Florida\u2019s largest organic Juice producer, the Company believes it can compete as a manufacturer and supplier of organic food grade citrus peel products. The Company has several buyers of its product in diverse areas of the United States, and is currently fielding opportunities to sell or distribute its products to other buyers. In addition, the Company attended an organic trade show in Europe in early 2014 in an effort to establish clients in Europe and other venues, although it does not expend great energies in those areas and does not expect to see a significant amount of international business in its portfolio.\nControl\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors owns a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities which could reduce the ability of minority shareholders to effect certain corporate actions.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Director, Steven Sample, owned 47.24% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2013. As a result, currently, and after an offering by the Company of its equity securities, he will possess significant influence and can elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate transactions. His effective control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer.\nAs of that same date, all officers and directors of the Company owned a combined 52.05% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock. Based upon the Company's current business plan, it is anticipated that Mr. Sample will continue to have substantial influence over, if not effective control over the Company\u2019s operations in the near future, including the election of a majority of its board of directors, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities, and other matters of corporate governance, perhaps even after some potential subsequent issuances by the Company of new common shares for capital raising activities, acquisitions, or merger activities.\nWe may, in the future, issue additional shares of common stock, which would reduce investors\u2019 percent of ownership and may dilute our share value.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of 150,000,000 shares of common stock. The future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock\nManagement of Growth\nThe Company is continually seeking to identify and acquire viable businesses. As a result, the Company must manage relationships with a growing number of third parties as it seeks to accommodate this goal. The Company's management, personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support the Company\u2019s future operations. The Company's ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to continue to expand its operating and financial procedures and controls, to replace or upgrade its operational, financial and management information systems and to attract, train, motivate, manage and retain key employees. If the Company's executives are unable to manage growth effectively, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If successful in acquiring or combining with other operations, the Company anticipates it may inherit a substantial portion of the staff necessary to operate the new entities, but there is no assurance that will happen, or that if it does happen, that the staff will remain employed by the Company for any period of time. We may find that some of the personnel and management of any acquisition target(s) may not be suitable for continued employment, while other suitable candidates may elect to discontinue their employment or affiliation with the Company for various reasons. This can create a burden on the Company\u2019s management as it seeks to fill key positions. Failure of the Company to do so in a timely manner can result in disruption of operations, loss of revenues, and an attendant reduction in profits or even substantial losses.\nRisks Associated with Expansion\nThe Company desires to start, acquire or combine with other businesses, perhaps in diverse locations and markets. To date, the Company does not have substantial experience in developing services on a regional or national scale. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to deploy successfully its goods or services in those markets. There are certain risks inherent in doing business in several diverse markets, such as; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, potentially adverse tax consequences, local restrictions, controls relating to inter-company communications and technology, difficulties in staffing and managing distant operations, fluctuations in manpower availability, effects of local competition, weather and climactic trends, and customer preferences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the success of the Company's operations and, consequently, on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nProduct and Service Offerings\nOn July 10, 2013, the Company acquired certain assets and, though its Citrus Extracts, Inc. (\u201cCEI\u201d) subsidiary, entered the citrus peel byproducts manufacturing business. The Company\u2019s CEI subsidiary utilizes our chemical-free, 100% natural processes in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of all-natural food-grade ingredients made from raw, fresh, natural citrus peel resulting from citrus juicing operations. Through its trade secret processes, CEI processes and dehydrates orange, lemon, grapefruit and tangerine peel as CitraBlend and CitraBlend then mills it to varying sizes from \u201ccut & sift flakes\u201d to 40+ mesh powders (or smaller sizes for custom orders). These ingredients, both organic and non-organic, find their ways into many national brand-name products commonly found on America\u2019s kitchen tables in the form of spices, teas, national brand beer, specialty beverages, and otherwise. In addition to a national label beer, our products are found in many craft beers, and because we have only recently addressed that market it remains largely untapped. CitraBlend is currently primarily sold through a distributor network with emphasis on those industries.\nIn addition to our standard non-organic line of products, our Citrus Extracts subsidiary began manufacturing organic citrus ingredient products in larger quantities effective with the beginning of January 2014. The Company secures it source material (fresh citrus peel) directly from a citrus peel processor less than 20 miles from its manufacturing facility, also obtaining is fresh organic peel from that plant in conjunction with its juice processing operations for Uncle Matt\u2019s Organic Juice Company-Florida\u2019s largest organic juice manufacturer. All our food grade products are gluten free, non-gmo, certified Kosher, and in the case our organic products, bear our USDA National Organic Certification.\nOn January 15, 2014, the Company formed a new Florida corporation, Acacia Transport Services, Inc. (\u201cATS\u201d), for the purposes of utilizing that corporation to house new subsidiary operations and to receive certain acquired assets. On July 2, 2014, ATS executed an exclusive agreement with Lambeth Groves Juice Company in Vero Beach, Florida to obtain all the raw citrus peel resulting from its juice extraction operations beginning July 30, 2014, and concomitant with that same time the Company acquired several road tractors and trailers for use in transporting the raw citrus peel for use at the Company\u2019s Citrus Extracts, Inc. manufacturing subsidiary and for disposing of excess peel to farmers. ATS hauled its first loads of raw citrus peel from Lambeth Groves on August 7, 2014 and thereafter as it became available.\nOn March 1, 2014 the Company began performing milling operations using the trade name Acacia Milling Services at the Fort Pierce location for its Citrus Extracts subsidiary. Milling is the term applied to grinding or refining the finished citrus ingredient products rendered by Citrus Extracts into smaller, finer particles. These services vary from simple sifting operations that separate the various sizes of materials to creating specific cuts from the original material, such as \u201ctea bag cut\u201d size, granulated materials of various sizes, or \u201cpowders\u201d of various mesh sizes. Generally the greater the mesh size (finer, smaller, particle size) requested by the customer, the higher the milling charges per pound. The Company does not currently maintain separate accounting functions for its new milling operations, but intends to further segregate those milling operations in 2015 and to implement a new system of segregated financial reporting for those operations. The Company also intends to expand its offerings of those milling services to outside parties for the generation of additional revenues in the future.\nThe Company may seek to start, acquire, or combine with other service or non-service entities, including those involved in manufacturing, transportation, distribution, chemical products, or otherwise. It is important to our future success to expand the breadth and depth of our offerings to be competitive and to enhance our potentials for growth of revenues and profits. Expansion of our categories and offerings in this manner will require significant additional expenditures and could strain our management, financial and operational resources. For example, we may find it prudent to acquire or build, outfit, and operate a new manufacturing facility or to initiate a new transport subsidiary where one is not currently available. We cannot be certain that we would be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner or that we would be able to offer certain products or services in demand by our customers, or to do so in a quality manner. Furthermore, any new product or service offering that is not favorably received by the Company\u2019s clients could damage our reputation. The lack of market acceptance of new products or services or our inability to generate satisfactory revenues from expanded product or service offerings to offset their costs could harm our business. If we do not successfully expand our sales operations, our revenues may fall below expectations. If we do not successfully expand our operations on an ongoing basis to accommodate increases in demand, we will not be able to fulfill our customers\u2019 needs in a timely manner, which would harm our business. Most of our product or service operations are anticipated to be handled at our facilities, but some services may be performed at offsite locations or by approved vendors or contractors. Any future expansion may cause disruptions in our business and may be insufficient to meet our ongoing requirements. The Company may move into various businesses as sales, manufacturing, transport, marketing, or otherwise, and is not limited to considering only product or service business offering. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying new businesses, or if it can be successful in acquiring or merging with any new business if identified.\nGovernment Regulation and Legal Uncertainties\nAny new legislation or regulation, or the application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to the Company's business could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCheck, Credit Card, and Other Fraud\nOur business could be harmed if we experience significant credit, wire transfer, draft, check, credit card, or other fraud. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent transactions, our revenues and results of operations could be harmed. The Company may attempt to obtain insurance as partial protections from such potential losses, but even while the Company\u2019s exposure to loss in this event may be limited by the purchase of any such insurance, losses could nonetheless occur. Any losses sustained as a result of fraud or fraudulent activity would adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations, and its financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nLiability Claims\nThe Company may face costly liability claims by consumers or other businesses. Any claim of liability by a client, employee, consumer or other entity against us, regardless of merit, could be costly financially and could divert the attention of our management. It could also create negative publicity, which would harm our business. Although we maintain certain forms of liability insurance, it may not provide protections in the event of certain liability claims, or may not be sufficient to cover a covered claim if one is made.\nRisks of Low Priced Stocks\nFollowing its initial public offering of its common stock in 1996, the Company\u2019s shares were originally traded on the NASDAQ Exchange into 2000 as Gibbs Construction, Inc. under the trading symbol GBSE. Gibbs encountered severe financial difficulties in 2000, after which it was moved from the NASDAQ Capital Markets to the OTC Pink Sheets. Following the resurrection of the Company\u2019s operations in 2007 through the intervention and assistance of the Company\u2019s current CEO, Mr. Sample, its stock currently trades on the OTCQB exchange under the trading symbol ACCA. Most of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common shares continue to be restricted shares resulting in a small \u201cfloat\u201d. For that and other reasons the Company\u2019s securities have been thinly traded, and while a trading market for the Company's common stock could develop further with its current or new operations and the further release of restrictions on registered shares, there can be no assurance that it will do so.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d) has adopted regulations which define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security, such as those of the Company, that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. In the event the Company determined to offer its common stock for sale, or elected to utilize its common stock in an acquisition of merger transaction, it would be required to advise the potential purchasers or parties to any such acquisition or merger transaction of the risks of penny stocks. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock by a retail customer, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange commission relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about commissions payable to both the broker/dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Accordingly, market makers may be less inclined to participate in marketing the Company\u2019s securities, which may have an adverse impact upon the liquidity of the Company\u2019s securities.\nIf the Company were successful in identifying a new business opportunity and/or identifying an acquisition or merger target, became successful in actually launching a new business or acquiring or merging with any such target, and was successful in bringing profitable operations to the Company, it would intend to seek to meet the new listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital market and attempt to return to that Exchange, which listing requirements include minimal capitalization, share price, and other benchmark requirements. There is no assurance the Company can successfully identify any suitable new business opportunity, acquisition or merger candidate, or if successful in identifying a new business opportunity or merger/acquisition candidate, that it can be successful in developing a new business or completing any acquisition or merger, or if successful in developing a new business or completing any acquisition or merger that the Company could be successful in meeting the new listing requirements of the NASDAQ, or if successful in meeting those requirements, that the NASDAQ would accept the Company as a member, or that if the Company were successful in achieving a listing on the NASDAQ exchange that its share values would improve. Any attempt to return to the NASDAQ Exchange, even if the Company were successful in meeting the requirements to do so, could take as long as two years or more to complete.\nNo Assurance of Payment of Dividends\nShould the Company acquire additional operations, and should the operations of the Company become profitable, it is likely that the Company would retain much or all of its earnings in order to finance future growth and expansion. Therefore, the Company does not presently intend to pay dividends, and it is not likely that any dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future.\nPotential Future Capital Needs\nThe Company may not be successful in generating sufficient cash from its new revenue-producing operations or in raising capital in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms to meet its capital needs. The failure to generate sufficient cash flows or to raise sufficient funds may require the Company to delay or abandon some or all of its development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities, and may make it difficult for the Company to respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. While the Company may seek to raise capital through the offering of common stock, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing so, or if successful in raising capital that the proceeds in any such offering will be sufficient to permit the Company to implement its proposed business plan, or that any assumptions relating to the implementation of such plan will prove to be accurate. To the extent that the proceeds of any such offering are not sufficient to enable the Company to generate sufficient revenues or achieve profitable operations, the inability to obtain additional financing will have a material adverse effect on the Company. There can be no assurance that any such financing will be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that the Company will be successful in finding new operations.\nImplementation of Business Plan\nThe Company currently does not have sufficient working capital to pursue our business plan in its entirety as described herein. Our ability to implement our business plan will depend on our ability to obtain sufficient working capital and to execute its business plans. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain additional capital, or, if available, that such capital will be available at terms acceptable to us, or that we will be able to generate profit from operations, or if profits are generated, that they will be sufficient to carry out our business plans, or that the plans will not be modified.\nBased upon the Company's current business plan, it is anticipated that the Company\u2019s CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Steven Sample, will continue to have substantial influence over, if not effective control over the Company\u2019s operations in the near future, including the election of a majority of its board of directors, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities, and other matters of corporate governance, perhaps even after some potential subsequent issuances by the Company of new common shares for capital raising activities, acquisitions, or merger activities.
