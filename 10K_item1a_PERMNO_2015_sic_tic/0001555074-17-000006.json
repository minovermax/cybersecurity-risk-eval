{"cik": "1555074", "company": "Altisource Asset Management Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history. If we are unable to implement our business strategy as planned, we will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe commenced operations in 2012, and our business model is relatively untested and evolving. Businesses like ours that have a limited operating history and a limited client base present substantial business and financial risks and may suffer significant losses. As a result, we cannot predict our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of our results for any future period, and we may not have sufficient additional capital to implement our business model. There can be no assurance that our business will be profitable or that it will be sustainable. The earnings potential of our proposed business is unproven, and the absence of an operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects. We may not be able to implement our business strategy as planned, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nFailure of RESI to achieve desired results could result in drastically reduced management fees to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn March 2015, we entered into the Current AMA with RESI. The Current AMA, which became effective on April 1, 2015, provides for a new management fee structure, which replaces the fee structure under the Original AMA as described under \u201cItem 1. Business - Asset Management Agreement.\u201d The three components of the fee structure are the Base Management Fee, which ranges from 1.5% to 2.0% of RESI\u2019s average invested capital (as defined in the Current AMA), the Conversion Fee, which is 1.5% of the market value of the single-family homes leased by RESI for the first time during the quarter, and the Incentive Management Fee, which ranges from 20% to 25% of the amount by which RESI\u2019s return on invested capital (based on AFFO as defined in the Current AMA) exceeds an annual hurdle return rate of between 7.0% and 8.25% (depending on the 10-year treasury rate). To the extent RESI has an aggregate shortfall in its return rate over the previous seven quarters, that aggregate return rate shortfall gets added to the normal quarterly 1.75% return hurdle for the next quarter before we are entitled to an Incentive Management Fee.\nSince the effective date of the Current AMA, we have not yet earned any Incentive Management Fees because RESI has not achieved a return in invested capital, as defined in the Current AMA, of greater than 1.75% in any quarter since April 1, 2015. In addition, since RESI\u2019s performance has resulted in shortfalls of the 1.75% return on invested capital for the past seven quarters, those shortfalls have been added to the return on invested capital RESI must achieve before entitling us to an Incentive Management Fee. We cannot be certain as to whether or when we will earn an Incentive Management Fee under the Current AMA. If RESI is unable to achieve a return on invested capital that entitles us to earn an Incentive Management Fee, our operating results and financial condition would be significantly limited, which absent additional new revenue streams, could materially and adversely affect us.\nRESI is our primary client, and we are primarily reliant on RESI to generate our revenues. A loss of RESI as a client and/or our inability to obtain or develop new clients would materially adversely affect us.\nRESI currently is our primary customer. The loss of this key customer or its failure to pay us would adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Despite RESI\u2019s or our efforts, RESI may fail to substantially grow or have adverse financial performance for a number of reasons including, without limitation, failure to maintain adequate liquidity, an inability to grow through equity offerings and/or debt facilities, generation of poor or inadequate returns or an inability to, or substantial delays in, growing or monetizing its portfolio. Under the Current AMA, neither party is entitled to terminate the Current AMA prior to the end of the initial term or each renewal term. However, RESI has the ability to terminate us (a) \u201cfor cause\u201d for certain events such as a material breach of the Current AMA and failure to cure such breach, (b) for certain other reasons such as its failure to achieve a return on invested capital of at least 7.0% for two consecutive fiscal years after the third anniversary of the Current AMA or (c) in connection with certain change of control events. There can be no assurance that RESI will not be entitled to terminate us prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term, particularly after April 2018, if RESI\u2019s results do not achieve the required returns for two consecutive years. RESI may also make a decision to abandon the\n(table of contents)\nsingle-family rental business, which may have the constructive effect of terminating the Current AMA or drastically reducing our fees under the Current AMA.\nWe may not be able to obtain or develop additional clients on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to attract, develop and/or maintain additional clients may depend, in large part, on the success of RESI under our management and our ability to continue to develop and implement RESI\u2019s business plan profitably and enable RESI to maintain and grow its shareholder returns and dividends. We may be unable to reduce our reliance on RESI for management fees, and our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition and could adversely affect our ability to attract additional clients and the sustainability of our business model.\nThe success of our business is dependent on RESI and its ongoing access to sufficient and cost-effective sources of capital.\nRESI may require additional working capital to implement its investment strategies and may need to utilize a variety of funding sources to provide sufficient capital to effectively carry out its business plan over the long term. We will have significant responsibilities in advising RESI on its capital raising activities. Our success is dependent on RESI's ability to obtain such capital. RESI utilizes various sources of liquidity, including, without limitation, accessing the capital markets to issue debt or equity securities; engaging in collateralized or other borrowings, including repurchase agreements and warehouse facilities from third party banks; or entering into securitization transactions, all or any of which may not be available or have terms that are not cost effective, therefore having an adverse impact on RESI's financial performance. RESI currently is our primary customer. The loss of this key customer or its failure to pay us would adversely affect our revenues, results of operation and financial condition. We may not be able to obtain additional clients on acceptable terms or at all. Therefore, we may be unable to reduce our reliance on RESI for management fees.\nThe asset management business is intensely competitive.\nThe asset management business is intensely competitive, driven by a variety of factors, including asset performance, the quality of service provided to clients, brand recognition and business reputation. Our asset management business competes with a number of other asset managers. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:\n\u2022\na number of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do;\n\u2022\nour clients may not perform as well as the clients of our competitors;\n\u2022\nseveral of our competitors and their clients have significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar management objectives to ours, which may create additional competition for management opportunities;\n\u2022\nsome of these competitors' clients may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to our clients, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to funding opportunities;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors' clients may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to facilitate the acquisition and management by their clients of a wider variety of assets and allow them to advise their clients to bid more aggressively than our clients for assets on which we would advise our clients to bid;\n\u2022\nthere are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new asset management firms, and the successful efforts of new entrants into the asset management business is expected to continue to result in increased competition;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by potential clients as having better expertise with regard to specific assets and\n\u2022\nother industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit members of our management team and other employees away from us.\nSuboptimal economics of real estate-related insurance activities, or a failure to commence and/or grow the business of NewSource could adversely impact our investment in NewSource.\nWe invested $2.0 million in 100% of the common stock of NewSource during 2013, and we invested an additional $5.0 million in 2015. Despite the commencement in 2014 of NewSource\u2019s title reinsurance business operations, NewSource determined that the economics of the initial business activities did not warrant the continuation of its initial reinsurance quota share agreement with an unrelated third party. NewSource therefore transferred all of the risk of claims and future losses underwritten to an unrelated third party for a price of $3.2 million.\nWe are continuing to evaluate NewSource's real estate related insurance and reinsurance strategy and considering related opportunities. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop or grow NewSource's business strategy or operations or\n(table of contents)\nengage in insurance and reinsurance activities at all. In any such event, the business model for NewSource would become challenged or the growth of NewSource would become hampered, which would adversely affect the economics of our investment in NewSource and/or generate stockholder returns to us.\nWe are subject to the risks of securities laws liability and related civil litigation.\nWe may be subject to risk of securities litigation and derivative actions from time to time as a result of being publicly traded, including the remaining unresolved actions set forth in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d There can be no assurance that any settlement or liabilities in such actions or any future lawsuits or claims against us would be covered or partially covered by our insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in one or more periods. While we and our Board of Directors deny the allegations of wrongdoing against us in the unresolved actions initiated against us, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome or timing of their resolutions. The range of possible resolutions could include determinations and judgments against us or settlements that could require substantial payments by us, including the costs of defending such suits, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. An adverse resolution of any future lawsuits or claims against us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nAn unidentified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. In the past, we had identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. There can be no assurance that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future or that any past or future remediation efforts will be successful. If additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls are discovered in the future, we could be required to restate our financial results or experience a decline in the price of our securities.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\nOur success depends on our senior management team, and if we are not able to retain them, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are highly dependent upon the continued services and experience of our senior management team. We depend on the services of members of our senior management team to, among other things, continue the development and implementation of our growth strategies and maintain and develop our client relationships. In the event that, for any reason, we are unable to retain our key personnel, it may be difficult for us to secure suitable replacements on acceptable terms. This would adversely impact the development and implementation of our growth strategies.\nThe continuing unpredictability of the credit markets may restrict our clients' or our access to capital and may make it difficult or impossible for us to obtain any required additional financing.\nThe domestic and international credit markets continue to be unpredictable. In the event that we need additional capital for our business, we may have a difficult time obtaining it and/or the terms upon which we can obtain it would have an adverse impact on our financial performance. In addition, failures of our clients to raise capital or access capital markets could adversely impact their ability to grow and/or generate adequate returns on capital, which could adversely impact any management fees we earn.\n(table of contents)\nOur business could be significantly impacted if we suffer failure or disruptions of our information systems.\nWe rely heavily on communications, data processing and other information processing systems to conduct our business and support our day-to-day activities, most services of which are provided through ASPS. Thus, our business requires the continued operation of ASPS's sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. These systems are vulnerable to interruption by fire, loss, system malfunction and other events that are beyond our control. Systems interruptions could reduce our ability to provide our services and could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. Our inability to replace or successfully replicate these information services from a third party or develop them internally could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to retain the tax benefits provided by the United States Virgin Islands would adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the United States Virgin Islands and are headquartered in the United States Virgin Islands (\u201cUSVI\u201d). The USVI has an Economic Development Commission (the \u201cEDC\u201d) that provides benefits (\u201cEDC Benefits\u201d) to certain qualified businesses in the USVI that enable us to avail ourselves of significant tax benefits for a thirty year period. We received our certificate to operate as a company that qualifies for EDC Benefits as of February 1, 2013, which provides us with a 90% credit on our taxes so long as we comply with the requirements of the EDC and our certificate of benefits. It is possible that we may not be able to retain our qualifications for the EDC Benefits or that changes in U.S. federal, state, local, territorial or USVI taxation statutes or applicable regulations may cause a reduction in or an elimination of the EDC Benefits, all of which could result in a significant increase to our tax expense, and, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to United States federal income taxation.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the USVI and intend to operate in a manner that will cause us to be treated as not engaging in a trade or business within the United States, which will cause us to be exempt from current United States federal income taxation on our net income. However, because there are no definitive standards provided by the Code, regulations or court decisions as to the specific activities that constitute being engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, and as any such determination is essentially factual in nature, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not successfully assert that we are engaged in a trade or business within the United States.\nIf the IRS were to successfully assert that we have been engaged in a trade or business within the United States in any taxable year, various adverse tax consequences could result, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may become subject to current United States federal income taxation on our net income from sources within the United States;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to United States federal income tax on a portion of our net investment income, regardless of its source;\n\u2022\nwe may not be entitled to deduct certain expenses that would otherwise be deductible from the income subject to United States taxation and\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to United States branch profits tax on profits deemed to have been distributed out of the United States.\nUnited States persons who own shares may be subject to United States federal income taxation on our undistributed earnings and may recognize ordinary income upon disposition of shares.\nSignificant potential adverse United States federal income tax consequences generally apply to any United States person who owns shares in a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d). We cannot provide assurance that we will not be a PFIC in any future taxable year.\nIn general, we would be a PFIC for a taxable year if either (i) 75% or more of its income constitutes \u201cpassive income\u201d or (ii) 50% or more of our assets produce \u201cpassive income.\u201d Passive income generally includes interest, dividends and other investment income. We believe that we are currently operating and intend to continue operating our business in a way that should not cause us to be a deemed PFIC; however, we cannot assure you the IRS will not successfully challenge this conclusion.\n(table of contents)\nUnited States persons who, directly or indirectly or through attribution rules, own 10% or more of our shares (\u201cUnited States 10% Shareholders\u201d), may be subject to the controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d) rules. Under the CFC rules, each United States 10% Shareholder must annually include his pro rata share of the CFC's \u201csubpart F income,\u201d even if no distributions are made. In general, with respect to insurance revenues related to NewSource, we will be treated as a CFC only if United States 10% Shareholders collectively own more than 25% of the total combined voting power or total value of our shares for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during any year. With respect to all other revenues, we will be treated as a CFC only if United States 10% Shareholders collectively own more than 50% of the total combined voting power or total value of our shares for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during any year. We believe that the dispersion of our ordinary shares among holders will generally prevent shareholders who acquire shares from being United States 10% Shareholders. We cannot assure you, however, that these rules will not apply to you. If you are a United States person, we strongly urge you to consult your own tax adviser concerning the CFC rules.\nUnited States tax-exempt organizations who own shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income.\nIf you are a United States tax-exempt organization, you may recognize unrelated business taxable income with respect to our insurance-related income if a portion of our subpart F income is allocated to you. In general, subpart F income will be allocated to you if we are a CFC and you are a United States 10% Shareholder and certain exceptions do not apply. In general, with respect to insurance revenues related to NewSource, we will be treated as a CFC only if United States 10% Shareholders collectively own more than 25% of the total combined voting power or total value of our shares for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during any year. Although we do not believe that any United States persons will be allocated subpart F income, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. If you are a United States tax-exempt organization, we advise you to consult your own tax adviser regarding the risk of recognizing unrelated business taxable income.\nChange in United States tax laws may be retroactive and could subject us and/or United States persons who own shares to United States income taxation on our undistributed earnings.\nThe tax laws and interpretations regarding whether we are engaged in a United States trade or business, are a CFC or a PFIC are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming from the IRS. We are not able to predict if, when or in what form such guidance will be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect.\nThe impact of the initiative of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in the United States Virgin Islands.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition. These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. While the USVI is currently a jurisdiction that has substantially implemented internationally agreed tax standards, we are not able to predict if additional requirements will be imposed and, if so, whether changes arising from such additional requirements will subject us to additional taxes.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nWe maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial or other intermediary institutions. The combined account balances at each institution typically exceed FDIC insurance coverage of $250,000 per depositor, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. At December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of approximately $40.0 million at financial institutions in excess of FDIC insured limits. Any event that would cause a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions to be uninsured by the FDIC could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Management and Our Relationships\nWe could have conflicts with RESI. In addition, our former Chairman, other members of our Board of Directors or management could have conflicts of interest due to his, her or their relationship with ASPS, Ocwen Financial Corporation or RESI, which may be resolved in a manner adverse to us.\nWe have engaged, and continue to engage, in a substantial amount of business with RESI. Conflicts may arise between RESI and us because of our ongoing agreement with RESI and because of the nature of our respective businesses.\n(table of contents)\nPrior to his stepping down from the Board of Directors in January 2015, our former Chairman was also the Chairman of RESI, ASPS, Ocwen Financial Corporation (\u201cOcwen\u201d). As a result, he had obligations to us as well as to these other entities, which potentially could have resulted in conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and RESI, ASPS or Ocwen, as the case may be. Our former Chairman also has substantial investments in RESI, ASPS and Ocwen. Such ownership interests may have created, or appeared to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and RESI, ASPS and Ocwen, as the case may be.\nEach of our executive officers is also an executive officer of RESI and has interests in our relationship with RESI that may be different than the interests of our stockholders. As a result, they may have obligations to us and RESI and could have conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and RESI. In particular, these individuals have a direct interest in the financial success of RESI that may encourage these individuals to support strategies in furtherance of the financial success of RESI that could potentially adversely impact us.\nWe follow policies, procedures and practices to avoid potential conflicts with respect to our dealings with RESI, including where necessary, certain of our officers recusing themselves from discussions on, and approvals of transactions with RESI. We also manage potential conflicts of interest through oversight by independent members of our Board of Directors (independent directors constitute a majority of our Board of Directors), and we will also seek to manage these potential conflicts through dispute resolution and other provisions of our agreements with RESI. Although we continue to seek ways to lessen many of these potential conflicts of interest, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective, that we will be able to resolve all conflicts with RESI or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with a third party that had none of the connections we have with RESI.\nOur Directors have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as ours.\nOur Directors may have other investments and business activities in addition to their interest in, and responsibilities to, us. Under the provisions of our Charter and our bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d), our Directors have no duty to abstain from exercising the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as ours or employ or otherwise engage any of the other Directors. If any of our Directors who are also directors, officers or employees of any company acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity outside of his capacity as one of our Directors, then our Bylaws provide that such Director will be permitted to pursue that corporate opportunity independently of us, so long as the Director has acted in good faith. Our Bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such a Director will be deemed to have satisfied his fiduciary duties to us and will not be liable to us for pursuing such a corporate opportunity independently of us. This may create conflicts of interest between us and certain of our Directors and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our stockholders. As of this date, none of our Directors is directly involved as a director, officer or employee of a business that competes with us, but there can be no assurance that will remain unchanged in the future.\nRisks related to our common stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nThe price at which our common stock trades has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, significantly. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to many things, including but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nvariations in actual or anticipated results of our operations, liquidity or financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or the failure to meet, our financial estimates or those of by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nactions or announcements by our competitors;\n\u2022\npotential conflicts of interest, or the discontinuance of our strategic relationships with RESI, ASPS and/or MSR;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated accounting problems;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions;\n\u2022\nlack of liquidity;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial condition or stock price of RESI;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market outlook for the real estate, mortgage or housing markets;\n\u2022\ntechnology changes in our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates that lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher yield;\n\u2022\nactions by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n(table of contents)\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown or dislocation in the global credit markets;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT;\n\u2022\nfailure of RESI to qualify or maintain qualification as a REIT;\n\u2022\nfailure of RESI to maintain its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\npassage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry; and\n\u2022\ndeparture of our key personnel.\nThe market prices of securities of asset management service providers have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of these companies. These market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nFurthermore, our small size and different investment characteristics may not continue to appeal to our current investor base that may seek to dispose of large amounts of our common stock. There is no assurance that there will be sufficient buying interest to offset those sales, and, accordingly, the market price of our common stock could be depressed and/or experience periods of high volatility.\nRisks to Us Related to RESI\u2019s Business Risks and Operating Performance\nRESI is our primary source of revenue and will drive our potential future growth. Any risk associated with RESI's business that would adversely affect its ability to generate revenue and pay distributions to its shareholders is a risk to our business, as our revenues, results of operations and financial condition significantly depend upon the management fees paid to us by RESI. Any risk that ultimately adversely affects RESI could adversely affect the revenues we can generate under the asset management agreement, our results of operations and our financial condition. The risks related to RESI\u2019s business are provided below.\nRESI has a limited and evolving operating history. If RESI is unable to implement its business strategy as planned, it will be materially and adversely affected.\nRESI commenced operations approximately four years ago, and its business model is relatively untested and evolving. Businesses like RESI\u2019s that have a limited operating history present substantial business and financial risks and may suffer significant losses. As a result we cannot predict RESI\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. RESI only began to generate residential rental revenue during 2013, and its historical financial results have been largely attributable to purchasing residential mortgage loans and other rental-related assets at a discount. As a result of the changes to its acquisition strategy and evolving market conditions, RESI has not completed any residential mortgage loan portfolio acquisitions since 2014, RESI may not pursue further acquisitions of such loans. Further, there can be no assurance that RESI will be able to identify and successfully acquire portfolios of SFR properties or related assets on favorable terms or at all.\nWe anticipate significant growth in RESI's rental portfolio, which may result in our inability to effectively grow to meet RESI's business demands or manage its rental portfolio, including, but not limited to, delays in renovations, poor tenant selection and other operational inefficiencies that could reduce RESI's profitability or damage its reputation. Generally, we expect that RESI's SFR portfolios may grow at an uneven pace, if at all, as opportunities to acquire SFR portfolios on acceptable terms may be irregularly timed and may involve large or small portfolios of single-family rental properties. The timing and extent of RESI's success in acquiring such assets cannot be predicted due to market conditions, limited financial resources or other constraints.\nCommencing in 2015, we began to package and sell portfolios of non-performing loans to unaffiliated third parties for RESI. We will continue to evaluate the opportunistic sale of additional portfolios of non-performing loans in the future for RESI subject to RESI's Board or Investment Committee approval. The timing and extent of RESI's success in selling such assets on acceptable terms or at all cannot be predicted due to market conditions, including the demand for residential mortgage loans. It is anticipated that the proceeds generated from such transactions will be utilized, in part, to facilitate RESI's strategy to purchase SFR properties either in bulk or on an individual basis. RESI's inability to sell portfolios of residential mortgage loans on acceptable terms and/or in accordance with its preferred timing could potentially cause a strain on its liquidity, and RESI may be forced to reduce prices, continue to hold such residential mortgage loans at less than ideal leverage ratios and/or bear other costs, which could materially and adversely affect RESI's financial condition and its ability to make further acquisitions.\nThe success of RESI's loan resolution efforts remains an important aspect of its business. It could take longer than originally expected, and therefore be more costly, for a significant portion of loans in any given portfolio to be converted into SFR properties or an underlying property to be liquidated or sold. Accordingly, if RESI is not able to generate sufficient cash flows\n(table of contents)\nfrom its loan resolution activities, it may not have cash available for distribution to its stockholders for an extended period of time.\nAs a result of the foregoing developments, results from prior periods are not necessarily indicative of RESI's results for any future period, and RESI may not have sufficient additional capital to implement its business model. There can be no assurance that RESI's business will remain profitable or that its profitability will be sustainable. Any of these adverse consequences would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business prospects.\nRESI is operating in an emerging industry, and the long-term viability of its investment strategy on an institutional scale is unproven.\nLarge-scale institutional investment in single-family residential homes for rent is a relatively recent phenomenon that has emerged out of the mortgage and housing crisis that began in late 2007. Prior to that time, single-family rental homes were generally not viewed as viable assets for investment on a large scale by institutional investors. Consequently, the long-term viability of the SFR property investment strategy on an institutional scale has not yet been proven. As a participant in this emerging industry, RESI is subject to the risk that SFR properties may not prove to be a viable long-term investment strategy on an institutional scale for a permanent capital vehicle. If it turns out that this investment strategy is not a viable one, RESI would be materially and adversely affected and may not be able to sustain the growth of its assets and results from operations that it seeks.\nRESI's failure to raise equity capital and/or obtain adequate debt financing could adversely affect its ability to increase its rental portfolio, manage its existing assets and generate stockholder returns.\nRESI's success has been, may continue to be, largely dependent on its ability to raise equity capital and obtain debt financing to increase the size of its rental portfolio, manage its existing assets and generate attractive stockholder returns. RESI requires significant financial resources and relies on cost-effective leverage to maintain its obligations under its debt facilities and to continue to acquire portfolios of SFR properties. If RESI is unable to continue to raise equity capital, or leverage its portfolio through financing facilities, its current portfolio and cash from operations may become inadequate to meet its financial obligations, and any such failures would have a material adverse impact on the management fees we earn under the Current AMA.\nRESI may not be able to successfully operate its business or generate sufficient operating cash flows to make or sustain distributions to its stockholders.\nThere can be no assurance that RESI will be able to successfully operate its business or generate sufficient cash to make distributions to its stockholders. RESI's ability to make or sustain distributions to its stockholders depends on many factors, including the following: the availability of attractive risk-adjusted investment opportunities that satisfy its investment strategy and its success in identifying and consummating such opportunities on favorable terms; the level and expected movement of home prices; the occupancy rates and rent levels of rental properties; the restoration, maintenance, marketing and other operating costs related to its SFR and REO properties; the level and volatility of interest rates; our ability to effectively manage a significant increase in the number of properties in RESI\u2019s SFR portfolio; its ability to sell residential mortgage loans on favorable terms, or at all; the success of its loan resolution efforts; the ability of borrowers to refinance its loans with other lenders; its ability to sell modified loans on favorable terms; the availability of short-term and long-term financing on favorable terms; the length of time required to convert a distressed loan into a single-family rental property; conditions in the financial, real estate, housing and mortgage markets and the general economic conditions, as to which no assurance can be given. We cannot assure you that RESI will be able to make investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns or will not seek investments with greater risk to obtain the same level of returns or that the value of its investments in the future will not decline substantially. Existing and future government regulations may result in additional costs or delays, which could adversely affect the implementation of RESI's investment strategy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n(table of contents)\nRESI has leveraged its investments and expects to continue to do so, which may materially and adversely affect its return on investments and may reduce cash available for distribution to RESI's stockholders.\nTo the extent available, we intend to continue to leverage RESI's investments through borrowings, the level of which may vary based on the particular characteristics of RESI's investment portfolio and on market conditions. We have leveraged certain of RESI's investments to date through its repurchase agreements. When RESI enters into any repurchase agreement, it may sell securities, residential mortgage loans or residential properties to lenders (i.e., repurchase agreement counterparties) and receives cash from the lenders. The lenders are obligated to resell the same assets back to RESI at the end of the term of the transaction. Because the cash RESI receives from the lender when it initially sells the assets to the lender is less than the value of those assets, if the lender defaults on its obligation to resell the same assets back to RESI, it could incur a loss on the transaction. In addition, repurchase agreements generally allow the counterparties, to varying degrees, to determine a new market value of the collateral to reflect current market conditions or for other reasons. If such counterparty determines that the value of the collateral has decreased, it may initiate a margin call and require RESI to either post additional collateral to cover such decrease or repay a portion of the outstanding borrowing. Should this occur, in order to obtain cash to satisfy a margin call, RESI may be required to liquidate assets at a disadvantageous time, which could cause it to incur further losses. In the event RESI is unable to satisfy a margin call, its counterparty may sell the collateral, which may result in significant losses to RESI. RESI's repurchase agreements generally require it to comply with various financial covenants, including those relating to tangible net worth, profitability and its ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth, and to maintain minimum amounts of cash or cash equivalents sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position. We expect any future repurchase agreements or other financing arrangements will have similar provisions. In the event that RESI is unable to satisfy these requirements, it could be forced to sell additional investments at a loss which could materially and adversely affect RESI.\nRESI's repurchase agreements are complex and require a significant level of oversight by management. In part, this is due to the fact that the residential mortgage loan portfolios and single-family residential properties that will collateralize these repurchase agreements do not produce consistent cash flows and require specific activities to be performed at specific points in time in order to preserve value. RESI's inability to comply with the terms and conditions of these agreements could materially and adversely impact it. In addition, RESI's outstanding repurchase agreements contain, and we expect any future repurchase agreements will contain, events of default, including payment defaults, substantial margin calls, breaches of financial and other covenants and/or certain representations and warranties, cross-defaults, servicer termination events, guarantor defaults, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and other events of default customary for these types of agreements. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for these types of agreements and include the acceleration of the outstanding principal amount, requirements that RESI repurchase a portion or all of the collateral, the liquidation by the lender of the assets then subject to the agreements and the avoidance of other repurchase transactions with RESI. Because RESI's financing agreements will typically contain cross-default provisions, a default that occurs under any one agreement could allow the lenders under its other agreements to also declare a default. Any losses RESI incurs on its repurchase agreements could materially and adversely affect RESI.\nRESI has utilized repurchase agreements, seller financing arrangements, loan agreements and securitization transactions to finance its portfolio and may in the future utilize other sources of borrowings, including bank credit facilities, warehouse lines of credit and structured financing arrangements and term financing arrangements, among others, each of which may have similar risks to repurchase agreement financing and securitizations, including, but not limited to, covenant compliance, events of default, acceleration and margin calls. The percentage of leverage RESI employs, which could increase substantially in the future, varies depending on assets in its portfolios, its available capital, its ability to obtain and access financing arrangements with lenders and the lenders\u2019 and rating agencies\u2019 estimate of the stability of its investment portfolio\u2019s cash flow. There can be no assurance that new sources of financing will be available to RESI in the future or that existing sources of financing will continue to be available to it. RESI's governing documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt it may incur. RESI's return on investments and cash available for distribution to its stockholders may be reduced to the extent that changes in market conditions increase the cost of its financing relative to the income that can be derived from the investments acquired. RESI's debt service payments will reduce cash flow available for distribution to stockholders. RESI may not be able to meet its debt service obligations and, to the extent that it cannot, it risks the loss of some or all of its assets to foreclosure or sale to satisfy the obligations.\nIf these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n(table of contents)\nIf and when non-recourse long-term financing structures become available to RESI and are utilized, such structures expose it to risks which could result in losses to RESI.\nRESI currently utilizes securitization and other non-recourse long-term financing for certain of its investments and intends to continue to do so if, and to the extent, available. In such structures, RESI's lenders typically have only a claim against the assets collateralizing the debt rather than a general claim against RESI as an entity, subject to certain exceptions. Prior to any such financing, RESI may seek to finance its investments with relatively short-term facilities until a sufficient portfolio is accumulated. Conditions in the capital markets may make the issuance of any such long-term facility less attractive to RESI. While RESI typically retains the unrated equity component of securitizations and, therefore, still have exposure to any investments included in such securitizations, its inability to enter into such securitizations or similar arrangements in the future may increase its overall exposure to risks associated with direct ownership of such investments, including the risk of default.\nRESI's inability to refinance any short-term facilities would also increase its risk because borrowings thereunder would likely be recourse to it as an entity. If RESI is unable to obtain and/or renew short-term facilities or to consummate long-term facilities, it may be required to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\nRESI's inability to make interest payments on the seller financing obtained in connection with the HOME SFR Transaction and/or pay principal and interest would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with the HOME SFR Transaction, RESI's subsidiary that owns the properties, HOME SFR Borrower, LLC (\u201cHOME Borrower\u201d), borrowed approximately $489.3 million, representing 75% of the aggregate purchase price. This loan (the \u201cMSR Loan\u201d) is secured by the membership interests in HOME Borrower and the properties and other assets held by HOME Borrower. Upon the occurrence of a default of the payment of principal and/or interest of the MSR Loan, recourse may generally be had against the assets of HOME Borrower, including the interest rate cap agreement used to hedge the interest rate risk of the MSR Loan and the membership interests in HOME Borrower. The primary security and source of payment for the MSR Loan is the cash flows generated by the properties of HOME Borrower and the other collateral described in the underlying loan agreement (the \u201cMSR loan agreement\u201d). Since revenues from the properties held by HOME Borrower generally serve as the primary source for monthly payments due on the MSR Loan, if revenue from the properties is reduced or if expenses incurred in the operation of the properties increase, the ability of HOME Borrower to make payments with respect to the MSR Loan may be impaired. Similarly, the MSR loan agreement requires HOME Borrower to make a balloon payment at the ultimate maturity date of the MSR Loan. The ability of HOME Borrower to sell and/or refinance the properties and to make the payment on the maturity date or of HOME SFR Equity Owner, LLC (\u201cHOME Equity\u201d), an indirect subsidiary of RESI and the sole equity owner of HOME Borrower, to sell and/or refinance its equity interest in HOME Borrower to timely perform its guaranty obligations with respect to such maturity date payment, could be impaired by a decline in the value of the collateral properties. If HOME Borrower is unable to make payments under the MSR Loan or fails to make payment at maturity, the lender would be able to take possession/title to the membership interests of HOME Borrower and the properties and other assets of HOME Borrower to satisfy and discharge the MSR Loan obligations. In such an event, RESI's overall results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nEven though the MSR Loan is non-recourse to RESI and all of its subsidiaries other than HOME Equity and HOME Borrower, RESI has agreed to limited bad act indemnification obligations to the lender for the payment of (i) certain losses arising out of certain bad or wrongful acts of HOME Equity and HOME Borrower with respect to the MSR Loan and (ii) a portion of the principal amount of the MSR Loan and certain other obligations under the MSR loan agreement in the event RESI causes certain voluntary bankruptcy events of HOME Equity or HOME Borrower. Any of such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on RESI's results of operations and/or financial condition.\nRESI may incur significant costs in renovating its properties, and it may underestimate the costs or amount of time necessary to complete restorations.\nBefore renting a property, RESI's Property Managers perform a detailed assessment, with an on-site review of the property, to identify the scope of renovation to be completed. Beyond customary repairs, we may, on RESI's behalf, instruct the Property Managers to undertake improvements designed to optimize overall property appeal and increase the value of the property. We expect that nearly all of RESI's rental properties will require some level of renovation immediately upon their acquisition or in the future following expiration of a lease or otherwise. RESI may acquire properties that we plan to extensively renovate and restore. In addition, in order to reposition properties in the rental market, RESI will be required to make ongoing capital improvements and may need to perform significant renovations and repairs from time to time. Consequently, RESI is exposed to the risks inherent in property renovation, including potential cost overruns, increases in labor and materials costs, delays by\n(table of contents)\ncontractors in completing work, delays in the timing of receiving necessary work permits and certificates of occupancy and poor workmanship and improper oversight by its Property Managers. If our assumptions regarding the cost or timing of renovations across RESI's properties prove to be materially inaccurate, it may be more costly or take significantly more time than anticipated to develop and grow its single-family rental portfolio, which could materially and adversely affect RESI. This could, in turn, materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\nThe availability of portfolios of single-family residential properties for purchase on favorable terms may decline as market conditions change, our industry matures and/or additional purchasers for such portfolios emerge, and the prices for such portfolios may increase, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in supply of single-family residential property portfolios available for sale. Because RESI operates in an emerging industry, market conditions may be volatile, and the prices at which portfolios of single-family residential properties can be acquired may increase from time to time, or permanently, due to new market participants seeking such portfolios, a decrease in the supply of desirable portfolios or other adverse changes in the geographic areas that we may target from time to time. For these reasons, the supply of single-family residential properties that RESI may acquire may decline over time, which could materially and adversely affect RESI and its growth prospects.\nPortfolios of properties that RESI has acquired or may acquire may include properties that do not fit its investment criteria, and divestiture of such properties may be costly or time consuming or both, which may adversely affect its operating results.\nRESI acquired, and expects to continue to acquire, portfolios of single-family residential properties, many of which are, or will be, subject to existing leases. To the extent the management and leasing of such properties has not been consistent with its property management and leasing standards, RESI may be subject to a variety of risks, including risks relating to the condition of the properties, the credit quality and employment stability of the tenants and compliance with applicable laws, among others. In addition, financial and other information provided to RESI regarding such portfolios during our due diligence may be inaccurate, and RESI may not be able to obtain relief under contractual remedies, if any. If RESI concludes that certain properties acquired as part of a portfolio do not fit its investment criteria, it may decide to sell such properties and may be required to renovate the properties prior to sale, to hold the properties for an extended marketing period and/or sell the property at an unfavorable price, any of which could materially and adversely affect RESI.\nCompetition in identifying and acquiring residential rental assets could adversely affect RESI's ability to implement its business strategy, which could materially and adversely affect RESI.\nRESI faces competition from various sources for investment opportunities, including REITs, hedge funds, private equity funds, partnerships, developers and others. Some third-party competitors have substantially greater financial resources and access to capital than RESI does and may be able to accept more risk than RESI can. Competition from these companies may reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities available to RESI or increase the bargaining power of asset owners seeking to sell, which would increase the prices of assets. If such events occur, RESI's ability to implement its business strategy could be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect RESI. Given the existing competition, complexity of the market and requisite time needed to make such investments, no assurance can be given that RESI will be successful in acquiring investments that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Furthermore, there is no assurance that such investments, once acquired, will perform as expected. If these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n(table of contents)\nFailure of ASPS or MSR to effectively perform their obligations under their respective agreements with RESI could materially and adversely affect RESI.\nRESI has engaged ASPS and MSR to provide services. If for any reason RESI's Property Managers are unable to perform the services described under these agreements at the level and/or the cost anticipated or fail to allocate sufficient resources to meet RESI's needs for additional services under these agreements, qualified alternate service providers may not be readily available on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all, which would adversely affect RESI's performance. The performance of RESI's SFR portfolio will be affected by management decisions relating to the properties, which in turn may be affected by events or circumstances impacting its Property Managers or their respective affiliates, or the financial condition or results of operations of any of the foregoing. In certain circumstances and subject to the restrictions set forth in the property management agreements between each of RESI and its Property Managers, RESI's Property Managers have broad discretion with the respect to the management of the properties, including, without limitation, certain renovations, maintenance and certain matters related to leasing, including marketing and selection of tenants. RESI's Property Managers do not have long-term established track records to demonstrate their successful operation over a significant period of time. It is difficult to evaluate potential future performance of RESI's Property Managers and their ability to continue to perform management services effectively or within RESI's existing cost and expense assumptions without the benefit of such established track records.\nRESI's Property Managers' ability to perform their obligations under the respective property management services agreements will be affected by various factors, including, among other things, their ability to hire sufficient personnel and retain key personnel, the number of RESI's properties that they manage and the volume of properties under management for their other clients. Increases in the number of properties under management by RESI's Property Managers that RESI may purchase or that the Property Managers themselves manage away from RESI may require them to hire additional qualified personnel. No assurance can be made that either of the Property Managers will be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into their respective organizations and into the respective property management structures for RESI's acquired properties. Moreover, as the size of RESI's Property Managers' respective property management portfolios increases, the resources dedicated to RESI could decrease or require its Property Managers' personnel to focus on clients other than RESI. Such a decrease in productivity may adversely affect the management of RESI's properties.\nRESI's Property Managers' failure to perform the services under their respective property management agreements or RESI's inability to retain qualified alternate service providers to replace and/or supplement them could result in a material adverse effect on RESI.\nMSR has a limited operating history, and RESI has previously had no experience with MSR. The failure of MSR to adequately perform its obligations to RESI or the failure of MSR to provide RESI with data and reports for its required reporting would have a material adverse effect on RESI's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMSR, who RESI has retained to perform property management services with respect to the properties acquired in the HOME SFR Transaction, was formed in April 2012. As of the date of the HOME SFR Transaction, MSR provided property management services, including acquisition, renovation, leasing and property management, repair and maintenance and other services with respect to a portfolio of approximately 10,000 single-family rental homes, including the acquired properties. Given MSR\u2019s limited operating history and our limited experience working with MSR on RESI's behalf, there is no assurance that MSR will be able to adequately perform its property management obligations, including reporting requirements under the MSR loan agreement, for RESI.\nThe day-to-day property management of the properties acquired in the HOME SFR Transaction, including leasing and collection functions, is and will be performed by MSR. Under the terms of the property management agreement with MSR, MSR will be required to participate in regular calls with our representatives, on RESI's behalf, to review its practices and provide updates regarding the performance of the acquired properties, and we, on RESI's behalf, will also have approval rights over certain capital expenditures and renovation expenditures. The practices and procedures of MSR may differ from what we would determine, on RESI's behalf, on our own or the practices and procedures of ASPS and may require a longer integration period to operate with the efficiencies we target for RESI. Consequently, performance of the properties that MSR manages may vary from the performance of the other properties in RESI's portfolio managed by ASPS.\nIn certain circumstances, the MSR loan agreement and the property management agreement with MSR permit RESI to appoint another management company satisfying certain eligibility criteria as a replacement property manager in certain circumstances, including, without limitation, if MSR fails to perform and/or fails to make timely any reports to RESI that HOME Borrower is required to make under the MSR loan agreement. In addition, the lender under the MSR loan agreement may, under certain circumstances, cause RESI to replace MSR. HOME Borrower\u2019s right to terminate MSR includes termination events tied to the\n(table of contents)\nperformance of the properties, such as vacancy rates, retention rates, delinquency rates and rent rates. There is a high risk of a disruption in operations and possible lapse in quality should the acquired properties experience a change in operators or key leadership personnel, particularly in the transition period immediately following such changes. There is no assurance that one or more adequate replacement property managers capable of managing this portfolio of single-family rental properties would be available and willing to assume MSR\u2019s duties upon terms (including the compensation) that are the same or more favorable than those set forth in the property management agreement between HOME Borrower and MSR. Even if one or more replacement property managers were engaged, there is no assurance that such replacement managers individually or collectively would be able to perform management services adequately or within existing cost and expense assumptions.\nIf any of these foregoing risks materialize, this would have a material adverse effect on the performance of these properties or could cause a default of RESI's obligations under the MSR loan agreement, and RESI's business, results of operations and financial condition would therefore be materially harmed.\nRESI may be materially and adversely affected by risks affecting the single-family rental properties in which its investments may be concentrated at any given time, as well as from unfavorable changes in the related geographic regions.\nRESI's assets are not subject to any geographic diversification requirements or concentration limitations, and, as a result, circumstances or events that impact a geographic region in which RESI has a significant concentration of properties, including a downturn in regional economic conditions or natural disasters, could materially and adversely affect RESI. Entities that sell residential rental portfolios may group the portfolios by location or other metrics that could result in a concentration of RESI's portfolio by geography, single-family rental property characteristics and/or borrower or tenant demographics. Such concentration could increase the risk of loss to RESI if the particular concentration in its portfolio is subject to greater risks or undergoing adverse developments. In addition, adverse conditions in the areas where the properties or borrowers are located (including business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, oversupply, reduced demand and other factors) may have an adverse effect on the value of its investments. A material decline in the demand for single-family housing or rentals in the areas where RESI owns assets may materially and adversely affect RESI. Lack of diversification can increase the correlation of non-performance and foreclosure risks among RESI's investments. If these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nShort-term leases of residential property expose RESI more quickly to the effects of declining market rents.\nWe anticipate that a majority of RESI's leases to tenants of SFR properties will be for a term of one to two years. As these leases permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, we anticipate RESI's rental revenues will be affected by declines in market rents more quickly than if its leases were for longer terms. Short-term leases may result in high turnover, resulting in additional cost to renovate and maintain the property and lower occupancy levels. Because RESI has a limited operating history, its tenant turnover rate and related cost estimates may be less accurate than if we had more operating data upon which to base these estimates.\nRESI may be unable to secure funds for future tenant or other capital improvements, which could limit its ability to attract or replace tenants.\nWhen RESI acquires or otherwise takes title to single-family properties or when tenants fail to renew their leases or otherwise vacate their space, RESI generally will be required to expend funds for property restoration and leasing commissions in order to lease the property. If RESI has not established reserves or set aside sufficient funds for such expenditures, it may have to obtain financing from other sources, as to which no assurance can be given. RESI may also have future financing needs for other capital improvements to restore its properties. If RESI needs to secure financing for capital improvements in the future but are unable to secure such financing on favorable terms or at all, RESI may be unable or unwilling to make capital improvements or it may be required or may choose to defer such improvements. If this happens, RESI's properties may suffer from a greater risk of obsolescence or decreased marketability, a decline in value or decreased cash flow as a result of fewer potential tenants being attracted to the property or existing tenants not renewing their leases. If RESI does not have access to sufficient funding in the future, it may not be able to make necessary capital improvements to its properties, and its properties\u2019 ability to generate revenue may be significantly impaired. If these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n(table of contents)\nRESI's revenue and expenses are not directly correlated, and, because a large percentage of its costs and expenses are fixed and some variable expenses may not decrease over time, it may not be able to adapt its cost structure to offset any declines in its revenue.\nMany of the expenses associated with RESI's business, such as acquisition costs, restoration and maintenance costs, HOA fees, personal and real property taxes, insurance, compensation and other general expenses are fixed and would not necessarily decrease proportionally with any decrease in revenue. RESI's assets also will likely require a significant amount of ongoing capital expenditure. RESI's expenses, including capital expenditures, will be affected by, among other things, any inflationary increases, and cost increases may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. Certain expenses, such as HOA fees, taxes, insurance and maintenance costs are recurring in nature and may not decrease on a per-unit basis as RESI's portfolio grows through additional property acquisitions. By contrast, RESI's revenue is affected by many factors beyond our control, such as the availability and price of alternative rental housing and economic conditions in its markets. As a result, RESI may not be able to fully, or even partially, offset any increase in its expenses with a corresponding increase in its revenues. In addition, state and local regulations may require RESI to maintain its properties, even if the cost of maintenance is greater than the potential benefit. If these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition could limit RESI's ability to lease single-family rental properties or increase or maintain rents.\nRESI's SFR properties, when acquired, will compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents, including rental apartments, condominiums and other single-family homes available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. RESI's competitors\u2019 single-family rental properties may be better quality, in a more desirable location or have leasing terms more favorable than RESI can provide. In addition, RESI's ability to compete and generate favorable returns depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, the financial condition and liquidity of current and prospective renters, availability and cost of capital, taxes and governmental regulations. Given RESI's significant competition, we cannot assure you that it will be successful in acquiring or managing SFR properties that generate favorable returns, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\nIf rents in RESI's markets do not increase sufficiently to keep pace with rising costs of operations, its operating results and cash available for distribution will decline.\nThe success of RESI's business model will substantially depend on conditions in the SFR property market in its geographic markets. RESI's asset acquisitions are premised on assumptions about, among other things, occupancy and rent levels. If those assumptions prove to be inaccurate, RESI's operating results and cash available for distribution will be lower than expected, potentially materially. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees. Rental rates and occupancy levels have benefited in recent periods from macroeconomic trends affecting the U.S. economy and residential real estate and mortgage markets in particular, including the following:\n\u2022\na tightening of credit that has made it more difficult to finance a home purchase, combined with efforts by consumers generally to reduce their exposure to credit;\n\u2022\neconomic and employment conditions that have increased foreclosure rates; and\n\u2022\nreduced real estate values that challenged the traditional notion that homeownership is a stable investment.\nIf the current trend favoring renting rather than homeownership reverses, the single-family rental market could decline.\nThe single-family rental market is currently significantly larger than in historical periods. We do not expect the favorable trends in the single-family rental market to continue indefinitely. Eventually, a strengthening of the U.S. economy and job growth, together with the large supply of foreclosed single-family residential properties, the current availability of low residential mortgage rates and government sponsored programs promoting home ownership, may contribute to a stabilization or reversal of the current trend that favors renting rather than homeownership. In addition, we expect that as investors increasingly seek to capitalize on opportunities to purchase undervalued housing properties and convert them to productive uses, the supply of SFR properties will decrease and the competition for tenants will intensify. A softening of the rental property market in RESI's markets would adversely affect its operating results and cash available for distribution, potentially materially. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\n(table of contents)\nPoor tenant selection and defaults by RESI's tenants may materially and adversely affect RESI.\nRESI's success will depend, in large part, upon its ability to attract and retain qualified tenants for its properties. This will depend, in turn, upon RESI's ability to screen applicants, identify good tenants and avoid tenants who may default. RESI will inevitably make mistakes in its selection of tenants, and it may rent to tenants whose default on its leases or failure to comply with the terms of the lease or HOA regulations could materially and adversely affect RESI. For example, tenants may default on payment of rent; make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements; make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities; make use of RESI's properties for illegal purposes; damage or make unauthorized structural changes to its properties that may not be fully covered by security deposits; refuse to leave the property when the lease is terminated; engage in domestic violence or similar disturbances; disturb nearby residents with noise, trash, odors or eyesores; fail to comply with HOA regulations; sub-let to less desirable individuals in violation of RESI's leases or permit unauthorized persons to live with them. The process of evicting a defaulting tenant from a family residence can be adversarial, protracted and costly. Furthermore, some tenants facing eviction may damage or destroy the property. Damage to RESI's properties may significantly delay re-leasing after eviction, necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental revenue or value of the property. In addition, RESI will incur turnover costs associated with re-leasing the properties, such as marketing expenses and brokerage commissions, and will not collect revenue while the property is vacant. Although RESI will attempt to work with tenants to prevent such damage or destruction, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in all or most cases. Such tenants will not only cause RESI not to achieve its financial objectives for the properties in which they live, but may subject RESI to liability, and may damage RESI's reputation with its other tenants and in the communities where it does business. If these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on RESI.\nRESI carries commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to its single-family rental properties on terms we consider commercially reasonable. However, many of the policies covering casualty losses are subject to substantial deductibles and exclusions, and RESI will be self-insured up to the amount of the deductibles and exclusions. For example, RESI may not always be fully insured against losses arising from floods, windstorms, fires, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism or civil unrest because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it economically impractical. If an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur, RESI could lose its capital invested in a property or group of properties as well as the anticipated future revenues from affected SFR properties or groups of properties. Further, inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also prevent RESI from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a property after it has been damaged or destroyed.\nIn the event that RESI incurs a casualty loss that is not fully covered by insurance, the value of its assets will be reduced by the amount of any such uninsured loss, and RESI could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property. Further, if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur, RESI would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party. A significant uninsured property or liability loss could adversely affect RESI's financial condition, operating results, cash flows and ability to make distributions on its common stock.\nA significant number of RESI's single-family rental properties may be part of homeowners\u2019 associations. RESI and its renters will be subject to the rules and regulations of such homeowners\u2019 associations which may be arbitrary or restrictive and violations of such rules may subject us to additional fees and penalties and litigation which may be costly.\nA significant number of RESI's single-family residential properties, when acquired, may be subject to HOAs which are private entities that regulate the activities of and levy assessments on properties in a residential subdivision. Some of the HOAs that will govern RESI's single-family residential properties may enact onerous or arbitrary rules that restrict RESI's ability to renovate, market or lease its SFR properties or require it to renovate or maintain such properties at standards or costs that are in excess of our planned operating budgets. Such rules may include requirements for landscaping, limitations on signage promoting a property for lease or sale or the use of specific construction materials to be used in renovations. Some HOAs also impose limits on the number of property owners who may rent their homes which, if met or exceeded, may cause RESI to incur additional costs to sell the affected property and opportunity costs of lost rental income. Furthermore, many HOAs impose restrictions on the conduct of occupants of homes and the use of common areas, and RESI may have renters who violate these HOA rules for which RESI may be liable as the property owner. Additionally, the boards of directors of the HOAs that will govern its single-family residential properties may not make important disclosures or may block RESI's access to HOA records, initiate litigation, restrict its ability to sell, impose assessments or arbitrarily change the HOA rules. RESI may be unaware of or unable to review or comply with certain HOA rules before acquiring a single-family residential property, and any such\n(table of contents)\nexcessively restrictive or arbitrary regulations may cause RESI to sell such property, if possible, prevent it from renting such property or otherwise reduce its cash flow from such property. Any of the above-described occurrences may materially and adversely affect RESI\u2019s and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on information supplied by prospective tenants in managing RESI's business.\nWe rely on information supplied to us by prospective tenants in their rental applications as part of our due diligence process to make leasing decisions, and we cannot be certain that this information is accurate. In particular, we rely on information submitted by prospective tenants regarding household income, tenure at current job, number of children and size of household. Moreover, these applications are submitted to us at the time we evaluate a prospective tenant, and we do not require tenants to provide us with updated information during the terms of their leases, notwithstanding the fact that this information can, and frequently does, change over time. Even though this information is not updated, we will use it to evaluate the overall average credit characteristics of RESI's portfolio over time. If tenant-supplied information is inaccurate or RESI's tenants\u2019 creditworthiness declines over time, we may make poor leasing decisions and RESI's portfolio may contain more credit risk than we believe exists, which could harm RESI\u2019s and our results of operations and financial condition.\nDifficulties in selling REO properties and/or non-performing and re-performing mortgage loans could limit RESI's flexibility and/or harm its liquidity.\nFederal tax laws may limit RESI's ability to earn a gain on the sale of its properties if it is found to have held or acquired the properties with the intent to resell, and this limitation may adversely affect its willingness to sell REO properties or mortgage loans under favorable conditions or if necessary for funding purposes. RESI typically contributes REO properties that will not meet its rental profile to its taxable REIT subsidiary in order to sell and generate gains or losses at the taxable REIT subsidiary upon such sales. In addition, RESI's REO properties that it intends to sell may at times be difficult to dispose of quickly or at favorable prices. These potential difficulties in selling real estate in RESI's markets may limit its ability to either sell properties that it deems unsuitable for rental or change or reduce the REO properties in its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. RESI's failure to sell or delays in selling its REO properties could potentially cause a strain on its liquidity, and it may be forced to reduce prices and/or continue to hold such REO properties without leverage, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\nThe growth of RESI's SFR portfolio, at least in the short term, is expected to be dependent on its ability to sell portfolios of our non-performing and re-performing mortgage loans and non-rental REO properties. If RESI is unable to sell these assets at optimal prices or on a timely basis, or if the market shifts, creating lower sales prices, RESI's ability to utilize the equity embedded in these assets would be harmed, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to convert the proceeds of such sales into buying power for the acquisition of SFR properties. Furthermore, a large portion of the sale proceeds of such non-performing mortgage loans and non-rental REOs are utilized to purchase the assets off of RESI's repurchase facilities for which the assets are collateral. If a higher than expected portion of the loan sale consideration must be utilized to repurchase assets off of its facilities, RESI's ability to purchase SFR properties may also be adversely affected, which would slow the growth of its rental portfolio.\nMany of RESI's assets may be illiquid, and this lack of liquidity could significantly impede its ability to vary its portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions or to realize the value at which such assets are carried if it is required to dispose of them.\nThe distressed residential mortgage loans and the REO properties that RESI has acquired are relatively illiquid in that there are a limited number of qualified or interested parties to acquire the portfolios held for sale. Illiquidity may result from the absence of an established market for the distressed residential mortgage loans or REO properties, as well as legal or contractual restrictions on their resale, refinancing or other disposition. Such restrictions would interfere with subsequent sales of such loans or REO properties or adversely affect the terms that could be obtained upon any disposition thereof. RESI has recently completed multiple sales of mortgage loan portfolios to unaffiliated third parties as a way to raise additional capital for SFR property acquisitions and will continue to evaluate the opportunistic sale of additional portfolios in the future. The timing and extent of its success in selling such assets on acceptable terms or at all cannot be predicted due to their illiquid nature. RESI's inability to sell portfolios of residential mortgage loans or REO properties on acceptable terms and/or in accordance with its anticipated timing could potentially cause a strain on its liquidity, which could materially and adversely affect RESI's financial condition.\n(table of contents)\nResidential mortgage loan modification and refinance programs, future legislative action and other actions and changes may materially and adversely affect the supply of, value of and the returns on sub-performing and non-performing loans.\nRESI's business model partially had been dependent on the success of loan resolution efforts and the conversion of a significant portion of those loans to SFR properties. For non-performing mortgage loans, lenders may choose to delay foreclosure proceedings, renegotiate interest rates or refinance loans for borrowers who face foreclosure. Further, in recent years, the federal government has instituted a number of programs aimed at assisting at-risk homeowners and reducing the number of properties going into foreclosure or going into non-performing status.\nFor example, the U.S. Government, through the Federal Reserve, the Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) has implemented a number of federal programs designed to assist homeowners, including (i) the Home Affordable Modification Program (\u201cHAMP\u201d), which provides homeowners with assistance in avoiding defaults on residential mortgage loans, (ii) the Hope for Homeowners Program (the \u201cH4H Program\u201d), which allows certain distressed borrowers to refinance their residential mortgage loans into FHA-insured loans in order to avoid residential mortgage loan foreclosures and (iii) the Home Affordable Refinance Program (the \u201cHARP Program\u201d), which allows borrowers who are current on their mortgage payments to refinance and reduce their monthly mortgage payments without new mortgage insurance, up to an unlimited loan-to-value ratio for fixed-rate mortgages. HAMP, the H4H Program, the HARP Program and other loss mitigation programs may involve, among other things, the modification of residential mortgage loans to reduce the principal amount of the loans (through forbearance and/or forgiveness) and/or the rate of interest payable on the loans and/or to extend the payment terms of the loans. These loan modification programs, future legislative or regulatory actions including possible amendments to the bankruptcy laws that result in the modification of outstanding residential mortgage loans as well as changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing residential mortgage loans, may materially and adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, RESI's portfolio of sub-performing and non-performing loans, as well as the REO properties and rental homes in its portfolio that had been acquired through the loan resolution process. Many of the loan servicers and their vendors have become the targets of regulatory or other investigations that potentially could relate to certain of the loans that had been owned by RESI or predecessor investors.\nOther governmental actions may affect RESI's business by hindering the pace of foreclosures. In recent periods, there has been a backlog of foreclosures, due to a combination of volume constraints and legal actions, including those brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), State Attorneys General, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d) and the Federal Reserve Board against mortgage servicers alleging wrongful foreclosure practices. Financial institutions have also been subjected to regulatory restrictions and limitations on foreclosure activity by the FDIC. Legal claims brought or threatened by the DOJ, HUD and certain State Attorneys General against residential mortgage servicers and an enforcement action threatened by the OCC against residential mortgage servicers have both produced large settlements. A portion of the funds from each settlement will be directed to homeowners seeking to avoid foreclosure through mortgage modifications, and servicers are required to adopt specified measures to reduce mortgage obligations in certain situations. It is expected that the settlements will help many homeowners avoid foreclosures that would otherwise have occurred in the near-term. It is also possible that other residential mortgage servicers will agree to similar settlements. These developments will reduce the number of homes in the process of foreclosure and decrease the supply of properties that meet RESI's investment criteria.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress and numerous state legislatures have considered, proposed or adopted legislation to constrain foreclosures or may do so in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d), which supervises and enforces federal consumer protection laws as they apply to banks, credit unions and other financial companies, including mortgage servicers. It remains uncertain as to whether any of these CFPB or other related\nmeasures will have a significant impact on foreclosure volumes or what the timing or extent of that impact would be. Also, the number of families seeking rental housing might be reduced by such legislation, reducing rental housing demand for properties in RESI's markets.\nRESI may be, or may become, subject to the regulation of various states, including licensing requirements and consumer protection statutes. RESI's failure to comply with any such laws, if applicable to it, would adversely affect its ability to implement its business strategy, which could materially and adversely affect RESI. If these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees would be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n(table of contents)\nCertain jurisdictions require licenses to purchase, hold, enforce or sell residential mortgage loans. In the event that any such licensing requirement is applicable to RESI and RESI is not able to obtain such licenses in a timely manner or at all, its ability to implement its business strategy could be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect RESI.\nCertain jurisdictions require a license to purchase, hold, enforce or sell residential mortgage loans. RESI has owned its loans in Delaware statutory trusts with a nationally-chartered bank as the trustee. Therefore, it has not held hold any such licenses. Because RESI has contributed its acquired residential mortgage loans to wholly-owned trusts whose trustee is a nationally-chartered bank, it may be exempt from state licensing requirements. However, there is no assurance that RESI will not be determined to have been required to obtain such licenses. If these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nFair values of RESI's mortgage loans may not be precise and may materially and adversely affect its operating results and credit availability, which, in turn, would materially and adversely affect RESI.\nThe values of RESI's mortgage loans may not be precisely determinable. We measure the fair value of RESI's mortgage loans monthly, but the fair value at which RESI's mortgage loans are recorded may not be an indication of their realizable value. Ultimate realization of the value of a mortgage loan depends to a great extent on economic and other conditions that are beyond our control. Further, our fair value determination is only an estimate based on a number of factors incorporated into our mortgage loan valuation model and requires judgment of the price at which a mortgage loan can be sold since market prices of mortgage loans can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. In certain cases, our assessment of the fair value of RESI's mortgage loans includes inputs provided by third-party dealers and pricing services, and valuations of certain securities or other assets in which we invest are often difficult to obtain and are subject to judgments that may vary among market participants. Changes in the estimated fair values of RESI's mortgage loans are directly charged or credited to earnings for the period. If RESI were to liquidate a particular mortgage loan, the realized value may be more than or less than the amount at which such mortgage loan was recorded. We could be materially and adversely affected by negative determinations that reduce the fair value of RESI's mortgage loans, and such valuations may fluctuate over short periods of time.\nWe value the properties underlying RESI's mortgage loans and recognize unrealized gains in each period when RESI's mortgage loans are transferred to real estate owned. The fair value of residential properties is estimated using broker price opinions (\u201cBPOs\u201d) provided by third-party brokers. BPOs are subject to the judgments of the particular broker formed by visiting the property, assessing general home values in the area, reviewing comparable listings and reviewing comparable completed sales. These judgments may vary among brokers and may fluctuate over time based on housing market activities and the influx of additional comparable listings and sales. RESI's results could be materially and adversely affected if the judgments used by the brokers prove to be incorrect or inaccurate.\nIf these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nChallenges to the MERS\u00ae System could materially and adversely affect RESI.\nMERSCORP, Inc. is a privately held company that maintains an electronic registry, referred to as the MERS System, which tracks servicing rights and ownership of loans in the United States. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\u201cMERS\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of MERSCORP, Inc., can serve as a nominee for the owner of a residential mortgage loan and in that role initiate foreclosures and/or become the mortgagee of record for the loan in local land records. We may choose to use MERS as a nominee. The MERS System is widely used by participants in the mortgage finance industry. Several legal challenges have been made disputing MERS\u2019 legal standing to initiate foreclosures and/or act as nominee in local land records. These challenges could negatively affect MERS\u2019 ability to serve as the mortgagee of record in some jurisdictions. In addition, where MERS is the mortgagee of record, it must execute assignments of mortgages, affidavits and other legal documents in connection with foreclosure proceedings. As a result, investigations by governmental authorities and others into the servicer foreclosure process deficiencies described with respect to \u201cRESI's inability to promptly foreclose upon defaulted residential mortgage loans could increase its cost of doing business and/or diminish its expected return on investments\u201d may impact MERS. Failures by MERS to apply prudent and effective process controls and to comply with legal and other requirements in the foreclosure process could pose operational, reputational and legal risks that may materially and adversely affect RESI, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n(table of contents)\nWe utilize analytical models and data in connection with the valuation of RESI's investments, and any incorrect, misleading or incomplete information used in connection therewith would subject RESI to potential risks.\nGiven the complexity of RESI's investments and strategies, we must rely heavily on models and data, including analytical models (both proprietary models developed by us and those supplied by third parties) and information and data supplied by third parties. Models and data are used to value RESI's assets or potential investments and also in connection with performing due diligence on RESI's investments. In the event models and data prove to be incorrect, misleading or incomplete, any decisions made in reliance thereon expose us to potential risks. For example, by relying on incorrect models and data, especially valuation models, RESI may be induced to buy certain investments at prices that are too high, to sell certain other investments at prices that are too low or to miss favorable opportunities altogether, all of which could adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\nChanges in global economic and capital market conditions, including periods of generally deteriorating occupancy and real estate industry fundamentals may materially and adversely affect RESI.\nThere are risks to the ownership of real estate and real estate related assets, including decreases in residential property values, changes in global, national, regional or local economic, demographic and real estate market conditions as well as other factors particular to the locations of RESI's investments. A prolonged recession and a slow recovery could materially and adversely affect RESI as a result of, among other items, the following:\n\u2022\njoblessness or unemployment rates that adversely affect the local economy;\n\u2022\nan oversupply of or a reduced demand for SFR properties for rent;\n\u2022\na decline in employment or lack of employment growth;\n\u2022\nthe inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases or fulfill their lease obligations;\n\u2022\na decline in rental rate, which may be accentuated since we expect RESI to generally have rent terms of one to two years;\n\u2022\nrent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing that could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and availability and terms of debt financing; and\n\u2022\neconomic conditions that could cause an increase in RESI's operating expenses such as increases in property taxes, utilities and routine maintenance.\nThese conditions could also adversely impact the financial condition and liquidity of the renters that will occupy RESI's real estate properties and, as a result, their ability to pay rent to RESI.\nInflation or deflation may adversely affect RESI's results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased inflation could have an adverse impact on interest rates, property management expenses and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than RESI's rental and other revenue. Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of income without an accompanying reduction in RESI's expenses. Accordingly, inflation or deflation may adversely affect RESI's results of operations and cash flows, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\nChanges in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable law could materially and adversely affect RESI.\nAs an owner of real estate, RESI is required to comply with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations. These laws and regulations may include zoning laws, building codes, landlord-tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to RESI's business operations. Noncompliance with laws or regulations could expose RESI to liability.\nLower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from RESI's need to comply with changes in (i) laws imposing remediation requirements and potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlord-tenant laws or (iii) other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the rehabilitation, use and operation of RESI's SFR properties, including changes to building codes and fire and life-safety codes. If these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n(table of contents)\nSingle-family residential properties that are subject to foreclosure or short-sales are subject to risks of theft, vandalism or other damage that could impair their value.\nWhen a single-family residential property is subject to foreclosure, it is possible that the homeowner may cease to maintain the property adequately or that the property may be abandoned by the homeowner and become susceptible to theft or vandalism. Lack of maintenance, theft and vandalism can substantially impair the value of the property. To the extent RESI initiates foreclosure proceedings, some of its properties could be impaired.\nContingent or unknown liabilities could materially and adversely affect RESI.\nRESI's acquisition activities are subject to many risks. RESI may acquire properties that are subject to unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for or with respect to liens attached to properties, unpaid real estate taxes, utilities or HOA charges for which a prior owner remains liable, clean-up or remediation of environmental conditions or code violations, claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired properties and tax liabilities, among other things. In each case, RESI's acquisition may be without any, or with only limited, recourse with respect to unknown or contingent liabilities or conditions. As a result, if any such liability were to arise relating to RESI's properties, or if any adverse condition exists with respect to RESI's properties that is in excess of its insurance coverage, RESI might have to pay substantial sums to settle or cure it, which could materially and adversely affect RESI. The properties RESI acquires may also be subject to covenants, conditions or restrictions that restrict the use or ownership of such properties, including prohibitions on leasing or requirements to obtain the approval of HOAs prior to leasing. We may not discover such restrictions during the acquisition process and such restrictions may adversely affect RESI's ability to operate such properties as it intends. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\nThe costs and amount of time necessary to secure possession and control of a newly acquired property may exceed our assumptions, which would delay RESI's receipt of revenue from, and return on, the property.\nUpon acquiring a property, RESI may have to evict occupants who are in unlawful possession before it can secure possession and control of the property. The holdover occupants may be the former owners or tenants of a property, or they may be squatters or others who are illegally in possession. Securing control and possession from these occupants can be both costly and time-consuming. If these costs and delays exceed our expectations, RESI's and our financial performance may suffer because of the increased expenses incurred or the unexpected delays in turning the properties into revenue-producing rental properties.\nEminent domain could lead to material losses on RESI's investments.\nIt is possible that governmental authorities may exercise eminent domain to acquire land on which RESI's properties are built in order to build roads or other infrastructure. Any such exercise of eminent domain would allow RESI to recover only the fair value of the affected properties, which we believe may be interpreted to be substantially less than the actual value of the property. Several cities are also exploring proposals to use eminent domain to acquire residential loans to assist borrowers to remain in their homes, potentially reducing the supply of single-family properties for sale in RESI's markets. Any of these events can cause a material loss to RESI, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\nRESI likely will incur costs due to litigation, including but not limited to, class actions, tenant rights claims and consumer demands.\nThere are numerous tenants\u2019 rights and consumer rights organizations throughout the country. As RESI grows in scale, it may attract attention from some of these organizations and become a target of legal demands or litigation. Many such consumer organizations have become more active and better funded in connection with mortgage foreclosure-related issues and displaced home ownership. Some of these organizations may shift their litigation, lobbying, fundraising and grass roots organizing activities to focus on landlord-tenant issues as more entities engage in the single-family rental property market. Additional actions that may be targeted at RESI include eviction proceedings and other landlord-tenant disputes, challenges to title and ownership rights (including actions brought by prior owners alleging wrongful foreclosure by their lender or servicer) and issues with local housing officials arising from the condition or maintenance of a single-family rental property. While we intend to conduct RESI's rental business lawfully and in compliance with applicable landlord-tenant and consumer laws, such organizations might work in conjunction with trial and pro bono lawyers in one state or multiple states to attempt to bring claims against RESI on a class action basis for damages or injunctive relief. We cannot anticipate what form such legal actions might take or what remedies they may seek. Any of such claims may result in a finding of liability that may materially and adversely affect RESI.\n(table of contents)\nAdditionally, these organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against RESI or may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain RESI's business operations. If they are successful in any such endeavors, they could directly limit and constrain RESI's business operations and impose on RESI significant litigation expenses, including settlements to avoid continued litigation or judgments for damages or injunctions. Any of the above-described occurrences may materially and adversely affect RESI, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise RESI's and/or our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of RESI's and our business, we, through ASPS, MSR or RESI's mortgage servicers, may acquire and store sensitive data on our network, such as our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of RESI's prospective and current tenants. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be subject to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation, which could materially and adversely affect RESI and/or us.\nRESI may incur substantial costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental and public health laws, regulations and ordinances, RESI may be required, regardless of knowledge or responsibility, to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at its single-family residential properties (including in some cases, asbestos-containing construction materials, lead-based paints, contaminants migrating from off-site sources and natural substances such as methane, mold and radon gas) and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property, personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination. These damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage RESI may have for such events, which could materially and adversely affect RESI. The presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect RESI's ability to borrow against, sell or rent the affected property. In addition, some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination, which may also adversely affect RESI's ability to borrow against, sell or rent the affected property. If these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRESI properties will be subject to property and other taxes that may increase over time.\nRESI will be responsible for property taxes for its single-family residential properties when acquired, which may increase as tax rates change and properties are reassessed by taxing authorities. If RESI fails to pay any such taxes, the applicable taxing authorities may place a lien on the property and the property may be subject to a tax sale. Increases in property taxes would also adversely affect RESI's yield from rental properties. Any such occurrence may materially and adversely affect RESI which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect us.\nIf RESI is deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, it would have significant adverse consequences to RESI and us.\nRESI does not intend or expect to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), since it will not engage primarily or hold itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, RESI will be primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring real estate and mortgages on real estate, specifically single-family rental assets. To the extent that the SEC determines that RESI is in fact an investment company, RESI intends to rely on the exception from the Investment Company Act set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which excludes from the definition of investment company \u201cany person who is not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and who is primarily engaged in one or more of the following businesses: . . .(C) purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.\u201d The SEC generally requires that for the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to be available, at least 55% of an entity's be comprised of mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, also known as \u201cqualifying interests,\u201d and at least another 25% of the entity\u2019s assets must be comprised of\n(table of contents)\nadditional qualifying interests or real estate-type interests (with no more than 20% of the entity\u2019s assets comprised of miscellaneous assets). Any significant acquisition by RESI of non-real estate assets without the acquisition of substantial real estate assets could cause RESI to meet the definitions of an \u201cinvestment company.\u201d If RESI is deemed to be an investment company, RESI may be required to register as an investment company if it is unable to dispose of the disqualifying assets, which could have a material adverse effect on RESI.\nRegistration under the Investment Company Act would require RESI to comply with a variety of substantive requirements that impose, among other things:\n\u2022\nlimitations on capital structure;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on specified investments;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on leverage or senior securities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on unsecured borrowings;\n\u2022\nprohibitions on transactions with affiliates and\n\u2022\ncompliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly increase RESI's operating expenses.\nIf RESI were required to register as an investment company but failed to do so, it would be prohibited from engaging in its business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against it.\nRegistration with the SEC as an investment company would be costly, would subject RESI to a host of complex regulations and would divert attention from the conduct of RESI's business. In addition, if RESI purchases or sells any real estate assets to avoid becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act, it could materially adversely affect its net asset value, the amount of funds available for investment and its ability to pay distributions to its stockholders. Any such occurrences would adversely impact our income from the management fees paid by RESI.\nRisks Related to RESI's Qualification as a REIT\nRESI\u2019s failure to qualify as a REIT would materially and adversely affect RESI and us.\nRESI made an election to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 2013. However, we cannot assure you that RESI will remain qualified as a REIT. Moreover, RESI's qualification and taxation as a REIT will depend upon its ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual operating results, certain qualification tests set forth in the federal income tax laws. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that RESI's actual results of operations for any particular taxable year will satisfy such requirements. If RESI fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to its stockholders because:\n\u2022\nRESI would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income;\n\u2022\nRESI could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax to a greater extent and possibly increased state and local taxes; and\n\u2022\nUnless RESI is entitled to relief under certain federal income tax laws, it could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which it failed to qualify as a REIT. In addition, if RESI fails to qualify as a REIT, it will no longer be required to make distributions.\nAs a result of all these factors, RESI's failure to qualify as a REIT could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital, and it could materially and adversely affect RESI and the market price of its common stock. If these risks are realized by RESI, our ability to generate management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRESI's tax position with respect to the accrual of interest and market discount income with respect to distressed mortgage loans involves risk.\nRESI does not accrue interest income or market discount on defaulted or delinquent loans when certain criteria are satisfied. The criteria generally relate to whether those amounts are uncollectible or of doubtful collectability. If the Internal Revenue Service were to challenge this position successfully, RESI could be subject to entity level excise tax as a result of \u201cdeficiency dividends\u201d that it may be required to pay to its stockholders at the time of such an adjustment to its income in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\n(table of contents)\nCompliance with REIT requirements may cause RESI to forego otherwise attractive opportunities which may hinder or delay its ability to meet its investment objectives and reduce your overall return.\nTo qualify as a REIT, RESI is required at all times to satisfy certain tests relating to, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of its assets, its financing, hedging and investment strategies, the ownership of its stock and amounts it distributes to its stockholders. Compliance with the REIT requirements may preclude RESI from certain financing or hedging strategies or cause it to forego otherwise attractive opportunities which may hinder or delay its ability to meet its investment objectives and reduce your overall return. For example, RESI may be required to pay distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when it does not have funds readily available for distribution.\nCompliance with REIT requirements may force RESI to liquidate otherwise attractive investments, which could materially adversely affect RESI.\nTo qualify as a REIT, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of RESI's assets must consist of qualified real estate assets, cash, cash items and government securities. In addition, no more than 25% of the value of RESI's assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Except for securities that qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test above and investments in RESI's qualified REIT subsidiaries and its taxable REIT subsidiaries, its investment in the value of any one issuer\u2019s securities may not exceed 5% of the value of its total assets, and it may not own more than 10% of the total vote or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer, except, in the case of the 10% value test, certain \u201cstraight debt\u201d securities. In order to satisfy these requirements, RESI may be forced to liquidate otherwise attractive investments, potentially at a loss, which could materially and adversely affect RESI. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\nFailure to make required distributions would subject RESI to federal corporate income tax.\nWe intend to continue to operate RESI in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In order to qualify as a REIT, RESI generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, each year to its stockholders. To the extent that RESI satisfies this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of its REIT taxable income, it will be subject to federal corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, RESI will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that it pays out to its stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code.\nThe IRS may deem the gains from sales of RESI's properties to be subject to a 100% prohibited transaction tax.\nFrom time to time, RESI may be forced to sell properties that do not meet its investment objectives or it may need to sell properties, mortgage loans or other assets either because they do not meet its rental portfolio objectives or to satisfy its REIT distribution requirements. In general, REITs do not sell residential assets out of the REIT so they are not determined to be a \u201cdealer.\u201d If RESI were to purchase real estate assets with a view toward re-selling them, it could be considered a \u201cdealer\u201d of real estate, which could cause RESI to fail to meet its REIT requirements or such sales could be considered \u201cprohibited transactions.\u201d Because RESI has historically purchased large portfolios of mortgage loans with a view toward converting them into rental homes, there may be assets that it purchases as part of all-or none portfolios that are not acceptable for its portfolio and necessary to sell. Typically, RESI contributes REO properties that it determines will not meet its rental portfolio criteria to its taxable REIT subsidiary to prevent the sales from being deemed prohibited transactions. In addition, RESI has been selling its non-performing loan portfolios from its qualified REIT subsidiaries, but RESI expects to limit such portfolios to fewer than six in any calendar year based on guidance that fewer than six sales per year would not result in these transactions being \u201cprohibited transactions.\u201d The IRS may deem one or more sales of RESI's properties to be \u201cprohibited transactions.\u201d If the IRS takes the position that RESI has engaged in a \u201cprohibited transaction\u201d (i.e., if RESI sells a property held by us primarily for sale in the ordinary course of our trade or business), then any gain it recognizes from such sale would not disqualify RESI as a REIT, but such gains would be subject to a 100% tax. The Code sets forth a safe harbor for REITs that wish to sell property without risking the imposition of the 100% tax; however, there is no assurance that RESI will be able to qualify for the safe harbor. RESI does not intend to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business; however, there is no assurance that its position will not be challenged by the IRS especially if it makes frequent sales or sales of property in which it has short holding periods. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\n(table of contents)\nThe \u201ctaxable mortgage pool\u201d rules may increase the taxes that RESI or RESI\u2019s stockholders may incur, and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations.\nSecuritizations by us or our subsidiaries could result in the creation of taxable mortgage pools for U.S. federal income tax purposes, resulting in \u201cexcess inclusion income.\u201d As a REIT, so long as we own 100% of the equity interests in a taxable mortgage pool, we generally would not be adversely affected by the characterization of the securitization as a taxable mortgage pool. Certain categories of stockholders, however, such as non-U.S. stockholders eligible for treaty or other benefits, stockholders with net operating losses and certain tax-exempt U.S. stockholders that are subject to unrelated business income tax, could be subject to increased taxes on a portion of their dividend income from us that is attributable to the excess inclusion income. In the case of a stockholder that is a REIT, a regulated investment company (\u201cRIC\u201d) common trust fund or other pass-through entity, our allocable share of our excess inclusion income could be considered excess inclusion income of such entity. In addition, to the extent that our stock is owned by tax-exempt \u201cdisqualified organizations,\u201d such as certain government-related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business income, we may incur a corporate level tax on a portion of any excess inclusion income. Because this tax generally would be imposed on us, all of our stockholders, including stockholders that are not disqualified organizations, generally would bear a portion of the tax cost associated with the classification of us or a portion of our assets as a taxable mortgage pool. A RIC, or other pass-through entity owning our stock in record name will be subject to tax at the highest U.S. federal corporate tax rate on any excess inclusion income allocated to their owners that are disqualified organizations. Moreover, we could face limitations in selling equity interests in these securitizations to outside investors, or selling any debt securities issued in connection with these securitizations that might be considered to be equity interests for tax purposes. Finally, if we were to fail to maintain our REIT qualification, any taxable mortgage pool securitizations would be treated as separate taxable corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes that could not be included in any consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. These limitations may prevent us from using certain techniques to maximize our returns from securitization transactions.\nIn the future, RESI could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise equity capital to fund its distributions or to make a portion of its distributions in the form of a taxable stock distribution.\nRESI's Board of Directors has the sole discretion to determine the timing, form and amount of any distributions to its stockholders, and the amount of such distributions may be limited. In the future, RESI could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise equity capital to fund its distributions or to make a portion of its distributions in the form of a taxable stock distribution. RESI's Board of Directors will make determinations regarding distributions based upon various factors, including its historical and projected financial condition and requirements, liquidity and results of operations, financing covenants, maintenance of its REIT qualification, applicable law and other factors, as its Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. To the extent that RESI is required to sell assets in adverse market conditions or borrow funds at unfavorable rates, it could be materially and adversely affected. To the extent RESI may have to raise equity capital, it may be unable to do so at attractive prices, on a timely basis or at all, which could adversely affect its ability to make distributions to its stockholders. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.\nEven if RESI qualifies as a REIT, it may be subject to tax liabilities that could materially and adversely affect RESI.\nEven if RESI qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on its income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, property and transfer taxes. In addition, RESI could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise tax or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more of the relief provisions under the Code to maintain its qualification as a REIT. In order to meet the REIT qualification requirements or to avert the imposition of a 100% tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from sales of \u201cdealer property,\u201d RESI may also move or hold some of its assets or conduct activities through a TRS. In addition, if RESI lends money to a TRS, the TRS may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid to RESI, which could result in an even higher corporate level tax liability. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to RESI's stockholders.\nFurthermore, the Code imposes a 100% tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm\u2019s length basis. We will structure RESI's transaction with any TRS on terms that we believe are arm\u2019s length to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurances, however, that RESI will be able to avoid application of the 100% tax. Any such additional tax liabilities would have an adverse effect on RESI and us.\n(table of contents)\nRESI may be subject to legislative or regulatory tax changes that could materially and adversely affect RESI.\nAt any time, the federal income tax laws or regulations governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective, and any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively. RESI and its stockholders could be materially and adversely affected by any such change in or any new, federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate management fees.", "PERMNO": 14127, "SIC": 6500, "TIC": "AAMC"}
