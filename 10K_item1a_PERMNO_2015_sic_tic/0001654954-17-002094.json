{"cik": "1410098", "company": "CorMedix Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have a history of operating losses, expect to incur additional operating losses in the future and may never be profitable.\nOur prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of operation. We incurred net losses of approximately $24.6 million, $18.2 million and $20.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $119.2 million. We expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several years as our research, development, pre-clinical testing, clinical trial and commercialization activities increase as we develop and commercialize Neutrolin. As a result, we expect to experience negative cash flow as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain. Neutrolin was launched in December 2013 and is currently available for distribution in certain European Union and Middle East countries. We have not generated any significant commercial revenue and do not expect to generate substantial revenues from Neutrolin until it is approved by the FDA and launched in the U.S. market, and might never generate significant revenues from the sale of Neutrolin or any other products. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, the following: successfully marketing Neutrolin in Germany and other countries in which it is approved for sale; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for Neutrolin from the other applicable European and Middle East agencies, other foreign agencies and the FDA and international regulatory agencies for any other products; establishing manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements, either alone or with third parties; and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities. We might not succeed at any of these undertakings. If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have received a going concern opinion from our registered public accounting firm.\nOur operations are subject to a number of factors that can affect our operating results and financial condition. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the results of clinical testing and trial activities of our product candidates; the ability to obtain regulatory approval to market our products; ability to manufacture successfully; competition from products manufactured and sold or being developed by other companies; the price of, and demand for, our products; our ability to negotiate favorable licensing or other manufacturing and marketing agreements for our products; and our ability to raise capital to support our operations.\nTo date, our commercial operations have not generated sufficient revenues to enable profitability. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $119.2 million, and incurred net losses from operations of $24.6 million for the year then ended. Based on the current development plans for Neutrolin in both the U.S. and foreign markets (including the ongoing hemodialysis Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S.) and our other operating requirements, management believes that the existing cash at December 31, 2016 will not be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months following the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, we will need additional funding to complete the hemodialysis clinical trial in the U.S. which commenced in December 2015 as well as to initiate the planned Phase 3 clinical trial in oncology patients with catheters.\nAs a result of the above matters, our independent auditors have indicated in their report on our December 31, 2016 financial statements that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of our creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to our stockholders, in the event of liquidation.\nOur continued operations will ultimately depend on our ability to raise additional capital through various potential sources, such as equity and/or debt financings, strategic relationships, or out-licensing of our products in order to complete our ongoing and planned Phase 3 clinical trials and until we achieve profitability, if ever. We can provide no assurances that such financing or strategic relationships will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Without this funding, we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. Any additional funds that we obtain may not be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders and may require us to relinquish valuable rights.\nWe have launched Neutrolin in certain European Union and Middle East countries, but to date have no other approved product on the market and have not generated significant product revenue from Neutrolin to date. Unless and until we receive applicable regulatory approval for Neutrolin in the U.S., we cannot sell Neutrolin in the U.S. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from Neutrolin sales in Europe and other foreign markets, if approved, cash on hand, additional financings, licensing fees and grants.\nWe believe that our cash resources as of December 31, 2016, will not be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months following the balance sheet date. We will need additional funding thereafter to complete our ongoing Phase 3 hemodialysis clinical trial in the U.S., as well initiate as our planned Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. in oncology patients with catheters. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may not be able to complete our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, commence and complete our planned Phase 3 clinical trial or commercialize Neutrolin and we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs. We can provide no assurances that any financing or strategic relationships will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We expect to incur increases in our cash used in operations as we continue to commercialize Neutrolin in Europe and other markets, conduct our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial and prepare for our planned Phase 3 clinical trial in oncology patients, seek FDA approval of Neutrolin in the U.S., commercialize Neutrolin in Europe and other markets, pursue business development activities, and incur additional legal costs to defend our intellectual property.\nTo raise needed capital, we may sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain a bank credit facility, or enter into a corporate collaboration or licensing arrangement. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations. Raising additional funds through collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties may require us to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us or our stockholders.\nOur efforts to explore strategic alternatives aimed at accelerating Neutrolin\u2019s development and commercialization and maximizing shareholder value may not result in any definitive transaction or deliver the expected benefits, and may create a distraction for our management and uncertainty that may adversely affect our operating results and business.\nStrategic alternatives we may pursue could include, but are not limited to, joint ventures or partnering or other collaboration agreements, licensing arrangements, or another transaction intended to maximize shareholder value, such as a merger, a sale of the Company or some or all of its assets, or another strategic transaction. In March 2015, the Board commenced a process to evaluate our strategic alternatives in order to accelerate the global development of Neutrolin and maximize shareholder value. The Board previously engaged the investment bank Evercore Group L.L.C. to provide financial advice and assist the Board with its evaluation process. After the process with Evercore, we announced in July 2015 that we expect to continue to pursue product development and commercialization opportunities as we move forward with the planned Phase 3 clinical trials, rather than pursuing a possible sale of our company at that time. No transaction materialized pursuant to the Evercore engagement. We terminated the arrangement with Evercore in July 2016. Although we will remain open to and consider strategic partnerships, there can be no assurance that any transaction will present itself.\nThere are various uncertainties and risks relating to our evaluation and negotiation of possible strategic alternatives and our ability to consummate a definitive transaction, including:\n\u25cf\nexpected benefits may not be successfully achieved;\n\u25cf\nevaluation and negotiation of a proposed transaction may distract management from focusing our time and resources on execution of our operating plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business;\n\u25cf\nthe process of evaluating proposed transactions may be time consuming and expensive and may result in the loss of business opportunities;\n\u25cf\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in increased difficulties in retaining key employees and recruiting new employees, particularly senior management;\n\u25cf\neven if our Board of Directors negotiates a definitive agreement, successful integration or execution of the strategic alternative will be subject to additional risks;\n\u25cf\nthe current market price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that a transaction will occur, and during the period in which we are considering a transaction, the market price of our common stock could be highly volatile; and\n\u25cf\na failure to complete a transaction could result in a negative perception by investors in the Company generally and could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock, as well as lead to greater volatility in the market price of our common stock, all of which could adversely affect our ability to access the equity and financial markets, as well as our ability to explore and enter into different strategic alternatives.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nOur only product is only approved in Europe and is still in development in the U. S.\nNeutrolin currently and for at least the near future is our only current product as well as product candidate. Neturolin has received CE Mark approval in Europe, and we launched it in Germany in December 2013. We also are pursuing development of Neutrolin in the U.S. Our product commercialization and development efforts may not lead to commercially viable products for any of several reasons. For example, our product candidates may fail to be proven safe and effective in clinical trials, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue development efforts for our product candidates. Even if approved, our products may not be accepted in the marketplace. Neutrolin will require significant additional development, clinical trials, regulatory clearances and/or investment by us or our collaborators as we continue its commercialization, as will any of our other products. Specifically, we plan to expand marketing of Neutrolin in other foreign countries and to develop Neutrolin for sale in the U.S., which will take time and capital.\nWe have entered into agreements with a Saudi Arabian company to market and sell Neutrolin in Saudi Arabia, and with a South Korean company to market, sell and distribute Neutrolin in South Korea upon receipt of regulatory approval in that country. We also have some commercial presence in Germany and the United Arab Emirates. Consequently, we will be dependent on these companies and individuals for the success of sales in those countries and any other countries in which we receive regulatory approval and in which we contract with third parties for the marketing, sale and/or distribution of Neutrolin. If these companies or individuals do not perform for whatever reason, our business, prospects and results of operations will me materially adversely affected. Finding a suitable replacement organization or individual for these or any other companies or individuals with whom we might contract could be difficult, which would further harm our business, prospects and results of operations.\nSuccessful development and commercialization of our products is uncertain.\nOur development and commercialization of current and future product candidates is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf\ninability to produce positive data in pre-clinical and clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndelays in product development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, or manufacturing;\n\u25cf\nunplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing;\n\u25cf\nfailure to receive regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nemergence of superior or equivalent products;\n\u25cf\ninability to manufacture our product candidates on a commercial scale on our own, or in collaboration with third parties; and\n\u25cf\nfailure to achieve market acceptance.\nBecause of these risks, our development efforts may not result in any commercially viable products. If a significant portion of these development efforts are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained or any approved products are not commercialized successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially harmed.\nClinical trials required for our product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain.\nIn order to obtain FDA or foreign approval to market a new drug or device product, we must demonstrate proof of safety and effectiveness in humans. Foreign regulations and requirements are similar to those of the FDA. To meet FDA requirements, we must conduct \u201cadequate and well-controlled\u201d clinical trials. Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process. The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per trial. Delays associated with products for which we are directly conducting clinical trials may cause us to incur additional operating expenses. The commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including, for example:\n\u25cf\ninability to manufacture sufficient quantities of qualified materials under the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements for use in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u25cf\nfailure to recruit a sufficient number of patients;\n\u25cf\nmodification of clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf\nchanges in regulatory requirements for clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nlack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nemergence of unforeseen safety issues;\n\u25cf\ndelays, suspension, or termination of clinical trials due to the institutional review board responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site; and\n\u25cf\ngovernment or regulatory delays or \u201cclinical holds\u201d requiring suspension or termination of the trials.\nThe results from early pre-clinical and clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results to be obtained in later clinical trials. Accordingly, even if we obtain positive results from early pre-clinical or clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in later clinical trials.\nOur clinical trials may be conducted in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases for whom conventional treatments have been unsuccessful or for whom no conventional treatment exists, and in some cases, our product is expected to be used in combination with approved therapies that themselves have significant adverse event profiles. During the course of treatment, these patients could suffer adverse medical events or die for reasons that may or may not be related to our products. We cannot ensure that safety issues will not arise with respect to our products in clinical development.\nClinical trials may not demonstrate statistically significant safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates. The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indications could harm the development of our product candidates. Such a failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay the filing of any NDA or any Premarket Approval Application, or PMA, with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. Any change in, or termination of, our clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with international regulatory requirements we could be subject to regulatory delays, fines or other penalties.\nRegulatory requirements in foreign countries for international sales of medical devices often vary from country to country. The occurrence and related impact of the following factors would harm our business:\n\u25cf\ndelays in receipt of, or failure to receive, foreign regulatory approvals or clearances;\n\u25cf\nthe loss of previously obtained approvals or clearances; or\n\u25cf\nthe failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements.\nThe CE Mark is a mandatory conformity mark for products to be sold in the European Economic Area. Currently, 28 countries in Europe require products to bear CE Marking. To market in Europe, a product must first obtain the certifications necessary to affix the CE Mark. The CE Mark is an international symbol of adherence to the Medical Device Directives and the manufacturer\u2019s declaration that the product complies with essential requirements. Compliance with these requirements is ascertained within a certified Quality Management System (QMS) pursuant to ISO 13485. In order to obtain and to maintain a CE Mark, a product must be in compliance with the applicable quality assurance provisions of the aforementioned ISO and obtain certification of its quality assurance systems by a recognized European Union notified body. We received CE Mark approval for Neutrolin on July 5, 2013. However, certain individual countries within the European Union require further approval by their national regulatory agencies. Failure to receive or maintain these other requisite approvals could prohibit us from marketing and selling Neutrolin in the entire European Economic Area or elsewhere.\nWe do not have, and may never obtain, the regulatory approvals we need to market our product candidates outside of the European Union.\nWhile we have received the CE Mark approval for Neutrolin in Europe, certain individual countries within the European Union require further approval by their national regulatory agencies. Failure to receive or maintain these other requisite approvals could prohibit us from marketing and selling Neutrolin in the entire European Economic Area. In addition, we will need regulatory approval to market and sell Neutrolin in foreign countries outside of Europe. We have received regulatory approval in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\nIn the United States, we have no current application for, and have not received the regulatory approvals required for, the commercial sale of any of our products. None of our product candidates has been determined to be safe and effective in the United States, and we have not submitted an NDA or PMA to the FDA for any product. We have received approval from the FDA to proceed with our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial for Neutrolin in hemodialysis catheters and our planned Phase 3 trial in oncology patients with catheters, which is subject to finalization of the protocol with the FDA. In December 2015, we initiated the Phase 3 trial in hemodialysis catheters; however, we will not initiate the Phase 3 trial in oncology patients with catheters until we receive sufficient funding. We are seeking one or more strategic partners or other sources of capital to complete the Phase 3 trial in hemodialysis and to start the Phase 3 trial for oncology patients with catheters. However, we might not obtain any commercial partner or financing and may never start the Phase 3 clinical trial for oncology patients with catheters.\nIt is possible that Neutrolin will not receive any further approval or that any of our other product candidates will be approved for marketing. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals, or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, would adversely affect the successful commercialization of Neutrolin or any other drugs or products that we or our partners develop, impose additional costs on us or our collaborators, diminish any competitive advantages that we or our partners may attain, and/or adversely affect our cash flow.\nEven if approved, our products will be subject to extensive post-approval regulation.\nOnce a product is approved, numerous post-approval requirements apply in the United States and abroad. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if we comply with FDA, foreign and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA or a foreign regulatory body to modify or withdraw product approval.\nThe successful commercialization of Neutrolin will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of Neutrolin from third-party payors.\nSales of pharmaceutical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients\u2019 medical expenses by government health care programs and/or private health insurers, both in the U.S. and abroad. Further, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. We initially expect to sell Neutrolin directly to hospitals and key dialysis center operators, but also plan to expand its usage into intensive care, oncology and total parenteral nutrition patients needing catheters, including Medicare patients. All of these potential customers are healthcare providers who depend upon reimbursement by government and commercial insurance payors for dialysis and other treatments. Reimbursement is strictly governed by these insurance payors. We believe that Neutrolin would be eligible for coverage under various reimbursement programs, including hospital inpatient diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), outpatient ambulatory payment classification (APCs) and the End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System (ESRD PPS) or under the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) Fee Schedule, depending on the treatment setting. However, coverage by any of these reimbursement programs is not assured, and even if coverage is granted it could later be revoked or modified under future regulations. Further, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers Medicare and works with states to administer Medicaid, has adopted and will continue to adopt and/or amend rules governing reimbursement for specific treatments, including those we intend to address such as dialysis and ESRD PPS. We anticipate that CMS and private insurers will increasingly demand that manufacturers demonstrate the cost effectiveness of their products as part of the reimbursement review and approval process. Rising healthcare costs have also lead many European and other foreign countries to adopt healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures. Any measures affecting the reimbursement programs of these governmental and private insurance payors, including any uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect on reimbursement programs, could have an adverse effect on purchasing decisions regarding Neutrolin, as well as limit the prices we may charge for Neutrolin. The failure to obtain or maintain reimbursement coverage for Neutrolin or any other products could materially harm our operations.\nIn anticipation that the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and private payers will demand that we demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Neutrolin as part of the reimbursement review and approval process, we have incorporated health economic evaluations into our ongoing clinical studies to support this review in the context of the prospective use of Neutrolin in dialysis, the ICU and oncology settings. However, our studies might not be sufficient to support coverage or reimbursement at levels that allow providers to use Neutrolin.\nPhysicians and patients may not accept and use our products.\nEven with the CE Mark approval of Neutrolin, and even if we receive FDA or other foreign regulatory approval for Neutrolin or other product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept and use our products. Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including the following:\n\u25cf\nperceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug or device product;\n\u25cf\ncost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products;\n\u25cf\navailability of reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payors; and\n\u25cf\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nBecause we expect sales of Neutrolin to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of Neutrolin to find market acceptance would harm our business and would require us to seek additional financing.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe might not be able to access any of the $40.0 million available to us under our new at-the-market common stock sales program.\nIn August 2016, we entered into a sales agreement with the FBR Capital Markets & Co. whereby we can sell up to $40 million of shares of our common stock. However, pursuant to a Consent and Exchange Agreement between us and Manchester, dated September 15, 2014 (and entered into as part of our removal of anti-dilution, price reset and change of control provisions in various securities that had caused those securities to be classified as derivative liabilities), (as amended in April 2015), Manchester has a right of participation in equity financings undertaken by us prior to September 15, 2017. The participation right extends to the at-the-market common stock sales program. Any common stock sold as part of our new at-the-market common stock sales program would be subject to Manchester\u2019s participation right, Manchester\u2019s waiver of its participation right or another arrangement with Manchester. In the event we are not able to obtain such a waiver or reach an agreement with Manchester, we would not be able to sell shares of common stock in our new at-the-market program, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nCompetition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete.\nWe compete with established pharmaceutical and medical device companies that are pursuing other forms of prevention or treatment for the same indications we are pursuing and that have greater financial and other resources. Other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than we do, obtaining FDA or any other regulatory agency approval for products more rapidly, or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates. Research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in processes, treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop. We face competition from companies that internally develop competing technology or acquire competing technology from universities and other research institutions. As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop competitive positions that may prevent, make futile, or limit our product commercialization efforts, which would result in a decrease in the revenue we would be able to derive from the sale of any products.\nThere can be no assurance that Neutrolin or any other product candidate will be accepted by the marketplace as readily as these or other competing treatments. Furthermore, if our competitors\u2019 products are approved before ours, it could be more difficult for us to obtain approval from the FDA or any other regulatory agency. Even if our products are successfully developed and approved for use by all governing regulatory bodies, there can be no assurance that physicians and patients will accept any of our products as a treatment of choice.\nFurthermore, the pharmaceutical and medical device industry is diverse, complex, and rapidly changing. By its nature, the business risks associated with the industry are numerous and significant. The effects of competition, intellectual property disputes, market acceptance, and FDA or other regulatory agency regulations preclude us from forecasting revenues or income with certainty or even confidence.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims and the amount of insurance coverage we hold now or in the future may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development of drugs. If the use of one or more of our or our collaborators\u2019 drugs or devices harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products.\nWe currently carry product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials. We cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur. Our insurance covers bodily injury and property damage arising from our clinical trials, subject to industry-standard terms, conditions and exclusions. This coverage includes the sale of commercial products. We have expanded our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products due to the receipt of the CE Mark approval, but we may be unable to maintain such coverage or obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any other products approved for marketing.\nIf we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we may be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position. If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our or our collaborators\u2019 products and do not have sufficient insurance coverage, our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash and could cause the value of our capital stock to decrease.\nWe may be exposed to liability claims associated with the use of hazardous materials and chemicals.\nOur research, development and manufacturing activities and/or those of our third-party contractors may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, storing, handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local, as well as foreign, laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the federal, state and local, as well as foreign, laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare policy changes, including reimbursement policies for drugs and medical devices, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket acceptance and sales of Neutrolin or any other product candidates that we develop will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by health care reform measures in the United States and abroad. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for Neutrolin or any other product candidates that we develop. Also, we cannot be sure that the amount of reimbursement available, if any, will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Neutrolin or any other product candidates that we develop.\nIn the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Healthcare Reform Act, substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. We anticipate that if we obtain approval for our products, some of our revenue may be derived from U.S. government healthcare programs, including Medicare. Furthermore, beginning in 2011, the Healthcare Reform Act imposed a non-deductible excise tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell \u201cbranded prescription drugs,\u201d which includes innovator drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs or generics) to U.S. government programs. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have an adverse effect on our industry generally and our products specifically.\nIn addition to the Healthcare Reform Act, we expect that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to keep healthcare costs down while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for any products that are approved or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies or other third-party payors or may increase the tax requirements for life sciences companies such as ours. While it is too early to predict what effect the Healthcare Reform Act or any future legislation or regulation will have on us, such laws could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealth administration authorities in countries other than the United States may not provide reimbursement for Neutrolin or any of our other product candidates at rates sufficient for us to achieve profitability, or at all. Like the United States, these countries could adopt health care reform proposals and could materially alter their government-sponsored health care programs by reducing reimbursement rates.\nAny reduction in reimbursement rates under Medicare or private insurers or foreign health care programs could negatively affect the pricing of our products. If we are not able to charge a sufficient amount for our products, then our margins and our profitability will be adversely affected.\nIf we lose key management or scientific personnel, cannot recruit qualified employees, directors, officers, or other personnel or experience increases in compensation costs, our business may materially suffer.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff, specifically, Khoso Baluch, a director and our Chief Executive Officer, Robert Cook, our Chief Financial Officer, Judith Abrams, our Chief Medical Officer and John Armstrong, our Executive Vice President for Technical Operations. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to identify, hire, and retain current and additional personnel. We experience intense competition for qualified personnel and may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. Moreover, our work force is located in the New Jersey metropolitan area, where competition for personnel with the scientific and technical skills that we seek is extremely high and is likely to remain high. Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly. In addition, we have only limited ability to prevent former employees from competing with us.\nIf we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.\nOver time, we expect to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in clinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous pharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining such qualified personnel will be critical to our success.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth.\nOur success will depend upon the expansion of our operations to commercialize Neutrolin and the effective management of any growth, which could place a significant strain on our management and our administrative, operational and financial resources. To manage this growth, we may need to expand our facilities, augment our operational, financial and management systems and hire and train additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business may be materially harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we materially breach or default under any of our license agreements, the licensor party to such agreement will have the right to terminate the license agreement, which termination may materially harm our business.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on the maintenance of our license agreements. Each of our license agreements provides the licensor with a right to terminate the license agreement for our material breach or default under the agreement, including the failure to make any required milestone or other payments. Should the licensor under any of our license agreements exercise such a termination right, we would lose our right to the intellectual property under the respective license agreement, which loss may materially harm our business.\nIf we and our licensors do not obtain protection for and successfully defend our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing products.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining further patent protection for our products and other technologies and successfully defending any patents that we currently have or will obtain against third-party challenges. The patents which we currently believe are most material to our business are as follows:\n\u25cf\nU.S. Patent No. 8,541,393 (expiring in November 2024) (the \u201cProsl Patent\u201d) - use of Neutrolin for preventing infection and maintenance of catheter patency in hemodialysis catheters (for CRMD003);\n\u25cf\nU.S. Patent No. 6,166,007 (expiring May 2019) (the \u201cSodemann Patent\u201d) - a method of inhibiting or preventing infection and blood coagulation at a medical prosthetic device (for CRMD003); and\n\u25cf\nEuropean Patent EP 1 814 562 B1 (expiring October 12, 2025) (the \u201cProsl European Patent\u201d) - a low heparin catheter lock solution for maintaining and preventing infection in a hemodialysis catheter.\nWe are currently seeking further patent protection for our compounds and methods of treating diseases. However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u25cf\npatents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u25cf\nour competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we have and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets;\n\u25cf\nthere may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n\u25cf\ncountries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.\nIn addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nThe above mentioned patents and patent applications are exclusively licensed to us. To support our patent strategy, we have engaged in a review of patentability and certain freedom to operate issues, including performing certain searches. However, patentability and certain freedom to operate issues are inherently complex, and we cannot provide assurances that a relevant patent office and/or relevant court will agree with our conclusions regarding patentability issues or with our conclusions regarding freedom to operate issues, which can involve subtle issues of claim interpretation and/or claim liability. Furthermore, we may not be aware of all patents, published applications or published literature that may affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product candidates, preventing the patentability of our product candidates to us or our licensors, or covering the same or similar technologies that may invalidate our patents, limit the scope of our future patent claims or adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates.\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Although we take measures to protect this information by entering into confidentiality and inventions agreements with our employees, scientific advisors, consultants, and collaborators, we cannot provide any assurances that these agreements will not be breached, that we will be able to protect ourselves from the harmful effects of disclosure if they are breached, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. If any of these events occurs, or we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of our intellectual property may be greatly reduced.\nOngoing and future intellectual property disputes could require us to spend time and money to address such disputes and could limit our intellectual property rights.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. We may initiate or become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of patents and pending applications of our competitors, or we may become subject to proceedings initiated by our competitors or other third parties or the PTO or applicable foreign bodies to reexamine the patentability of our licensed or owned patents. In addition, litigation may be necessary to enforce our issued patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of the proprietary rights of others.\nWe initiated court proceedings in Germany for patent infringement and unfair use of our proprietary information related to Neutrolin (as described below). We also have had opposition proceedings brought against the European Patent and the German utility model patent which are the basis of our infringement proceedings (as described below). The defense and prosecution of these ongoing and any future intellectual property suits, PTO or foreign proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain. An adverse determination in litigation or PTO or foreign proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, including damages, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets, or invalidate or render unenforceable our licensed or owned patents. Although patent and intellectual property disputes might be settled through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include our paying large fixed payments and ongoing royalties. Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all.\nIn February 2007, Geistlich S\u00f6hne AG f\u00fcr Chemische Industrie, Switzerland (\u201cGeistlich\u201d) brought an action against the European Sodemann Patent covering our Neutrolin product candidate, which is owned by ND Partners, LLC (\u201cNDP\u201d) and licensed to us pursuant to the License and Assignment Agreement between us and NDP. This action was brought at the Board of the European Patent Office (\u201cEPO\u201d) opposition division (the \u201cOpposition Board\u201d) based upon alleged lack of inventiveness in the use of citric acid and a pH value in the range of 4.5 to 6.5 with having the aim to provide an alternative lock solution through having improved anticoagulant characteristics compared to the lock solutions of the prior art. The Opposition Board rejected the opposition by Geistlich. In a letter dated September 30, 2013, we were notified that the opposition division of the EPO reopened the proceedings before the first instance and gave their preliminary non-binding opinion that the patent as amended during the appeal proceedings fulfills the requirements of clarity, novelty, and inventive step, and invited the parties to provide their comments and/or requests by February 10, 2014. We filed our response on February 3, 2014 to request that the patent be maintained as amended during the appeal proceedings. Geistlich did not file a further statement within the required timeline. On November 5, 2014, the Opposition Division at the EPO issued the interlocutory decision to maintain the patent on the basis of the claims as amended during the appeal proceedings. This decision became final as no further appeal was lodged by Geistlich.\nOn September 9, 2014, we filed in the District Court of Mannheim, Germany a patent infringement action against TauroPharm GmbH and Tauro-Implant GmbH as well as their respective CEOs (the \u201cDefendants\u201d) claiming infringement of our European Patent EP 1 814 562 B1, which was granted by the EPO on January 8, 2014 (the \u201cProsl European Patent\u201d). The Prosl European Patent covers a low dose heparin catheter lock solution for maintaining patency and preventing infection in a hemodialysis catheter. In this action, we claim that the Defendants infringe on the Prosl European Patent by manufacturing and distributing catheter locking solutions to the extent they are covered by the claims of the Prosl European Patent. We believe that our patent is sound, and are seeking injunctive relief and raising claims for information, rendering of accounts, calling back, destruction and damages. Separately, TauroPharm has filed an opposition with the EPO against the Prosl European Patent alleging that it lacks novelty and inventive step. We cannot predict what other defenses the Defendants may raise, or the ultimate outcome of either of these related matters.\nIn the same complaint against the same Defendants, we also alleged an infringement (requesting the same remedies) of NDP\u2019s utility model DE 20 2005 022 124 U1 (the \u201cUtility Model\u201d), which we believe is fundamentally identical to the Prosl European Patent in its main aspects and claims. The Court separated the two proceedings and the Prosl European Patent and the Utility Model claims are now being tried separately. TauroPharm has filed a cancellation action against the Utility Model before the German Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cGerman PTO\u201d) based on the similar arguments as those in the opposition against the Prosl European Patent.\nOn March 27, 2015, the District Court held a hearing to evaluate whether the Utility Model has been infringed by TauroPharm in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of its TauroLock-HEP100TM and TauroLock-HEP500TM products. A hearing before the same court was held on January 30, 2015 on the separate, but related, question of infringement of the Prosl European Patent by TauroPharm.\nThe Court issued its decisions on May 8, 2015 staying both proceedings. In its decisions, the Court found that the commercialization by TauroPharm in Germany of its TauroLock catheter lock solutions Hep100 and Hep500 infringes both the Prosl European Patent and the Utility Model and further that there is no prior use right that would allow TauroPharm to continue to make, use or sell its product in Germany. However, the Court declined to issue an injunction in favor of us that would preclude the continued commercialization by TauroPharm based upon its finding that there is a sufficient likelihood that the EPO, in the case of the Prosl European Patent, or the German PTO, in the case of the Utility Model, may find that such patent or utility model is invalid. Specifically, the Court noted the possible publication of certain instructions for product use that may be deemed to constitute prior art. As such, the District Court determined that it will defer any consideration of the request by us for injunctive and other relief until such time as the EPO or the German PTO has ruled on the underlying validity of the Prosl European Patent and the Utility Model.\nThe opposition proceeding against the Prosl European Patent before the EPO is ongoing. In its preliminary consideration of the matter, the EPO (and the German PTO) regarded the patent as not inventive or novel due to publication of prior art. Oral proceedings before the Opposition Division at the EPO were held on November 25, 2015, at which the three judge patent examiner panel considered arguments related to the validity of the Prosl European Patent. The hearing was adjourned due to the fact that the panel was of the view that Claus Herdeis, one of the managing directors of TauroPharm, has to be heard as a witness in a further hearing in order to close some gaps in the documentation presented by TauroPharm as regards the publication of prior art. In October 2016, TauroPharm submitted a further writ to the EPO requesting a date for the hearing and bringing forward further arguments, in particular in view of the recent decision of the German PTO on the invalidity of the utility model. The EPO has scheduled a further oral hearing for November 22 / 23, 2017. While we continue to believe that the referenced publication and instructions for use do not, in fact, constitute prior art and that the Prosl European Patent will be found to be valid by the EPO, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in this matter.\nThe German PTO held a hearing in the validity proceedings relating to the Utility Model on June 29, 2016, at which the panel affirmed its preliminary finding that the Utility Model was invalid based upon prior publication of a reference to the benefits that may be associated with adding heparin to a taurolidine based solution. The decision is subject to appeal and has only a declaratory effect, as the Utility Model had expired in November 2015. Furthermore, it has no bearing on the ongoing consideration of the validity and possible infringement of the Prosl Patent by the EPO. We filed an appeal against the ruling on September 7, 2016.\nOn January 16, 2015, we filed a complaint against TauroPharm GmbH and its managing directors in the District Court of Cologne, Germany. In the complaint, we allege violation of the German Unfair Competition Act by TauroPharm for the unauthorized use of its proprietary information obtained in confidence by TauroPharm. We allege that TauroPharm is improperly and unfairly using its proprietary information relating to the composition and manufacture of Neutrolin, in the manufacture and sale of TauroPharm\u2019s products TauroLockTM, TauroLock-HEP100 and TauroLock-HEP500. We seek a cease and desist order against TauroPharm from continuing to manufacture and sell any product containing taurolidine (the active pharmaceutical ingredient (\u201cAPI\u201d) of Neutrolin) and citric acid in addition to possible other components, damages for any sales in the past and the removal of all such products from the market. An initial hearing in the District Court of Cologne, Germany was held on November 19, 2015 to consider our claims. The judge made no decision on the merits of our complaint. On January 14, 2016, the court issued an interim decision in the form of a court order outlining several issues of concern that relate primarily to court's interest in clarifying the facts and reviewing any and all available documentation, in particular with regard to the question which specific know-how was provided to TauroPharm by whom and when. We have prepared the requested reply and produced the respective documentation. TauroPharm has also filed another writ within the same deadline and both parties have filed further writs at the end of April setting out their respective argumentation in more detail. A further oral hearing was held on November 15, 2016. The court made no rulings from the bench, and indicated that it is prepared to further examine the underlying facts of our allegations. At this time, there are no further hearings scheduled. We intend to continue to pursue this matter, and to provide additional supplemental documentary and other evidence as may be necessary to support our claims.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties we could be prevented from selling products and forced to pay damages and defend against litigation.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\nobtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf\nabandon an infringing product candidate;\n\u25cf\nredesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u25cf\nstop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u25cf\npay damages; or\n\u25cf\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings, which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nRisks Related to Dependence on Third Parties\nIf we are not able to develop and maintain collaborative marketing relationships with licensees or partners, or create an effective sales, marketing, and distribution capability, we may be unable to market our products or market them successfully.\nOur business strategy for Neutrolin relies on collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling medical devices and pharmaceutical products; for other products we may also rely on such marketing collaborations or out-licensing of our product candidates. Specifically, for Neutrolin, we have entered into an agreement with a German company to market and sell Neutrolin in Germany and a distributor agreement with each of a Saudi Arabian and a South Korean company for sales and marketing in those two countries (upon receipt of approval to market in South Korea). In addition, we have an independent sales representative marketing and selling in the Middle East. Assuming we receive applicable regulatory approval for other markets, we plan to enter into distribution agreements with one or more third parties for the sale of Neutrolin in various European, Middle East and other markets. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain those relationships or establish and maintain additional marketing, sales, or distribution relationships. Nor can there be assurance that such relationships will be successful, or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for our products. To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or distribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues will be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly, and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third-parties.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain such third-party sales and marketing relationships, or choose not to do so, we will have to establish our own in-house capabilities. We currently have no sales, marketing, or distribution infrastructure. To market any of our products directly, we would need to develop a marketing, sales, and distribution force that has both technical expertise and the ability to support a distribution capability. The establishment of a marketing, sales, and distribution capability would take time and significantly increase our costs, possibly requiring substantial additional capital. In addition, there is intense competition for proficient sales and marketing personnel, and we may not be able to attract individuals who have the qualifications necessary to market, sell, and distribute our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities. If we are unable to, or choose not to establish these capabilities, or if the capabilities we establish are not sufficient to meet our needs, we will be required to establish collaborative marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with third parties, which we might not be able to do on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe currently have no internal marketing and sales organization and currently rely and intend to continue to rely on third parties to market and sell Neutrolin. If we are unable to enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell Neutrolin or any other product after approval or are unable to establish our own marketing and sales capabilities, we may not be able to generate significant or any product revenues.\nWe do not have an internal sales organization. To date we have relied, and intend to continue to rely, on third parties for the marketing, sales and distribution of Neutrolin and any other product we might develop. However, we may not be able to maintain current and future arrangements or enter into new arrangements with third parties to sell Neutrolin or any other product on favorable terms or at all. In that event, we would have to develop our own marketing and sales force. The establishment and development of our own sales force would be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully develop this capability. In addition, the use of third parties to commercialize our approved products reduces the revenues that we would receive if we commercialized these products ourselves.\nWe have entered into agreements with independent companies to market Neutrolin in Germany and in Saudi Arabia and, upon regulatory approval, South Korea. We also have an independent sales representative in the Middle East. We intend to seek a sales partner in the U.S. if Neutrolin receives FDA approval. Consequently, we will be dependent on these firms and individuals for the success of sales in these and any other countries in which approval is granted. If these firms or individuals do not perform for whatever reason, our business, prospects and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Finding a new or replacement organization for sales and marketing could be difficult, which would further harm our business, prospects and results of operations.\nIf we or our collaborators are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for a manufacturing facility, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and we may lose potential revenues.\nCompletion of our clinical trials and commercialization of Neutrolin and any other product candidate require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our product candidates. All of our manufacturing processes currently are, and we expect them to continue to be, outsourced to third parties. Specifically, we will rely on one or more manufacturers to supply us and/or our distribution partners with commercial quantities of Neutrolin. If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on our current sources for the manufacture of Neutrolin or any other product candidates or for active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, either for clinical trials or for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for pre-clinical, clinical, and commercial purposes. We may not be successful in identifying such additional or replacement third-party manufacturers, or in negotiating acceptable terms with any that we do identify. Such third-party manufacturers must receive FDA or applicable foreign approval before they can produce clinical material or commercial product, and any that are identified may not receive such approval or may fail to maintain such approval. In addition, we may be in competition with other companies for access to these manufacturers\u2019 facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacturing if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us. If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance may be materially affected.\nBefore we could begin to commercially manufacture Neutrolin or any other product candidate on our own, we must obtain regulatory approval of the manufacturing facility and process. The manufacture of drugs for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with cGMP and applicable non-U.S. regulatory requirements. The cGMP requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures. Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements would require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We would also have to pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA or non-U.S. regulatory agency approval. Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay regulatory approval of our products. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCorporate and academic collaborators may take actions that delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our products.\nOur operating and financial strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of our product candidates is heavily dependent on our entering into collaborations with corporations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties. Our current strategy assumes that we will successfully establish and maintain these collaborations or similar relationships. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful establishing or maintaining such collaborations. Some of our existing collaborations, such as our licensing agreements, are, and future collaborations may be, terminable at the sole discretion of the collaborator in certain circumstances. Replacement collaborators might not be available on attractive terms, or at all.\nIn addition, the activities of any collaborator will not be within our control and may not be within our power to influence. There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all, that we will derive any revenue or profits from such collaborations, or that any collaborator will not compete with us. If any collaboration is not pursued, we may require substantially greater capital to undertake on our own the development and marketing of our product candidates and may not be able to develop and market such products successfully, if at all. In addition, a lack of development and marketing collaborations may lead to significant delays in introducing product candidates into certain markets and/or reduced sales of products in such markets.\nData provided by collaborators and others upon which we rely that has not been independently verified could turn out to be false, misleading, or incomplete.\nWe rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical trials, and business. If such third parties provide inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data, our business, prospects, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nPrior to fiscal 2015, we had identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and our current internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent all possible errors that could occur.\nIn the several years prior to fiscal 2015, we had identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that was related to our limited finance staff and the resulting ineffective management review over financial reporting, coupled with increasingly complex accounting treatments associated with our financing activities and European expansion. While we remediated this material weakness in 2015, we cannot be assured that material weaknesses will not arise again.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be satisfied. Internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to give a reasonable assurance that they are effective to achieve their objectives. We cannot provide absolute assurance that all of our possible future control issues will be detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in our decision making can be faulty, and that isolated breakdowns can occur because of simple human error or mistake. The design of our system of controls is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed absolutely in achieving our stated goals under all potential future or unforeseeable conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error could occur and not be detected. This and any future failures could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and stock price.\nOur common stock price has fluctuated considerably and is likely to remain volatile, in part due to the limited market for our common stock and you could lose all or a part of your investment.\nDuring the period from the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO, on March 30, 2010 through February 28, 2017, the high and low sales prices for our common stock were $10.40 and $0.15, respectively. There is a limited public market for our common stock and we cannot provide assurances that an active trading market will develop. As a result of low trading volume in our common stock, the purchase or sale of a relatively small number of shares could result in significant share price fluctuations.\nAdditionally, the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of Neutrolin in those markets in which it is approved for sale;\n\u25cf\nour need for additional capital;\n\u25cf\nthe receipt of or failure to obtain additional regulatory approvals for Neutrolin, including FDA approval in the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates, including our planned Phase 3 trial for Neutrolin in the U.S., or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nour entry into or the loss of a significant collaboration;\n\u25cf\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, including changes in the healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts relating to our common stock;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by our competitors of significant developments, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u25cf\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales or anticipated sales of our securities by us or our stockholders; and\n\u25cf\nany other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the stock of pharmaceutical and medical device companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFor these reasons and others, an investment in our securities is risky and invest only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the value of your investment.\nA significant number of additional shares of our common stock may be issued at a later date, and their sale could depress the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding the following securities that are convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock:\n\u25cf\nwarrants for 227,273 shares of common stock issued in July 2013 with an exercise price of $1.50 that expire on July 30, 2018;\n\u25cf\nwarrants for 500,000 shares of common stock issued in May 2013 with an exercise price of $0.65 per share that expire on May 30, 2019;\n\u25cf\nwarrants for 125,000 shares issued to ND Partners in April 2013 in connection with the amendment to the license and assignment agreement with an exercise price of $1.50 per share that expire on April 11, 2018;\n\u25cf\noptions to purchase an aggregate of 130,000 shares of our common stock issued to our officers, directors, employees and non-employee consultants under our Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2006 Stock Plan, with a weighted average exercise price of $1.38 per share;\n\u25cf\noptions to purchase an aggregate of 4,479,755 shares of our common stock issued to our officers, directors and non-employee consultants under our 2013 Stock Plan, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.31 per share;\n\u25cf\nwarrants issued to investors in our 2012 private placement to purchase an aggregate of 312,500 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $0.40 per share, which expire on September 20, 2017;\n\u25cf\na warrant for 795 shares of our common stock issued to the placement agent for our 2012 private placement with an exercise price of $0.40 per share, which expires on September 20, 2017;\n\u25cf\na warrant to purchase 400,000 shares of our common stock issued on February 19, 2013 with an exercise price of $1.50 that expire on February 19, 2018;\n\u25cf\nwarrants for 750,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.90 that expire on October 22, 2019;\n\u25cf\nwarrants for 725,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.90 that expire on January 8, 2020;\n\u25cf\nSeries C-2 Preferred Stock convertible into 1,500,000 shares of common;\n\u25cf\nSeries C-3 Preferred Stock convertible into 1,365,000 shares of common stock;\n\u25cf\nSeries D Preferred Stock convertible into 1,479,240 shares of common stock;\n\u25cf\nSeries E Preferred Stock convertible into 1,959,759 shares of common stock;\n\u25cf\nwarrants for 682,500 shares of common stock issued in March 2014 with an exercise price of $2.50 per shares that expire on September 10, 2019;\n\u25cf\nwarrants for 200,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $7.00 that expire on March 3, 2020; and\n\u25cf\nwarrants for 83,400 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $7.00 that expire on March 25, 2020.\nThe possibility of the issuance of these shares, as well as the actual sale of such shares, could substantially reduce the market price for our common stock and impede our ability to obtain future financing.\nWe will need additional financing to fund our activities in the future, which likely will dilute our stockholders.\nTo date, our commercial operations have not generated sufficient revenues to enable profitability. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $119.2 million, and incurred net losses from operations of $24.6 million for the year then ended. Based on the current development plans for Neutrolin in both the U.S. and foreign markets (including the ongoing hemodialysis Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S.) and our other operating requirements, management believes that the existing cash at December 31, 2016 will not be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months following the balance sheet date. Additionally, we will need additional funding to complete the hemodialysis clinical trial in the U.S. which commenced in December 2015 as well as to initiate the planned Phase 3 clinical trial in oncology patients with catheters. Further, we anticipate that we will incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we will require substantial funds in the future to support our operations. We expect to seek equity or debt financings in the future to fund our operations. The issuance of additional equity securities, or convertible debt or other derivative securities, likely will dilute some if not all of our then existing stockholders, depending on the financing terms.\nFuture sales and issuances of our equity securities or rights to purchase our equity securities, including pursuant to equity incentive plans, would result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may, as we have in the past, sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be further diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders.\nPursuant to our 2013 Stock Plan, our Board of Directors is authorized to award up to a total of 11,000,000 shares of common stock or options to purchase shares of common stock to our officers, directors, employees and non-employee consultants. As of December 31, 2016, options to purchase 130,000 shares of common stock issued under our 2006 Stock Plan at a weighted average exercise price of $1.38 per share, and options to purchase 4,479,755 shares of common stock issued under our 2013 Stock Plan at a weighted average exercise price of $2.31 per share were outstanding. In addition, at December 31, 2016, there were outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,006,468 shares of our common stock at prices ranging from $0.40 to $7.00, and shares of our outstanding Series C-2, C-3, D and E preferred stock convertible into an aggregate of 6,303,999 shares of our common stock. Stockholders will experience dilution in the event that additional shares of common stock are issued under our 2006 Stock Plan or 2013 Stock Plan, or options issued under our 2006 Stock Plan or 2013 Stock Plan are exercised, or any warrants are exercised for, or preferred stock shares are converted to, common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or DGCL, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting our stockholders from fixing the number of our directors; and\n\u25cf\nestablishing advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our Board of Directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by the board of directors. This provision could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, our stockholders. Any provision of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or Amended and Restated Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT, it may result in a delisting of our common stock from the exchange.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on the NYSE MKT, and the continued listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. These listing standards include the requirement for avoiding sustained losses and maintaining a minimum level of stockholders\u2019 equity. In 2012 and 2014, we received notices from the NYSE MKT that we did not meet continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT as set forth in Part 10 of the Company Guide. Specifically, we were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide because we reported stockholders\u2019 equity of less than the required amounts. As a result, we became subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide and were subject to possible delisting. In March 2015, we regained compliance with the NYSE MKT listing requirements due to our market capitalization, pursuant to Section 1003(a) of the Company Guide. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT.\nIf our common stock were no longer listed on the NYSE MKT, investors might only be able to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board \u00ae or in the Pink Sheets \u00ae (a quotation medium operated by Pink Sheets LLC). This would impair the liquidity of our common stock not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price, which might be depressed by the relative illiquidity, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in media coverage.\nBecause the average daily trading volume of our common stock has been low historically, the ability to sell our shares in the secondary trading market may be limited.\nBecause the average daily trading volume of our common stock on the NYSE MKT has been low historically, the liquidity of our common stock may be impaired. As a result, prices for shares of our common stock may be lower than might otherwise prevail if the average daily trading volume of our common stock was higher. The average daily trading volume of our common stock may be low relative to the stocks of other exchange-listed companies, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to sell shares in the secondary trading market.\nPenny stock regulations may impose certain restrictions on marketability of our securities.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. A security listed on a national securities exchange is exempt from the definition of a penny stock. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT and so is not considered a penny stock. However, if we fail to maintain our common stock\u2019s listing on the NYSE MKT, our common stock would be considered a penny stock. In that event, our common stock would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by such rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer\u2019s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Broker-dealers must wait two business days after providing buyers with disclosure materials regarding a security before effecting a transaction in such security. Consequently, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and affect the ability of investors to sell our securities in the secondary market and the price at which such purchasers can sell any such securities, thereby affecting the liquidity of the market for our common stock.\nStockholders should be aware that, according to the SEC, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include:\n\u25cf\ncontrol of the market for the security by one or more broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer;\n\u25cf\nmanipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;\n\u25cf\n\u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons;\n\u25cf\nexcessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and\n\u25cf\nthe wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns on our common stock will be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never declared dividends on our common stock, and currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Pursuant to the terms of our Series D and E Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, we may not declare or pay any dividends or make any distributions on any of our shares or other equity securities as long as any of those preferred shares remain outstanding. We currently expect to retain future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our business. The payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon such factors as earnings levels, capital requirements, our overall financial condition and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Any return to holders of our common stock will be limited to the value of their common stock.", "PERMNO": 93371, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CRMD"}
