{"cik": "96699", "company": "TECHNICAL COMMUNICATIONS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors that affect our business. Such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those that are expressed or implied by forward-looking statements contained herein. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. You should also consider the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020 and subsequent quarterly reports filed with the SEC.\nWe have suffered recurring operating losses from operations and there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020, the Company generated a net loss of $911,000. Although the company generated $631,000 of net income in the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, for the prior seven year period from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2018, the Company suffered recurring losses from operations. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $3,066,000 at September 26, 2020. These factors continue to raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Such consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Moreover, the going concern explanatory paragraph included in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm may make obtaining financing more difficult or costly, which financing may be required should our efforts to raise capital resources from operations prove unsuccessful.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and may adversely affect our operations and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may have a significant and adverse impact on our business. The full extent to which COVID-19 will impact our operating results and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new medical and other information that may emerge concerning the virus and the actions by governmental entities or others to address and contain it.\nAs a result of COVID-19, many of our customers have closed their operations and as a result we are experiencing delays in orders. We believe these are only delays and that as we and our customers return to more normal operations these orders will be restored and future orders will resume on a more predictable basis, but we can make no assurances. While we have not experienced any significant supply problems and there have been no materially late deliveries of components or parts to date, it is possible that in a period of sustained disruption we may encounter problems in the manufacturing process or shortages in parts, components or other elements vital to the manufacture, production and sale of our products.\nDue to local governmental orders, most employees were required to fully or partially work from home for a short period in the spring of 2020. It is possible that new restrictions could significantly limit the resources available to develop, manufacture and sell our products. In December 2020 the Company implemented a partial furlough plan for the majority of salaried employees. Although we have been able to and believe we will continue to be able to retain our employees and maintain all vital functions, it is likely that in a period of continued sustained disruption we would be forced to further furlough or terminate some or all of our employees.\nFinally, we cannot be certain that we will have access to sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for the time required to allow our customer operations to resume or normalize. Although we were able to secure loans under the Small Business Administration\u2019s Payroll Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan program during fiscal 2020, we may not be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms or at all, and any additional relief provided by lenders or governmental agencies may be insufficient to support our operations until business returns to normal.\nOur management has determined that the Company\u2019s disclosure control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective for fiscal year-end September 28, 2019.\nOur management team, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the Company\u2019s 2019 fiscal year. Management had concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to the misapplication of generally accepted accounting principles associated with revenue recognition, inventory reserves, accruals and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the classification and disclosure of financial information, all caused by a lack of adequate skills and experience within the accounting department. In addition, management identified a material weakness due to a lack of sufficient staff to segregate accounting duties, as well as a material weakness in internal control over significant non-routine transactions, all as disclosed in the relevant quarterly reports filed during our 2018 fiscal year. These conditions have led management to conclude that neither the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures nor its internal control over financial reporting were effective at September 28, 2019.\nThe Company believes it mitigated these material weaknesses during fiscal 2020. Although we review and evaluate our internal control systems on a regular basis, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in the future or that any corrective actions taken to remediate issues identified during the course of an assessment will be effective. Any such additional weaknesses could materially adversely affect our financial condition or ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements.\nOur quarterly operating results typically fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain.\nWe have experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results during the last several years and anticipate continued substantial fluctuations in our future operating results. A number of factors have contributed to these quarterly fluctuations, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 foreign political unrest;\n\u2022 budgeting cycles of customers, including the U.S. government;\n\u2022 introduction and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements by us and our competitors;\n\u2022 timing and execution of individual contracts;\n\u2022 competitive conditions in the communications security industry;\n\u2022 changes in general economic conditions; and\n\u2022 shortfalls of revenues in relation to expectations that formed the basis for the calculation of fixed expenses.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks.\nThe Company is dependent upon its foreign revenue (including domestic sales shipped to foreign end-users) and we expect that revenue to foreign end-users will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls, trade barriers and trade disputes, regulations related to customs and export/import matters, fluctuations in foreign economies and currency exchange rates, longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, the complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives, consultants and distributors, tax uncertainties and unanticipated tax costs due to foreign taxing regimes, the difficulty of managing and operating an enterprise spanning several countries, the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights and differing legal systems generally, compliance with a variety of laws, and economic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including international hostilities, armed conflicts, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships, and military and political alliances.\nWe also may not be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses to conduct operations abroad, including the export of many of the Company\u2019s products, and the U.S. government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments or certain international end-users. Export restrictions, compliance with which imposes additional burdens on the Company, may further provide a competitive advantage to foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their products and services.\nWe continue to focus efforts in emerging markets, including the Middle East, Northern Africa and Southwest Asia. In many of these emerging markets, we may be faced with risks that are more significant than if we were to do business in developed countries, including undeveloped legal systems, unstable governments and economies, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods and currency.\nWe continue to face a number of risks related to current global economic and political conditions that could unfavorably impact our business.\nGlobal economic conditions continue to be challenging for the secure communications markets, as many economies and financial markets remain in a recession resulting from a number of factors, including the impact of the pandemic, adverse credit conditions, low economic growth rates, continuing high rates of unemployment, and reduced corporate capital spending. Economic growth in many other countries has remained low and the length of time these adverse economic conditions may persist, including as a result of COVID-19, is unknown. In addition, conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere have created many economic and political uncertainties that have impacted worldwide markets. These global economic and political conditions have impacted and will continue to impact our business in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022 Budgeting and forecasting are difficult: It is difficult to estimate changes in various parts of the U.S. and world economy, including the markets in which we participate. Components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of demand for our products, and the prevailing economic and political uncertainties make estimating future income and expenditures difficult.\n\u2022 Potential deferment or cancellation of purchases and orders by customers: Uncertainty about current and future global economic and political conditions may cause, and in some cases has caused, governments and businesses to defer or cancel purchases. If future demand for our products declines due to deteriorating global economic and political conditions, it will negatively impact our financial results.\n\u2022 Customers' inability to obtain financing to make purchases: Some of our customers require substantial financing, including government financing, in order to fund their operations and make purchases from us. The inability of these customers to obtain sufficient credit or other funds to finance purchases and/or meet their payment obligations could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to respond to rapid technological changes in the markets in which we compete.\nThe markets for TCC\u2019s products and services are characterized by rapid technological developments, changing customer technological requirements and preferences, frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications, and evolving industry standards. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to correctly identify emerging technological trends, enhance capabilities, and develop and manufacture new technologies and products quickly, in a cost-effective manner, and at competitive prices. The development of new and enhanced products is a complex and costly process. We may need to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to develop and introduce such new products and enhancements. Our choices for developing technologies may prove incorrect if customers do not adopt the products we develop or if the technologies ultimately prove to be technically or commercially unviable. Development schedules also may be adversely affected as the result of the discovery of performance problems. If we fail to timely develop and introduce competitive new technologies, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nExisting or new competitors may develop competing or superior technologies.\nThe industry in which the Company competes is highly competitive, and the Company has several domestic and foreign competitors. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution and other resources, greater name recognition and longer standing relationships with customers. Competitors with greater financial resources can be more aggressive in marketing campaigns, can survive sustained price reductions in order to gain market share, and can devote greater resources to support existing products and develop new competing products. Any period of sustained price reductions for our products would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. TCC may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competitive pressures may result in price reductions, loss of market share or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. It is also possible that competing products will emerge that may be superior in quality and performance and/or less expensive than those of the Company, or that similar technologies may render TCC\u2019s products obsolete or uncompetitive and prevent the Company from achieving or sustaining profitable operations.\nThe operating performance of our products is critical to our business and reputation.\nThe sale and use of our products entail a risk of product failure, product liability or other claims. Occasionally, some of our products have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or the software used in the product. Often these issues are discovered prior to shipment and may result in shipping delays or even cancellation of orders by customers. Other times problems are discovered after the products have shipped, requiring us to resolve issues in a manner that is timely and least disruptive to our customers. Such pre-shipment and post-shipment problems have ramifications for TCC, including cancellation of orders, product returns, increased costs associated with product repair or replacement, and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation.\nOnce our products are in use, any product failure, including software or hardware failure, which causes a breach of security with respect to our customer\u2019s confidential communications could have a material adverse effect on TCC. There is no guarantee of product performance or that our products are adequate to protect against all security breaches. While we attempt to mitigate such risks by maintaining insurance and including warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our arrangements with customers, such mitigation measures may not protect us against liability in all instances. If our products failed for any reason, our clients could experience data loss, financial loss, personal and property losses, harm to reputation, and significant business interruption. Such events may expose us to substantial liability, increased regulation and/or penalties, as well as loss of customer business and a diminished reputation. Any product liability claims and related litigation would likely be time-consuming and expensive, may not be adequately covered by insurance, and may delay or terminate research and development efforts, regulatory approvals and commercialization activities.\nIf our products and services do not interoperate with our end-users\u2019 products, orders could be delayed or cancelled, which could significantly reduce our revenues.\nOur products are designed to interface with our end-users\u2019 existing products, each of which has different specifications and utilizes multiple protocol standards. Many of our end-users\u2019 systems contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these systems have grown and evolved. Our products and services must interoperate with all of these products and services as well as with future products and services that might be added to meet our end-users\u2019 requirements. If our products do not interface with those within our end-users\u2019 products and systems, orders for our products could be delayed or cancelled, which could significantly reduce our revenues.\nGovernment regulation and legal uncertainties could harm our business.\nAs a party to a number of contracts with the U.S. government and its agencies, the Company must comply with extensive regulations with respect to bid proposals and billing practices. Should the U.S. government or its agencies conclude that the Company has not adhered to federal regulations, any contracts to which the Company is a party could be canceled and the Company could be prohibited from bidding on or participating in future contracts. Moreover, payments to the Company for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to audit and adjustment. The Company could be required to return any payments received from U.S. government agencies if it is found to have violated federal regulations. There have been no government audits in recent years and the Company believes the result of such audits, should they occur, would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations, though we can give no assurances.\nThe Company\u2019s security products are subject to export restrictions administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Department of State, which license the export of encryption products, subject to certain technical restrictions. In addition, U.S. export laws prohibit the export of encryption products to a number of hostile countries and some end-users. Although to date the Company has been able to secure necessary U.S. government export licenses, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to secure such licenses in a timely manner in the future, or at all. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals could be costly in terms of lost sales opportunities and compliance costs. Should export restrictions increase or regulations become more restrictive, or should new laws be enacted, it could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s international business, which impact could be material.\nContracts with the U.S. government may not be fully funded at inception and are subject to termination.\nA portion of our revenues has historically been generated under agreements with the U.S. government. Any changes or delays in the budget of the U.S. government, and in particular defense spending, could affect our business, and funding levels are difficult to predict with any certainty. Moreover, certain multi-year contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of appropriations. However, funds are typically appropriated on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years, making future sales and revenues under multi-year contracts uncertain. Changes in appropriations and budgets as well as economic conditions generally in subsequent years may impact the funding for these contracts. In addition, changes in funding and other factors may lead to the termination of such contracts. In addition, U.S. government contracts may be canceled at any time by the government with limited or no notice or penalty. Adverse changes in funding and the termination of government contracts could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the protection of our intellectual property is inadequate, our competitors may gain access to our technologies.\nThe Company\u2019s technological expertise and experience, including certain proprietary rights that it has developed and maintains as trade secrets, are crucial to the conduct of the Company\u2019s business and its ability to compete in the marketplace. Such technological expertise and experience are important as they enable an efficient design and development process. Loss of this experience and expertise would have an adverse impact on the Company. To protect our proprietary information, we rely primarily on a combination of internal procedures, contractual provisions, and copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. Such internal procedures and contractual provisions may not prove sufficient to maintain the confidentiality and proprietary nature of such information and may not provide meaningful protection in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. Trade secret and copyright laws afford only limited protection. Current and potential trademarks and patents may not provide us with any competitive advantage and patents and trademarks must be enforced and maintained in order to provide protection, which may prove costly and time-consuming.\nDespite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us may be inadequate to deter unauthorized parties from misappropriating our technologies or prevent them from obtaining and using our proprietary information, products and technologies. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or design around patents issued to us.\nOther parties may have patent rights relating to the same subject matter covered by our products or technologies, enabling them to prevent us from operating without obtaining a license and paying royalties. Third parties also may challenge our proprietary rights or claim we are infringing on their rights. Any claims of infringement or misappropriation, with or without merit, would likely be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, and cause delays in the development and commercialization of our products. We may be required to expend significant resources to develop non-infringing intellectual property, pay royalties, or obtain licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of such litigation. Royalties may be costly and licenses, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, the absence of which could seriously harm our business.\nIn addition, the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries with respect to intellectual property may not offer the same level of protection as do the laws of the United States. Legal protections of our rights may be ineffective in such countries, and technologies developed in such countries may not be protected in jurisdictions where protection is ordinarily available. Our inability to protect our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on a small number of customers for a large percentage of its revenues.\nWe will be successful only if a significant number of customers adopt our secure communications products. Historically the Company has had a small number of customers representing a large percentage of its total revenue. Although the Company endeavors to expand its customer base, we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenues in any given period for the foreseeable future. This reliance makes us particularly susceptible to factors affecting those customers. If such customers\u2019 business declines and as a result our sales to such customers decline without corresponding sales orders from other customers, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. It is difficult to predict the rate at which customers will use our products, even in the case of repeat customers, and we do not typically have long-term contractual arrangements.\nWe may not be able to maintain effective product distribution channels.\nWe rely on an in-house sales force as well as domestic and international representatives, consultants and distributors for the sale and distribution of our products. Our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against more extensive and well-funded operations of certain of our competitors. In addition, we must manage sales and marketing personnel in numerous countries around the world with the concomitant difficulties in maintaining effective communications due to distance, language and cultural barriers. Further, certain of our distributors may carry competing products lines, which may negatively impact our net revenues.\nWe rely on single or limited sources for the manufacture and supply of certain product components.\nFor a small percentage of parts, we rely upon a single or limited number of manufacturers and suppliers. Moreover, because we depend on third party manufacturers and suppliers, we do not directly control product delivery schedules or component quality. In addition, we may not be able to maintain satisfactory contractual relations with our manufacturers and suppliers. A significant delay in delivering products to our customers, whether from unforeseen events such as the coronavirus, natural disasters or otherwise, or unforeseen quality issues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we lose any of the manufacturers or suppliers of certain product components, we expect that it would take from three to six months for a new manufacturer or supplier to begin full-scale production of one of our products. The delay and expense associated with qualifying a new manufacturer or supplier and commencing production could result in a material loss of revenue and reduced operating margins and harm our relationships with customers. While we have not experienced any significant supply problems or problems with the quality of the manufacturing process of our suppliers and there have been no materially late deliveries of components or parts to date, it is possible that in the future we may encounter problems in the manufacturing process or shortages in parts, components or other elements vital to the manufacture, production and sale of our products.\nThe loss of existing key management and technical personnel and the inability to attract new hires could have a detrimental effect on the Company.\nOur success depends on identifying, hiring, training, and retaining qualified professionals. Competition for qualified employees in our industry is intense and made more difficult due to the historically tight labor market in Massachusetts, prior to the pandemic. We expect these conditions to remain so for the foreseeable future. If we were unable to attract and hire a sufficient number of employees, or if a significant number of our current employees or any of our senior managers resign, we may be unable to complete or maintain existing projects or bid for new projects of similar scope and revenue. The Company\u2019s success is particularly dependent on the retention of existing management and technical personnel, including Carl H. Guild, Jr., the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Although the Company has entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Guild, the loss or unavailability of his services could impede our ability to effectively manage our operations.\nWe may need to expand our operations and we may not effectively manage any future growth.\nAs of December 11, 2020, we employed 21 full-time and two part-time employees as well as several consultants. In the event our products and services obtain greater market acceptance, we may be required to expand our management team and hire and train additional technical and skilled personnel. We may need to scale up our operations in order to service our customers, which may strain our resources, and we may be unable to manage our growth effectively. If our systems, procedures, and controls are inadequate to support our operations, growth could be delayed or halted, and we could lose our opportunity to gain significant market share. In order to achieve and manage growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our operational and financial management capabilities. Any inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could interfere with the Company\u2019s operations and could compromise the Company\u2019s and its customer\u2019s information, exposing the Company to liability that would cause the Company\u2019s business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including collection of payments from purchasers of our products. The Company also uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes, and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Additionally, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including personally identifiable information of the Company\u2019s employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is material to the Company\u2019s business operations and strategy. Despite security measures, the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the Company\u2019s networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims, liability, and regulatory proceedings and penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, the Company may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of its systems.", "PERMNO": 74836, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "TCCO"}
