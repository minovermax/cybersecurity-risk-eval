Other than statements of historical fact, information regarding activities, events and developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including, but not limited to, information relating to our future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value, are forward-looking statements based on management\u2019s estimates, assumptions and projections. Forward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future economic and financial condition and results of operations, the plans and objectives of management and our assumptions regarding our performance and such plans and objectives. Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cplanned,\u201d \u201cprojected,\u201d \u201cestimated\u201d and \u201cpotential,\u201d among others. Forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are predictions only and actual results could differ materially from management\u2019s expectations due to a variety of factors, including those described below. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such risk factors. The forward-looking statements that we make in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions regarding future events and speak only as of their dates. We assume no obligation to update developments of these risk factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements that we make, or to make corrections to reflect future events or developments, except as required by the federal securities laws.\nIssues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall and/or result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, negatively impacting our operating results.\nIn order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers. Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our Company\u2019s image and reputation. Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. We may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption. In addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages. Costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results.\nIncreases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results.\nWe use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts, almonds, corn sweeteners, natural gas and fuel oil.\nCommodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including:\n\u009f\nCommodity market fluctuations;\n\u009f\nCurrency exchange rates;\n\u009f\nImbalances between supply and demand;\n\u009f\nThe effect of weather on crop yield;\n\u009f\nSpeculative influences;\n\u009f\nTrade agreements among producing and consuming nations;\n\u009f\nSupplier compliance with commitments;\n\u009f\nPolitical unrest in producing countries; and\n\u009f\nChanges in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies.\nAlthough we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs. If we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPrice increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity.\nWe may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption. If we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket demand for new and existing products could decline.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers. Our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:\n\u009f\nEffective retail execution;\n\u009f\nAppropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;\n\u009f\nOur ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;\n\u009f\nOur ability to drive sustainable innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories;\n\u009f\nChanges in product category consumption;\n\u009f\nOur response to consumer demographics and trends, including but not limited to, trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing e-commerce channel; and\n\u009f\nConsumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.\nThere continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively. Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 25% of our total net sales in 2016. McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\nIncreased marketplace competition could hurt our business.\nThe global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues. Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations. We continue to experience increased levels of in-store activity for other snack items, which has pressured confectionery category growth. In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and must continue to introduce and establish new products. Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits. In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment.\nDisruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results.\nApproximately two-thirds of our manufacturing capacity is located in the United States. Disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from, among other factors, the following:\n\u009f\nNatural disaster;\n\u009f\nPandemic outbreak of disease;\n\u009f\nWeather;\n\u009f\nFire or explosion;\n\u009f\nTerrorism or other acts of violence;\n\u009f\nLabor strikes or other labor activities;\n\u009f\nUnavailability of raw or packaging materials; and\n\u009f\nOperational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers.\nWe believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions. We have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur, including our global supply chain strategies and our principle-based global labor relations strategy. If we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur.\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives. The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval. These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring 2016, we successfully completed the SGM integration. However, additional challenges remain, including challenges associated with the macroeconomic environment in China, which could affect our strategy and could have a negative impact on the results of operations and cash flows of our International and Other reportable segment.\nChanges in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment. These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment laws and environmental laws, among others. It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical, economic and/or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors. Volatility in food and energy costs, sustained global recessions, rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.\nChanges in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our Company, our customers and our suppliers. A significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.\nOur international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations.\nIn 2016, we derived approximately 17% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States, compared to 17% in 2015 and 19% in 2014. Additionally, approximately 30% of our total long-lived assets were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2016. As part of our strategy, we have made investments outside of the United States, particularly in China, Malaysia, Mexico and Brazil. As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:\n\u009f\nUnforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand;\n\u009f\nInability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;\n\u009f\nDifficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;\n\u009f\nUnexpected changes in regulatory environments;\n\u009f\nPolitical and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict;\n\u009f\nNationalization of our properties by foreign governments;\n\u009f\nTax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;\n\u009f\nPotentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u009f\nThe imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u009f\nIncreased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;\n\u009f\nThe impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies;\n\u009f\nFailure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; and\n\u009f\nFailure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce.\nIf we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.\nInformation technology is critically important to our business operations. We use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions. These processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others.\nWe invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company\u2019s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings. Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards. We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness. We also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology.\nWhile we believe that our security technology and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks, disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees and those with whom we do business.\nWe might not be able to hire, engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to identify, hire, develop, engage and retain talented personnel across the globe. Competition for global talent is intense, and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business. In particular, if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise, our business performance may be impacted.\nActivities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments.\nIn addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets, channels and categories. This may require significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. If we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not fully realize the expected costs savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe depend on our ability to evolve and grow, and as changes in our business environment occur, we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes. From time to time, we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain long-term sustainable growth, such as the production and supply chain network optimization program we commenced in the second quarter of 2016. These programs are intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency, to reduce our costs and/or to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs, that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs, or that the benefits, even if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations, which could in turn adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 16600, "SIC": 2060, "TIC": "HSY"}
