You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted, and may continue to significantly disrupt, our operations, including our ability to manufacture and supply products and perform research and development activities, our customers\u2019 usage of our products as demand declines in elective surgeries in response to COVID-19, all of which have had and expected to continue to have a material and adverse effect on our business, future revenues and financial condition. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations, financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nOur business, results of operation and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, such as social distancing protocols, and travel restrictions in countries and regions in which we have operations or manufacturing partners. Due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced and may continue to experience significant and unpredictable interruptions in the supply of raw materials, components and sub-assemblies necessary to manufacture and assemble our products and reductions in the demand for our products as healthcare customers continue to divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, our customers may delay, cancel or redirect planned capital expenditures in order to focus resources on COVID-19 or in response to economic disruption related to COVID-19. For example, during the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021, we experienced significant decline in treatment and procedure volume worldwide, as healthcare systems diverted resources to meet the increasing demands of managing COVID-19. In the near term, we expect COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact the use of our products and the number of ophthalmic treatments and procedures performed. If the volume of elective procedures continues to remain lower than normal, our results of operations and financial condition will continue to be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak around the world, we have adopted several measures including allowing employees to work from home, slowing our manufacturing operations, and restricting non-critical business travel by our employees. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption and delays in our ability to operate and manufacture, test and assemble products in our internal facilities, particularly in our Mountain View, California facility, and has limited our ability to continue certain research and development activities which could materially and adversely affect our ability to develop new products and technologies on the timelines we previously anticipated.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets around the world, resulting in an economic downturn that has affected and will likely continue to affect demand for our products and impact our results of operations. As a result, this may lead to a period of regional, national, and global economic slowdown or regional, national, or global recessions that would curtail or delay spending by hospitals and affect demand for our products as well as increase the risk of customer defaults or delays in payments. Our customers may terminate or amend their agreements for the purchase, lease, or service of our products due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures, or other reason. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: the recommendations by medical authorities on whether hospitals should and may perform elective surgical procedures; hospitals abilities and willingness to devote resources to elective surgical procedures; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and workforce pressures); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Although the magnitude of the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations remains uncertain and difficult to predict, and this remains a highly dynamic situation, we have experienced and will continue to experience in subsequent periods, disruptions to our business that will likely continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in our strategic partnership with Topcon and the relationship may divert resources away from existing operations or expose us to liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn March 2, 2021, we entered into a series of strategic transactions with Topcon, Topcon America Corporation (the \u201cInvestor\u201d) and Topcon Medical Laser Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of Topcon ( \u201cTMLS\u201d), which included an asset purchase agreement with the TMLS, pursuant to which we acquired substantially all the assets (except for cash and cash equivalents) of the TMLS, including rights to the PASCAL product (as defined in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d), (ii) Topcon and our company entered into a distribution agreement dated March 2, 2021, pursuant to which we granted Topcon the exclusive right to distribute our retina and glaucoma products in certain geographies outside the United States (the \u201cDistribution Agreement\u201d), (iii) pursuant to an investment agreement dated March 2, 2021 (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d) the Investor acquired 1,618,122 shares of the our Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10 million (the \u201cShares\u201d).\nPursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the transferred assets include substantially all of the TMLS\u2019 assets including the rights to the PASCAL product (the \u201cTransferred Assets\u201d). We assumed only those liabilities arising after the closing in connection with the Transferred Assets. In the Asset Purchase Agreement, our company and the TMLS made certain customary representations and warranties and agreed to certain customary covenants. The Agreement provides that our company and the TMLS will each indemnify the other for losses arising from certain breaches of the Agreement and for certain other liabilities subject to customary caps and deductibles. If there are claims under the indemnification provisions for which we are liable we will need to use some or all our cash to settle those claims.\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we appointed Topcon as the exclusive distributor of our glaucoma and retina products, including PASCAL product, in certain countries outside of the United States. Topcon agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize our products in each region throughout the territory, including achieving certain sales baselines by product category and region. If Topcon fails to achieve the baselines in a region, we will have the right to, subject to payment of a fee, terminate Topcon\u2019s appointment in such region. The Distribution Agreement and Topcon\u2019s appointment will, unless terminated earlier, continue on a country-by-country basis for a period of ten (10) years from the date exclusivity is granted. The Distribution Agreement includes customary termination rights and effects of termination, including a termination for convenience right in favor of Topcon and, subject to payment of a fee, a termination right in our favor upon a change of control of our company.\nAs a result of the Distribution Agreement, we terminated our relationships with our prior distributors in certain geographies and we are using Topcon as our exclusive distributor. If Topcon is unable to generate as much revenue under the Distribution Agreement as we received from our prior distributors, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. If there are claims under the indemnification provisions of the Distribution Agreement for which we are liable, we will need to use some or all our cash to settle those claims or make payments to Topcon pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement.\nWe are investing a substantial amount of time, resources and efforts in connection with our relationship with Topcon, including commercializing our products in certain geographies and working to achieve certain sales baselines by product category and region. All of these actions divert resources away from our other initiatives and operations particularly with respect to product sales in the United States. These efforts may not result in the anticipated additional products, efficiencies or revenues for our company, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition as a result.\nWe face quality control and other production issues that could materially and adversely impact our sales and financial results and the acceptance of our products.\nThe manufacture of our infrared and visible laser consoles and related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process. We may experience manufacturing difficulties, quality control issues or assembly constraints.\nIf our sales increase substantially, we may need to increase our production capacity and may not be able to do so in a timely, effective or cost-efficient manner. We may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products, which may require that we qualify other manufacturers for our products. Furthermore, we may experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations.\nIn the past several years, we have experienced supply chain, production and training issues as we have expanded our product lines and sales volumes, and may experience similar issues in the future as we continue to grow our business. These issues have caused, and may in the future cause, us to reduce or delay the shipment of our products and incur costs to service or replace products already shipped to customers. We have also incurred, and may in the future incur, additional costs to rectify or prevent similar issues in the future. Our efforts to address these supply chain, production and training issues may not be successful, and if we are unable to address these issues in a timely and cost-effective manner, product shipments to our customers could be delayed, our sales levels may suffer and manufacturing and operational costs may increase, any of which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues.\nLaser systems are inherently complex in design and require regular maintenance. The manufacture of our lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process. As a result of the technical complexity of our products, changes in our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. To the extent that we do not achieve such yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected. We provide warranties on certain of our product sales, and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale. The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty. We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs. If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to recognize additional cost of revenues may be required in future periods.\nOur customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects. As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things:\n\u2022\nloss of customers;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of product returns and warranty expenses;\n\u2022\ndamage to our brand reputation;\n\u2022\nfailure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development and engineering resources; and\n\u2022\nlegal actions by our customers.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our direct and independent sales forces and international distributors to sell our products and if we lose our sales force or distributor relationships, it could harm our business.\nOur ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct and independent sales forces within the United States, direct sales force in Germany and relationships with independent international distributors. Currently our direct and independent sales forces within the United States consist of approximately 23 employees and two independent representative, respectively and our direct sales force in Germany consists of one employee. Our international independent distributors are managed by a team of five people. We generally grant our distributors exclusive territories for the sale of our\nproducts in specified countries and regions. The amount and timing of resources dedicated by our distributors to the sales of our products is not within our control. Our international sales are largely dependent on the efforts of these third parties. If any distributor breaches the terms of its distribution agreement with us or fails to generate sales of our products, we may be forced to replace the distributor and our ability to sell our products into that exclusive sales territory could be adversely affected.\nWe do not have any long-term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force. We may be unable to replace our direct sales force personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications, which may harm our revenues and our ability to maintain market share. Similarly, our independent contractor and distributor agreements are generally terminable at will by either party and independent contractors and distributors may terminate their relationships with us, which would affect our sales and results of operations. Any loss of the members of our existing direct or indirect sales organizations, or any failure to execute on our plans to further develop our sales function, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our sales forces\u2019 operations have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as travel is restricted and some services are being performed from home, all of which could have an impact on our ability to sell and distribute our products.\nGrowth in our sales and marketing organization may create operational challenges without immediately offsetting benefits.\nWe have increased and continue to increase our internal sales and marketing functions. This growth may place a significant strain on our management, operating and financial systems and our sales, marketing, training and administrative resources. As a result of our growth, our operating costs may escalate even faster than planned, and some of our internal systems may need to be enhanced or replaced. For example, if we are unable to provide adequate training for our expanding sales force, our ability to fully utilize new sales and marketing resources may be adversely impacted, we could suffer reputational harm and our ability to maintain our installed base of customers may be negatively impacted. If we cannot effectively manage our expanding operations and our costs, we may not be able to grow effectively or we may grow at a slower pace, and our business could be adversely affected.\nIt can take six months or longer before our internal sales representatives are fully trained and productive in selling our product to prospective clients. This ramp up period presents a number of operational challenges as the cost of recruiting, hiring and carrying new sales representatives cannot be offset by the revenue such new sales representatives produce until after they complete their ramp up periods. If we cannot reliably develop our sales representatives to a productive level, or if we lose productive representatives in whom we have heavily invested, our future growth rates and revenue may suffer.\nWe depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, a large portion of our revenues from international sales. For the fiscal year 2021, our international sales were $28.3 million, or 52.6% of total revenues. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. All of our international revenues and costs for the fiscal year 2021 have been denominated in U.S. dollars except for sales transacted through our German subsidiary. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies makes our U.S. dollar-denominated products more expensive and thus less competitive in foreign markets and may negatively affect our reported revenue in any particular reporting period. Our international operations and sales are subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:\n\u2022\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and financial markets;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nproduct and production issues;\n\u2022\nperformance of our international channel of distributors;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection periods;\n\u2022\nimpact of recessions in global economies and availability of credit;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nchange in international regulatory agreements and requirements;\n\u2022\ntrade sanctions and embargoes;\n\u2022\nimpact of international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest;\n\u2022\nforeign certification requirements, including continued ability to use the CE mark in Europe, and other local regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndiffering local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022\ncultural differences;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign medical reimbursement and coverage policies and programs;\n\u2022\nreduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the United States;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations;\n\u2022\nprotectionist, adverse and changing foreign governmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ngreater risk of our employees failing to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including anti-trust regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and any trade regulations designed to ensure fair trade practices; and\n\u2022\ncompliance costs and risks of non-compliance with multiple regulatory regimes governing the production, marketing, sale and use of our products.\nAny one or more of these factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs we expand our existing international operations, we may encounter new risks in addition to the above factors. For example, as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions, we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies. If we are not successful in developing these relationships, we may not be able to grow sales in these geographic regions. These or other similar risks could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and the price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to develop and successfully introduce new products and applications or fail to improve our existing products, our business prospects and operating results may suffer.\nOur ability to generate incremental revenue growth will depend, in part, on the successful outcome of research and development activities, which may include clinical trials that lead to the development of new products and new applications using our products. Our research and development process is expensive, prolonged, and entails considerable uncertainty. Due to the complexities and uncertainties associated with ophthalmic research and development, products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required to market such products successfully. In addition, our research and development process has been delayed due to the impact of COVID-19, and should COVID-19 economic restrictions worsen, it could delay and disrupt our research and development processes even further.\nSuccessful commercialization of new products and new applications will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and effectively coordinate with our suppliers. In addition, we must successfully sell and achieve market acceptance of new products and applications and enhanced versions of existing products. The extent of, and rate at which, market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables, which include, among other things, price, safety, efficacy, reliability, marketing and sales efforts, the development of new applications for these products, the availability of third-party reimbursement of procedures using our new products, the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns.\nOur ability to market and sell new products is subject to government regulation, including approval or clearance by the FDA and foreign government agencies. Any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and would cause our net revenues to decline.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic slowdowns and related uncertainties.\nWe are subject to macro-economic fluctuations in the U.S. and worldwide economy including inflationary pressures that may cause the cost of manufacturing our products or servicing our products to increase. Concerns about consumer and investor confidence, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending, international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and pandemic illness could reduce customer orders or cause customer order cancellations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to cause adverse impacts on global economic activity which could negatively impact our business. In addition, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts, such as that occurring in Russia and Ukraine, and terrorist acts may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and abroad.\nWeak economic conditions and declines in consumer spending and consumption may harm our operating results. Purchases of our products are often discretionary. During uncertain economic times, customers or potential customers may delay, reduce or forego their purchases of our products and services, which may impact our business in a number of ways, including lower prices for our products and services and reducing or delaying sales. There could be a number of follow-on\neffects from economic uncertainty on our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays, delays in customer payments of outstanding accounts receivable and/or customer insolvencies, counterparty failures negatively impacting our operations, and increasing expense or inability to obtain future financing.\nIf economic uncertainty persisted, or if the economy entered a prolonged period of decelerating growth, our results of operations may be harmed.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nOur sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future. Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors contributing to these fluctuations include the following:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic uncertainties, inflationary pressures and political concerns, including the impact of COVID-19 and the war between Russia and Ukraine;\n\u2022\nchanges in the prices at which we can sell our products, including the impact of changes in exchange rates;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products, product enhancements and new applications by our competitors, including new drugs, entry of new competitors into our markets, pricing pressures and other competitive factors;\n\u2022\nany delays or reductions in product shipments, or product recalls, resulting from manufacturing, distribution or other operational issues;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products, product enhancements and new applications;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for our existing line of ophthalmology products;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of components and subassemblies, including the willingness and ability of our sole or limited source suppliers to timely deliver components at the times and prices that we have planned;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain sales volumes at a level sufficient to cover fixed manufacturing and operating costs;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our product mix within ophthalmology products and foreign and domestic sales;\n\u2022\nthe effect of regulatory approvals and changes in domestic and foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nour long and highly variable sales cycle;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 or potential customers\u2019 budgets as a result of, among other things, reimbursement policies of government programs and private insurers for treatments that use our products;\n\u2022\nvariances in shipment volumes as a result of product, supply chain due to global constraints or other factors and training issues; and\n\u2022\nincreased product innovation costs.\nIn addition to these factors, our quarterly results have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by seasonal factors. For example, our European sales during the third quarter are generally lower due to many businesses being closed for the summer vacation season.\nOur expense levels are based, in part, on expected future sales. If sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall of sales, and our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, we have historically made a significant portion of each quarter\u2019s product shipments near the end of the quarter. If that pattern continues, any delays in shipment of products could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for such quarters. Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our past operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance. Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below expectations, which would likely cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nWe rely on continued market acceptance of our existing products and any decline in sales of our existing products would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe currently market visible and infrared medical laser systems and delivery devices to the ophthalmology market. We believe that continued and increased sales, if any, of these medical laser systems is dependent upon a number of factors including the following:\n\u2022\nthe impact of COVID-19 pandemic on timing of ophthalmic treatment procedures;\n\u2022\nacceptance of product performance, features, ease of use, scalability and durability, including with respect to our MicroPulse laser photocoagulation systems and our PASCAL product;\n\u2022\nrecommendations and opinions by ophthalmologists, other clinicians, and their associated opinion leaders;\n\u2022\nmarketing and clinical study outcomes;\n\u2022\nprice of our products and prices of competing products and technologies, particularly in light of the current macro-economic environment where healthcare systems and healthcare operators are becoming increasingly price sensitive;\n\u2022\navailability of competing products, technologies and alternative treatments; and\n\u2022\nlevel of reimbursement for treatments administered with our products.\nIn addition, we derive a meaningful portion of our sales in the form of recurring revenues from selling consumable instrumentation, including our probe for the Cyclo G6 Laser and EndoProbe devices. Our ability to increase recurring revenues from the sale of consumable products will depend primarily upon the features of our current products and product innovation, the quality of, ease of use and prices of our products, including the relationship to prices of competing products. The level of our service revenues will depend on the quality of service we provide and the responsiveness and the willingness of our customers to use our products and services rather than purchase competing products or services. Any significant decline in market acceptance of our products or services or our revenues associated therewith may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face strong competition in our markets and expect the level of competition to grow in the foreseeable future.\nCompetition in the market for laser systems and delivery devices used for ophthalmic treatment procedures is intense and is expected to increase. This market is also characterized by technological innovation and change. We compete by providing features and services that are valued by our customers such as: enhanced product performance and clinical outcomes, ease of use, durability, versatility, customer training services and rapid repair of equipment.\nOur principal ophthalmic laser competitors are Alcon, Inc., Novartis AG, Bausch Health Companies Inc., Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Ellex Medical Lasers, Ltd., Lumenis Ltd., Nidek Co. Ltd., Quantel Medical SA, OD-OS GmbH and A.R.C. Laser GmbH. We also compete with alternative glaucoma surgical device companies such as Alcon, Inc., Allergan, Inc., Glaukos Corporation, New World Medical, Inc. and Ivantis, Inc. Pharmaceuticals represent alternative treatments to our laser procedures. Some of our principal pharmaceutical competitors are Alcon, Inc., Allergan, Inc., Astellas Pharma Inc., Pfizer Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche Holdings Ltd. (Genentech) and Bausch Health Companies Inc. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, engineering, product development, manufacturing, marketing and technical resources than we do. Some companies also have greater name recognition than us and long-standing customer relationships. In addition, other medical device companies, academic and research institutions, or others, may develop new technologies or therapies, including medical devices, surgical procedures or pharmacological treatments and obtain regulatory approval for products utilizing such techniques that are more effective in treating the conditions targeted by us, or are less expensive than our current or future products. Our technologies and products could be rendered obsolete by such developments. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by uncertainty regarding healthcare reform measures and changes in third-party coverage and reimbursement policies.\nOur products are typically purchased by doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users, which bill various third-party payers, such as governmental programs and private insurance plans, for the health care services provided to their patients. Changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third-party payers\u2019 policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products may prohibit adequate reimbursement. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies. Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding reimbursement of medical procedures using our products and any healthcare reform measures. Further proposed legislation, regulation and policy changes affecting third-party reimbursement are likely. Among other things, Congress has in the past proposed changes to and the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the \u201cAffordable Care Act,\u201d and the current U.S. presidential administration has announced certain policy changes that could impact the availability of benefits under the Affordable Care Act. For example, tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017 eliminated the tax penalty for individuals who did not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 (the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d). We anticipate continued Congressional interest in modifying provisions of the Affordable Care Act. At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to or any repeal of the Affordable Care Act, with respect to certain of its provisions or in its entirety or related administrative policies. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level.\nWe are unable to predict what legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future at the state or federal level, or what effect such legislation or\nregulation may have on us. Furthermore, existing legislation and regulation related to the health care industry and third-party coverage reimbursement, including the Affordable Care Act, has been subject to judicial challenge, and may be subject to similar challenges from time to time in the future (such as the California v. Texas case). Denial of coverage and reimbursement of our products, or the revocation or changes to coverage and reimbursement policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird-party payers are increasingly scrutinizing and continue to challenge the coverage of new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products. Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third-party payers. While we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed, payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used, was investigational or was not cost-effective.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare laws, we could face substantial penalties and financial exposure, and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWhile we do not bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, because payment is in many cases available for our products from such payors, many healthcare laws place limitations and requirements on the manner in which we conduct our business (including our sales and promotional activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and facilities) and could result in liability and exposure for us. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include (i) the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, (ii) federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us if we provide coding and billing advice to customers, or under theories of \u201cimplied certification\u201d where the government and qui tam relators may allege that device companies are liable where a product that was paid for by the government in whole or in part was promoted \u201coff-label,\u201d lacked necessary clearance or approval, or failed to comply with good manufacturing practices or other laws; (iii) transparency laws and related reporting and disclosures requirements such as the federal Sunshine Act, now known as Open Payments; and/or (iv) state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, including, without limitation anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from their federal counterparts in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that their provisions are open to a variety of evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. Compliance with Open Payments, commonly known as the Sunshine Act, has presented a number of challenges to companies such as ours, in terms of interpretation of the law and its implementation. Under the Sunshine Act, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) has the potential to impose penalties of up to $1.15 million per year for violations, depending on the circumstances, although enforcement has been negligible to date. Payments reported under the Sunshine Act also have the potential to draw scrutiny on payments to and relationships with physicians, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute and other healthcare laws. The risk that we may be found in violation of these laws may be increased by the fact that we do not have a formal healthcare compliance program in place. Further, while safe harbors may in some instances be available and utilized by companies to reduce risks associated with the Anti-Kickback Statute and certain other healthcare laws, we have not necessarily utilized such safe harbors nor fully followed all elements required to claim the benefit of such safe harbors in all possible instances. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nWe depend on collaborative relationships to develop, introduce and market new products, product enhancements and new applications.\nWe depend on both clinical and commercial collaborative relationships. We have entered into collaborative relationships with academic medical centers and physicians in connection with the research and innovation and clinical testing of our products. Commercially, we currently have a distribution and licensing agreement with Alcon for our GreenTip SoftTip Cannula. Sales of and royalties from the GreenTip SoftTip Cannula are dependent upon the sales performance of Alcon, which depends on their efforts and is beyond our control. The failure to obtain any additional future clinical or commercial collaborations and the resulting failure or success of such collaboration relationships could have a material adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we cannot increase our sales volumes, reduce our costs or introduce higher margin products to offset potential reductions in the average unit price of our products, our operating results may suffer.\nThe average unit price of our products may decrease in the future in response to changes in product mix, competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by our competitors or other factors. If we are unable to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or through new product introductions, our net revenues will decline. In addition, to maintain our gross margins we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products. If we cannot maintain our gross margins our business could be seriously harmed, particularly if the average selling price of our products decreases significantly without a corresponding increase in sales.\nOur promotional practices are subject to extensive government scrutiny. We may be subject to governmental, regulatory and other legal proceedings relative to advertising, promotion and marketing that could have a significant negative effect on our business.\nWe are subject to governmental oversight and associated civil and criminal enforcement relating to drug and medical device advertising, promotion, and marketing, and such enforcement is evolving and intensifying. In the United States, we are subject to potential enforcement from the FDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Other parties, including private plaintiffs, also are commonly bringing suit against pharmaceutical and medical device companies, alleging off-label marketing and other violations. We may be subject to liability based on the actions of individual employees and contractors carrying out activities on our behalf, including sales representatives who may interact with healthcare professionals.\nIf we fail to manage growth effectively, our business could be disrupted which could harm our operating results.\nWe have experienced and may in the future experience growth in our business, both organically and through the acquisition of businesses and products. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments to enable our future growth through, among other things, new product innovation and clinical trials for new applications and products. We must also be prepared to expand our work force and to train, motivate and manage additional employees as the need for additional personnel arises. Our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. Any failure to effectively manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our intellectual property and business.\nOur success and ability to compete is dependent, in part, upon our proprietary information. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business. As of January 1, 2022, our patent portfolio includes 57 active United States patents and 95 active foreign patents on the technologies related to our products and processes. In addition, as of January 2, 2021, we have 11 patent applications pending in the United States and 24 foreign patent applications pending. Our patent applications may not be approved. Any patents granted now or in the future may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and development by our competitors of competing products. Moreover, our competitors, many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products either in the United States or in international markets. Patents have a limited lifetime and once a patent expires competition may increase.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how which we seek to protect, in part, through proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. Our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain industry standard provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us, without additional consideration, any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us, subject to customary exceptions. Proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and others may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Also, our trade secrets may become known to or independently developed by competitors.\nThe laser and medical device industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage.\nNumerous patents are held by others, including academic institutions and our competitors. Patent applications filed in the United States generally will be published eighteen months after the filing date. However, since patent applications continue to be maintained in secrecy for at least some period of time, both within the United States and internationally, we cannot provide assurance that our technology does not infringe any patents or patent applications held by third parties. We have, from time to time, been notified of, or have otherwise been made aware of, claims that we may be infringing upon patents or other proprietary intellectual property owned by others. If it appears necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under such patents or proprietary intellectual property. Although patent holders commonly offer such licenses, licenses under such patents or intellectual property may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be reasonable.\nAny claims, with or without merit, and regardless of whether we are successful on the merits, would be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause shipment delays or require us to develop non-infringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding and failure to obtain necessary licenses or develop alternate technologies could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully, our ability to manage our business could be impaired.\nOur future success depends upon the continued service of our key management, technical, sales, and other critical personnel. Our officers and other key personnel are employees-at-will, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain them. Key personnel have left our company in the past, and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future. The loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, and the results of our operations. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry and the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as other geographic markets in which we recruit, is intense and characterized by increasing salaries, which may increase our operating expenses or hinder our ability to recruit qualified candidates. In addition, the integration of replacement personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful.\nEfforts to acquire additional companies or product lines may divert our managerial resources away from our business operations, and if we complete additional acquisitions, we may incur or assume additional liabilities or experience integration problems.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we seek to acquire businesses or product lines for various reasons, including adding new products, adding new customers, increasing penetration with existing customers, adding new manufacturing capabilities or expanding into new geographic markets. Our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financings. These efforts could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. If we complete future acquisitions, we may also experience:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating any acquired products into our existing business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating an acquired company\u2019s technologies, services, employees, customers, partners, business operations and administrative and software management systems with ours;\n\u2022\ndelays in realizing the benefits of the acquired products;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nadverse customer reaction to the product acquisition; and\n\u2022\nincreases in expenses.\nMoreover, we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. In connection with these types of transactions, we may issue additional equity securities that would dilute the ownership interest of existing investors or earnings per share, use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business, incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay, incur large charges or substantial liabilities, encounter difficulties integrating diverse business cultures and become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges. These challenges related to acquisitions or investments could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast demand for our product and component requirements for the manufacture of our product, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays and may experience lost sales or significant inventory carrying costs.\nWe use quarterly and annual forecasts based primarily on our anticipated product orders to plan our manufacturing efforts and determine our requirements for components and materials. It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our product and the lead times required to obtain or manufacture the necessary components, materials, and fully assembled products. Lead times for components and fully assembled products vary significantly and depend on numerous factors, including the specific supplier, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for such products. If we overestimate the demand for our product, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate demand for our product and consequently, our components, materials and fully assembled products requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt our manufacturing, delay delivery of our product to our customers and result in the loss of customer sales. Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results.\nWe depend on sole source or limited source suppliers.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products, including optics, laser diodes and crystals. We have some long term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers and currently purchase components and fully-assembled products on a purchase order basis. Some of our suppliers and manufacturers are sole or limited source suppliers. In addition, some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies whose operations may be disrupted or discontinued at any time. There are risks associated with the use of independent manufacturers, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe impact of COVID-19 on global supply chains and market stability;\n\u2022\nunavailability of shortages or limitations on the ability to obtain supplies of components and products in the quantities that we require, or that satisfy the environmental requirements to which we are subject;\n\u2022\ndelays in delivery or failure of suppliers to deliver critical components and products on the dates we require;\n\u2022\nfailure of suppliers to manufacture and assemble components and products to our specifications, and potentially reduced quality; and\n\u2022\ninability to obtain components and products in a timely manner or at acceptable prices due to global supply chain constraints or other factors.\nOur business and operating results may suffer from the lack of alternative sources of supply for critical sole and limited source components and fully-assembled products. The process of qualifying suppliers is complex, requires extensive testing with our products, and may be lengthy, particularly as new products are introduced. New suppliers would have to be educated in our production processes. In addition, the use of alternate components may require design alterations to our products and additional product testing under FDA and relevant foreign regulatory agency guidelines, which may delay sales and increase product costs. Any failures by our vendors to adequately supply limited and sole source components or products may impair our ability to offer our existing products, delay the submission of new products for regulatory approval and market introduction, materially harm our business and financial condition and cause our stock price to decline. Establishing our own capabilities to manufacture these components or products would be expensive and could significantly decrease our profit margins. Our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to obtain components or fully-assembled products in the quantity and quality desired and at the prices we have budgeted.\nIf our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed.\nOur facilities could be subject to catastrophic loss such as fire, flood, unpredictable power outages, or earthquake. All of our research and development activities, manufacturing, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in Mountain View, California. California can experience earthquakes, catastrophic wildfires, and intermittent power outages. Any such loss at any of our facilities caused by fires, flooding, power outages, or earthquakes could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expense to repair and replace our facilities.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or breaches of data security, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on information technology systems to keep financial records and corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties and operate other critical functions, including sales and manufacturing processes. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to disruption due to breakdown or malicious intrusion and computer viruses. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in our information technology systems, it could negatively impact the coordination of our sales, planning and manufacturing activities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, to maximize our information technology efficiency, we have physically consolidated our primary corporate data and computer operations. This concentration, however, exposes us to a greater risk of disruption to our internal information technology systems. Although we maintain offsite back-ups of our data, if operations at our facilities were disrupted, it may cause a material disruption in our business if we are not capable of restoring function on an acceptable time frame.\nIn addition, our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks or other data security breaches-whether by employees or others-which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property or could lead to the public exposure of sensitive and confidential information of our employees, customers, suppliers and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we have implemented a number of protective measures, including firewalls, antivirus and malware detection tools, patches, log monitors, routine back-ups, system audits, routine password modifications and disaster recovery procedures, such measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent or fully address the adverse effect of such events, and in some cases, we may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. If we are unable to prevent such security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above.\nIf we fail to maintain our relationships with health care providers, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline. At the same time, relationships with these individuals and entities are the subject of heightened scrutiny and may present the potential for healthcare compliance risks.\nWe market our products to numerous health care providers, including physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, government affiliated groups and group purchasing organizations. We have developed and strive to maintain close relationships with members of each of these groups who assist in product research and development and advise us on how to satisfy the full range of surgeon and patient needs. We rely on these groups to recommend our products to their patients and to other members of their organizations. The failure of our existing products and any new products we may introduce to retain the support of these various groups could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our interactions, communications, and financial relationships with these individuals and entities present potential healthcare compliance risks.\nWe are subject to government regulations which may cause us to delay or withdraw the introduction of new products or new applications for our products.\nThe medical devices that we market and manufacture are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by foreign and state governments. Under the FD&C Act and the related regulations, the FDA regulates the design, development, clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, sale, distribution and promotion of medical devices. Before a new device can be introduced into the market, the product must be shown to meet regulatory requirements established by the FD&C Act and implemented by the FDA. Unless otherwise exempt, a device manufacturer must obtain marketing \u201cclearance\u201d through the 510(k) premarket notification process, or \u201capproval\u201d through the lengthier premarket approval application (\u201cPMA\u201d) process. Not all devices are eligible for the 510(k) clearance process. Depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the device and the nature of the disease or disorder to be treated, the PMA process can take several years, require extensive clinical testing and result in significant expenditures. Even if regulatory clearance or approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown safety issues may result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Other countries also have extensive regulations regarding clinical trials and testing prior to new product introductions. Our failure to obtain government approvals or any delays in receipt of such approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe FDA imposes a broad range of additional requirements on medical device companies. Our products must be produced in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d) and our manufacturing facilities are subject to establishment registration and device listing requirements from the FDA, and similar requirements from certain state authorities, and ongoing periodic inspections by the FDA, including unannounced inspections for compliance with applicable requirements. We are subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting obligations for medical device adverse events and malfunctions; notification of our products\u2019 defects or failure to comply with the FDA\u2019s laser regulations; and reporting of recalls, corrections, or removals of our products. The FDA also imposes requirements for the labeling of our products, and places limitations on claims we are permitted to make about our products in promotional labeling. The Federal Trade\nCommission has jurisdiction over the advertising of all our products, which are non-restricted devices, and exercises oversight in coordination with the FDA.\nNoncompliance with the applicable requirements can result in, among other things, regulatory citations (including \u201c483 Observations\u201d) and Warning Letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute. Any of these actions by the FDA would materially and adversely affect our ability to continue operating our business and the results of our operations. Such enforcement action can also result in negative publicity.\nIn addition, we are also subject to varying product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. As a result of our sales in Europe, we are required to have all medical device products \u201cCE\u201d marked, an international symbol affixed to all our medical device products demonstrating compliance with the European Medical Device Directives and/or Medical Device Regulations (\u201cMDR\u201d) and all applicable standards. While currently all our released medical device products are CE marked, continued certification is based on the successful review of our quality system by our European Registrar during their periodic audits. Any loss of certification would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There are several major regulatory changes occurring in the regulation of medical devices in the EU. The revision of the quality system regulation (ISO 13485:2016) has been released that substantially increased the requirements for a medical device quality system. The MDR has replaced the medical device directives (93/42/EEC), and it substantially changes the way that medical devices are brought to market in the EU and how they maintain compliance throughout the product\u2019s life cycle. Due to the UK\u2019s exit from EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d), different rules will apply in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), Northern Ireland and the EU after the Brexit transition period, which began January 1, 2021. Similarly, Switzerland has changed its relationship with the EU and in May 2022, will require medical device manufacturers such as Iridex to contract with a Swiss Authorized Representative. Additionally, the new revision 4 of the clinical evaluation report guidance document (MEDDEV 2.7.1) severely restricts the use of substantial equivalence for new products, resulting in the need for formal clinical trial data for most many products. These changes will increase the cost for compliance and for product development, and they lengthen product introduction cycles. Failure to comply with these changes can have an adverse effect on our ability to release new products in a timely manner.\nAny clinical trials necessary that we may undertake for regulatory approval or marketing reasons will be an expensive, lengthy, costly, and uncertain process, and could result in delays in new product introductions or even an inability to release a product.\nWe may be required to undertake clinical trials often required to obtain regulatory approvals or may choose to undertake such trials for marketing or other reasons. Clinical trials for products such as ours are complex and expensive and their outcomes are uncertain. Any clinical trials that we may undertake would require the investment of significant financial and administrative resources. Moreover, the results of clinical trials are uncertain, and inconclusive or negative results may not support, or may impair, the sale and adoption of our products. We may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials showed promising results. Any of our products could produce undesirable side effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate. We, the FDA, or another regulatory authority could suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if they or we believed the trial participants faced unacceptable health risks.\nIf we fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulation and laser performance standards, our manufacturing operations could be halted, and our business would suffer.\nWe are currently required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s QSR. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. Because our products involve the use of lasers, our products also are covered by a performance standard for lasers set forth in FDA regulations. The laser performance standard imposes specific record-keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements. These requirements include affixing warning labels to laser products, as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products. The FDA enforces the QSR and laser performance standards through periodic unannounced inspections. We have been, and anticipate in the future being, subject to such inspections. Our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection or our failure to comply with applicable laser performance standards could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations, a recall of our products, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, which would cause our sales and business to suffer.\nIf we modify one of our FDA cleared devices, we may need to submit a new 510(k), or potentially a PMA, and if clearance or approval is not obtained, it would prevent us from selling our modified products or cause us to redesign our products.\nAny modifications to an FDA-cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our existing products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our revenues and future profitability. We have made modifications to our devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees, and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our products.\nOur products may be misused, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nWe market and sell our products for use by highly skilled physicians with specialized training and experience in the treatment of eye-related disorders. We, and our distributors, generally offer but do not require purchasers or operators of our products to attend training sessions, nor do we supervise the procedures performed with our products. The physicians who operate our products are responsible for their use and the treatment regime for each individual patient. In addition, non-physicians, particularly in countries outside of the United States, or poorly trained or inexperienced physicians, may make use of our products. Our efforts to market our MicroPulse systems as a fovea-friendly alternative to traditional continuous wavelength systems or alternative treatment methods may result in users failing to implement adequate safety precautions and thereby increase the risks associated with the misuse of our product. The lack of training and the purchase and use of our products by non-physicians or poorly trained or inexperienced physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation, or otherwise cause our business to suffer.\nInability of customers to obtain credit or material increases in interest rates may harm our sales.\nSome of our products are sold to health care providers in general practice. Many of these health care providers purchase our products with funds they secure through various financing arrangements with third-party financial institutions, including credit facilities and short-term loans. If availability of credit becomes more limited, or interest rates increase, these financing arrangements may be harder to obtain or become more expensive for our customers, which may decrease demand for our products. Any reduction in the sales of our products would cause our business to suffer.\nOur products could be subject to recalls even after receiving FDA approval or clearance. A recall would harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we market and sell our products have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of our products, or in other cases we may determine that we will recall a product because we have determined that the product is violative, in order to avoid further enforcement action and protect the public health.\nA government mandated recall, or a voluntary recall by us, could occur as a result of actual or potential component failures, adverse event reports, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Furthermore, we may from time to time initiate a recall of a component or set of components comprising a portion of our laser systems, which could increase customer returns, warranty claims and associated reserve levels. A recall could divert management\u2019s attention, cause us to incur significant expenses, harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our future sales and financial results.\nFor example, on February 23, 2018, we initiated a worldwide voluntary recall of a specific laser accessory called the TruFocus LIO Premiere\u00ae (\u201cLIO\u201d). The LIO is a head-mounted indirect ophthalmoscope that connects to our laser console and is used to view and perform laser treatment on a patient\u2019s retina. This recall was prompted after we received reports of three adverse events from one physician in the United States, resulting in focal cataracts and iris burns occurring during procedures in which the TruFocus LIO Premiere was used. We identified several potential root causes for the adverse events, including use error. On March 22, 2019, we provided the FDA with a request for termination of Recall Number Z-1075-2018. We submitted a follow up request for termination on September 29, 2021. Our termination request is pending.\nWe obtained FDA clearance for an updated TruFocus LIO Premiere\u00ae device. The updated device includes expanded user instructions and minor design changes. Use of the updated LIO may result in adverse events, including those observed with the prior LIO device. If physician use of our updated LIO results in serious adverse events, we may have to initiate another recall or utilize additional resources to further evaluate the design of the LIO device. Furthermore, in light of the recall, we cannot provide any assurance that the updated LIO, will achieve market acceptance. We will be required to devote significant resources to launch and market the updated LIO and cannot provide any assurance that these activities will generate revenue as anticipated. If our revenue grows more slowly than we expect because of a delay in or a lack of market acceptance for our updated LIO, our business and financials will be adversely affected.\nIf product liability claims are successfully asserted against us, we may incur substantial liabilities that may adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims from time to time. Our products are highly complex and the risk of significant patient injury is more likely with products and procedures involving the eye. Use of our products incorrectly can result in temporary or permanent loss in vision, burns, scarring, blind spots or other injuries of the eye and we may periodically become subject to product liability lawsuits as a result. We believe we maintain adequate levels of product liability insurance to cover such claims subject to certain deductibles. However, product liability insurance is expensive and we might not be able to obtain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us, if at all. A successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant developments resulting from recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies could have a material adverse effect on us.\nCertain of our materials may be subject to the effects of various trade agreements, treaties and tariffs. The prior U.S. presidential administration has imposed tariffs on various goods from various countries, including China, Canada and the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). As a result, Canada, the EU, China and other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs on certain United States exports. We cannot predict the effect these and potential additional tariffs will have on our business, including in the context of escalating trade tensions. Further tariffs, additional taxes, or trade barriers, both domestically and internationally, may affect our selling and/or manufacturing costs and margins, the competitiveness of our products, or our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, and consequently affect our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States increase the price of, or limit the amount of, raw materials and finished goods imported into the United States, the costs of our raw materials may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, these potential developments and any market perceptions concerning these and related issues and the attendant regulatory uncertainty regarding, for example, the posture of governments with respect to international trade, could have a material adverse effect on global trade and economic growth which, in turn can adversely affect our business. Furthermore, changes in United States trade policy have resulted and could result in additional reactions from United States trading partners and other countries, including adopting responsive trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. We sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside the United States and we purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside the United States. These measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the United States or may cause us to adjust our worldwide supply chain. Any of these effects could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, may result in lowering our margin on products sold.\nWe cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impacts on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the United States economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\nThe comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted in the United States on December 22, 2017 and includes, among other items, a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, certain interest expense deduction limitations and changes in the timing of certain taxable income. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d) which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. We have completed our analysis and accounting with respect the Tax Act, and identified no additional changes from amounts previously recorded. However, changes in law, interpretations, and facts may result in adjustments to these amounts. Based on our net operating loss carryovers and valuation allowance, there is no impact to its consolidated financial statements as a result of the accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act.\nSubsequent legislations, guidance, regulations or audits that differ from our prior assumptions and interpretations, or other factors which were not anticipated at the time we estimated our tax provision could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing our business practices which, if violated, could result in substantial penalties. Additionally, challenges to or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to and thus could harm our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires us to track and disclose the source of certain metals used in manufacturing which may stem from minerals (so called \u201cconflict minerals\u201d) which originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining regions. These metals include tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. These metals are central to the technology industry and are present in some of our products as component parts. In most cases no acceptable alternative material exists which has the necessary properties. It is not possible to determine the source of the metals by analysis but instead a good faith description of the source of the intermediate components and raw materials must be obtained. The components which incorporate those metals may originate from many sources and we purchase fabricated products from manufacturers who may have a long and difficult-to-trace supply chain. As the spot price of these materials varies, producers of the metal intermediates can be expected to change the mix of sources used, and components and assemblies which we buy may have a mix of sources as their origin. We are required to carry out a diligent effort to determine and disclose the source of these materials. There can be no assurance we can obtain this information from intermediate producers not willing or not able to provide this information or further identify their sources of supply or to notify us if these sources change. These metals are subject to price fluctuations and shortages which can affect our ability to obtain the manufactured materials we rely on at favorable terms or from consistent sources. These changes could have an adverse impact on our ability to manufacture and market our devices and products.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and future sales and issuances of securities could negatively affect our stock price and dilute the ownership interest of our existing investors.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. We may need in the future to raise additional funds through future equity or debt financings to meet our operational needs and capital requirements for product development, clinical trials and commercialization and may subsequently require additional fundraising. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could seriously harm our business and operating results. Future sales or issuances of securities by us could decrease the value of our common stock, dilute stockholders\u2019 voting power and reduce future potential earnings per share.\nTo raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity-linked securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell additional equity securities, our existing stockholders may be materially diluted. Additionally, new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. We may also issue debt securities, which may impose restrictive covenants on our operations or otherwise adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders.\nWe may sell shares or other securities in any offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by existing investors, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by existing investors.\nDivestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and require us to raise additional capital to replace revenue from those business units or product lines.\nWe evaluate the performance and strategic fit of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business. In addition, divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, and the loss of revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may need to raise additional capital to replace the revenue generated from the business or product line that is divested and we can provide no assurance that such capital will be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line, and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may also result in a diversion of management attention, operational difficulties and losses.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental requirements, our business, financial condition, operating results and reputation could be adversely affected.\nOur products and operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, storage, handling, exposure to, and disposal of hazardous materials and a large and growing body of international standards which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate compliance to these with the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit the ability to market our products in those regions which require compliance with such standards or subject us to fines and penalties. Examples of such standards include laws governing the hazardous material content of our devices and products, such as the EU Directive 2015/863 which is known as \u201cRoHS 3\u201d and that relates to Restrictions on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances and the EU Directive 2012/19/EU on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in several other jurisdictions and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States, and we are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations.\nOur failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our devices and products, inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business and financial condition. We also expect that our devices and products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. New environmental laws and regulations will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our devices and products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, quarterly variations in our operating results, announcements by us or our competitors of new products or of significant clinical achievements, changes in market valuations of other similar companies in our industry and general market conditions, including deteriorating market conditions due to investor concerns regarding inflation and hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the trading price of our common stock fluctuated from a low of $5.62 per share to a high of $9.37 per share. During the fiscal year 2021, the trading price of our common stock fluctuated from a low of $2.18 per share to a high of $9.37 per share. There can be no assurance that our common stock trading price will not suffer declines. Our common stock may experience an imbalance between supply and demand resulting from low trading volumes and therefore broad market fluctuations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock regardless of our performance.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe expect to retain any earnings for use to further develop our business, and do not expect to declare cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of any such dividends in the future depends upon our earnings, financial condition, capital needs and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors, and may be restricted by future agreements with lenders. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our market and our competitors. If no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOwnership of our common stock is concentrated among a few investors, which may affect the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. Substantial sales by such investors could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur directors, executive officers, current five percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant portion of our common stock outstanding. Having such a concentration of ownership may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding common stock or control of our board of directors through a proxy solicitation.\nAs a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner, particularly if material weaknesses or significant deficiencies were to persist. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 while we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act. If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which could likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, that our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline.\nOur charter documents, anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, and contractual provisions could delay or prevent an acquisition or sale of our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation empowers the board of directors to establish and issue a class of preferred stock, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of the preferred stock. These provisions give the board of directors the ability to deter, discourage or make more difficult a change in control of our company, even if such a change in control could be deemed in the interest of our stockholders or if such a change in control would provide our stockholders with a substantial premium for their shares over the then-prevailing market price for the common stock. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nonly our board of directors is authorized to fill vacant directorships, including newly created seats;\n\u2022\nspecial meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of the board, chief executive officer or president, thus prohibiting a stockholder from calling a special meeting;\n\u2022\nstockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose other business; and\n\u2022\nstockholders are not permitted to cumulate votes in the election of directors.\nIn addition, we are generally subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock or prevent changes in our management.", "PERMNO": 83145, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "IRIX"}
