RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our equity or debt securities.\nOur business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices and other factors beyond our control.\nOur business depends heavily on the level of oil and gas exploration, development and production and demand for drilling services in offshore areas worldwide. Demand for our drilling services is vulnerable to declines that are typically associated with depressed oil and natural gas prices. Even the perceived risk of a decline in oil or natural gas prices may cause oil and gas companies to reduce their spending, in which case demand for our drilling services could decrease and our drilling revenues may be adversely affected by lower rig utilization and/or day rates. Oil and natural gas prices have historically been very volatile, and our drilling operations have in the past suffered through long periods of weak market conditions. As a result of the significant decline in oil\nand gas prices over the last half of 2014, many oil and gas operators have announced significant reductions in their capital expenditure budgets for 2015 and beyond, which we expect will, in turn, reduce the demand and day rates for offshore drilling units worldwide.\nDemand for our drilling services also depends on additional factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nworldwide demand for and prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe supply of drilling units in the worldwide fleet versus demand;\n\u2022\nthe level of exploration and development expenditures by energy companies;\n\u2022\nthe willingness and ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to limit production levels and influence prices;\n\u2022\nthe level of production in non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nthe effect of economic sanctions that affect the energy industry;\n\u2022\nthe general economy, including inflation;\n\u2022\nthe condition of global capital markets;\n\u2022\nadverse sea, weather and climate conditions in our principal operating areas, including possible disruption of exploration and development activities due to loop currents, hurricanes and other severe sea and weather conditions;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding future energy prices;\n\u2022\nenvironmental and other laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npolicies of various governments regarding exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nnationalization and/or confiscation;\n\u2022\nworldwide tax policies;\n\u2022\npolitical and military conflicts in oil-producing areas and the effects of terrorism;\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration and development technology such as unconventional drilling and the development of shale resources;\n\u2022\nthe development and exploitation of alternative fuels and energy sources;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of our customer base, and\n\u2022\nconsolidation of our competitors.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to secure contracts for our drilling units at sufficient day rates. In addition to depressed oil and gas prices, an oversupply of drilling units may lead to a reduction in rig utilization and day rates and, therefore, may materially impact our profitability.\nOur ability to meet our cash flow obligations will depend on our ability to secure ongoing work for our drilling units at sufficient day rates. As of February 19, 2015, we had 12 drilling units with contract terms ending in 2015, and 4 drilling units with contract terms ending in 2016. We cannot predict the future level of demand or day rates for our drilling units or future conditions in the oil and gas industry. Failure to secure profitable contracts for our drilling units could negatively impact our operating results and financial position, impair our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our capital expenditures and/or meet our other obligations.\nThe supply of existing and future drilling units has increased significantly due to heightened construction of new offshore drilling units during the last few years. According to industry sources, there were 545 jack-ups and 119 drillships in the worldwide fleets as of February 16, 2015, and an additional 132 jack-ups and 57 drillships were under construction or on order. This significant increase in construction activity has resulted in an oversupply of drilling units, which in turn, has caused a subsequent decline in utilization and day rates, which decline is expected to continue for an extended period of time. This overcapacity, combined with the decline in oil and gas prices and reductions in capital expenditure budgets by oil and gas operators, is expected to intensify competition and result in lower day rates and/or inability to contract our drilling units. Lower utilization and day rates could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nA further decline in the market for contract drilling services could result in additional asset impairment charges.\nIn 2014, we recognized asset impairment charges aggregating $566 million (or approximately 7% of our total assets) on our twelve oldest jack-up rigs. Prolonged periods of low utilization and day rates could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges on our drilling units if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. See \u201cImpairment of Long-lived Assets\u201d in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding impairment charges recognized in 2013 and 2014.\nWe are subject to operating risks that could result in environmental damage, property loss, personal injury, death, business interruptions and other losses.\nOur drilling operations are subject to many operational hazards such as blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, punch-throughs (i.e., when one leg of a jack-up rig breaks through the hard crust of the ocean floor, placing stress on the other legs), mechanical or technological failures, navigation errors, or equipment defects that could increase the likelihood of accidents. Accidents can result in:\n\u2022\nserious damage to or destruction of property and equipment;\n\u2022\npersonal injury or death;\n\u2022\ncostly delays or cancellations of drilling operations;\n\u2022\ninterruption or cessation of day rate revenue;\n\u2022\nuncompensated downtime;\n\u2022\nreduced day rates;\n\u2022\nsignificant impairment of producing wells, leased properties, pipelines or underground geological formations;\n\u2022\ndamage to fisheries and pollution of the marine and coastal environment; and\n\u2022\nfines and penalties.\nOur drilling operations are also subject to marine hazards, whether at drilling sites or while equipment is under tow, such as a vessel capsizing, sinking, colliding or grounding. In addition, raising and lowering jack-up rigs and drilling into high-pressure formations are complex, hazardous activities, and we periodically encounter problems. Any ongoing change in weather or sea patterns or climate conditions could increase the adverse impact of marine hazards.\nIn past years, we have experienced some of the types of incidents described above, including high-pressure drilling accidents resulting in lost or damaged formations and punch-throughs and towing accidents resulting in lost or damaged equipment. Any future such events could result in operating losses and have a significant impact on our business.\nThe global nature of our operations involves additional risks, particularly in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nIn recent years, we have significantly diversified our operations internationally. Foreign operations are often subject to additional political, economic and other uncertainties, such as with respect to taxation policies, customs restrictions, local content requirements, currency exchange and repatriation risk, security threats including terrorism, piracy and the risk of asset expropriation. Political unrest and regulatory restrictions in our areas of operations could potentially delay current or planned projects or could impact us in other unforeseen ways.\nMany countries have regulations or policies currently in effect requiring or rewarding the participation of local companies and individuals in the petroleum related activities. Such participation requirements can include, without limitation, the ownership of\noil and gas concessions, the hiring of local agents and partners, the procurement of goods and services from local sources, and the employment of local workers. The requirements can also include ownership of our drilling units, in whole or in part, by domestic companies or citizens and /or require reflagging of our drilling units under the flag of the country. The governments of many of these foreign countries have become increasingly active in requiring higher levels of local participation which may increase our costs and risks of operating in these regions, thereby limiting our ability to enter into, relocate from, or compete in these regions.\nIn addition, our inability to obtain visas and work permits for our employees in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis could delay or interrupt our operations resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Further, governmental restrictions in some jurisdictions may make it difficult for us to move our personnel, assets and operations in and out of these regions without delays or downtime.\nIn foreign areas where legal protections may be less available to us, we assume greater risk that our customer may terminate contracts without cause on short notice, contractually or by governmental action. Additionally, operations in certain areas, such as the North Sea, are highly regulated and have higher compliance and operating costs in general.\nIn order to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, we generally require customer payments to be in U.S. dollars and try to limit non-U.S. currency holdings to the extent they are needed to pay liabilities denominated in local currencies. In certain countries in which we operate, local laws or contracts may require us to receive payment in the local currency. In such instances, we may be exposed to devaluation and other risk of exchange loss. In the event we terminate operations in such countries we may not be able to utilize or convert such funds to another currency for future use. In 2014 we terminated operations in Egypt, where we hold approximately $15.2 million in Egyptian pounds, based on exchange rates in effect at January 31, 2015. We can provide no assurance we will be able to convert, utilize or repatriate such funds in the future.\nThe offshore drilling industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.\nOur drilling markets are highly competitive with numerous participants, none of which has a dominant market share. Some of our competitors may have greater financial or other resources than we do. Drilling contracts are often awarded on a competitive-bid basis, and intense price competition is frequently the primary factor determining which qualified contractor is awarded the job. In addition, historically there have been periods of high demand and short supply of rigs and high day rates, followed by periods of low demand, excess rig supply and low day rates. The current worldwide fleet overcapacity and anticipated delivery of a significant number of newbuilds over the next five years will further increase the supply of rigs and intensify competition and pressure day rates. We may be unable to secure profitable contracts for our drilling units, have to reduce our day rates, or enter into nontraditional fee arrangements, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nWe will experience reduced profitability if our customers terminate or seek to renegotiate our drilling contracts, and our backlog of contracts may not be ultimately realized.\nMost of our term drilling contracts are cancelable by the customer without penalty upon the occurrence of events beyond our control such as the loss or destruction of the rig, or the suspension of drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment, and require the customer to pay a termination fee in the event of a cancelation without cause. Not all of our contracts require the customer to make an early termination payment upon cancellation. Early termination payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract, and could result in the rig becoming idle for an extended period of time. During periods of depressed market conditions, we are subject to the increased risk of our customers seeking to terminate their contracts, including through claims of non-performance, or to renegotiate the terms, including day rates and payment options, of existing contracts.\nIn addition, our drilling contracts subject us to counterparty risks. The ability of our counterparties to perform their obligations under a contract depend on a number of factors beyond our control, including among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the offshore drilling industry, market prices for oil and gas, the overall financial condition of the counterparty, the day rates received and the level of profitability necessary to maintain drilling activities. In addition, in a depressed market, our customers may no longer need a drilling rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable drilling unit at a lower day rate. If we or our customers are unable to perform under existing contracts for any reason or replace terminated contracts with new contracts under less favorable terms, our backlog of estimated revenues from drilling contracts would decline and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to build, maintain, and upgrade our drilling fleet.\nOur business is capital intensive and dependent on having sufficient cash flow and or available sources of financing in order to fund our capital expenditure requirements. We can provide no assurance that we will have access to adequate or economical sources of capital to fund our capital expenditures.\nConstruction upgrades, enhancements, conversions, mobilizations and repairs of rigs and drillships are subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have one remaining ultra-deepwater drillship under construction at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd.'s shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea scheduled for delivery in late March 2015. Although there is certain insurance coverage and financial and bank guarantees associated with the drillship construction contract, in the event Hyundai is, for any reason, unable to perform under its agreement, there may be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFrom time to time in the future, we may also undertake additional new construction projects. In addition, we may make significant upgrade, refurbishment and repair expenditures for our fleet from time to time, particularly as our drilling units age.\nInitial operations of new drilling units and mobilization of existing units often result in delays and other complications that could result in significant unexpected costs, uncompensated downtime, reduced day rates or the cancellation or termination of drilling contracts.\nSome of the costs associated with construction projects, upgrades, enhancements, conversions, mobilizations and repairs of drilling units could be unplanned and are subject to risks of cost overruns or delays as a result of numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nshipyard unavailability;\n\u2022\nshortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor for completion of repairs or upgrades to our equipment; unscheduled delays in the delivery or cost increases of materials and equipment or in shipyard construction;\n\u2022\nfailure of equipment to meet, design, quality or performance standards;\n\u2022\nloss of or damage to essential equipment while in transit;\n\u2022\nfinancial or operating difficulties experienced by equipment vendors or the shipyard;\n\u2022\nunanticipated actual or purported change orders;\n\u2022\nlocal customs strikes or related work slowdowns that could delay importation of equipment or materials;\n\u2022\nengineering problems, including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment;\n\u2022\ndesign or engineering changes;\n\u2022\nlatent damages or deterioration to the hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\nclient acceptance delays;\n\u2022\nweather interference, storm damage or other events of force majeure;\n\u2022\ndisputes with shipyards and suppliers;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of shipyards and suppliers to honor warranty obligations;\n\u2022\nlong lead-times for replacement of equipment;\n\u2022\nshipyard failures and difficulties;\n\u2022\nfailure of third-party equipment vendors or service providers;\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increases, including relating to raw materials used in construction of our drilling units; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals or in meeting permit or approval conditions.\nThese factors may contribute to cost variations and delays in the delivery of our ultra-deepwater newbuild drillship or upgrade projects. Delays in the delivery of the drillship or other drilling units or the inability to complete construction in accordance with their design specifications may, in some circumstances, result in a delay in contract commencement, resulting in a loss of revenue\nto us, and may also cause customers to renegotiate, terminate or shorten the term of a drilling contract pursuant to applicable late delivery clauses. In the event of termination of one of these contracts, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms or at all. Additionally, capital expenditures for upgrades, refurbishment and construction projects could materially exceed our planned capital expenditures. Moreover, our drilling units that may undergo upgrade, refurbishment or repair may not earn a day rate during the periods they are out of service. In addition, in the event of a shipyard failure or other difficulty, we may be unable to enforce certain provisions under our newbuild contracts such as our contractual rights to recover amounts paid as installments under such contracts. Furthermore, the inability or unwillingness of shipyards and suppliers to honor warranty obligations may result in additional costs to us. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe have and will likely continue to have certain customer concentrations, and the loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOne customer, Saudi Aramco, accounted for 24% of our 2014 consolidated revenues. The loss or material reduction of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, to the extent that we may be heavily dependent on any single customer, we could be subject to the risks faced by that customer to the extent that such risks impede the customer's ability to continue operating and make timely payments to us. In addition, due to the high day rate and long-term of our drillship contracts, a loss of any of our drillship customers may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we or our customers are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for drilling operations, we may be forced to suspend or cease our operations, and our profitability may be reduced.\nCrude oil and natural gas exploration and production operations require numerous permits and approvals for us and our customers from governmental agencies in the areas in which we operate. In addition, many governmental agencies have increased regulatory oversight and permitting requirements in recent years. If we or our customers are not able to obtain necessary permits and approvals in a timely manner, our operations will be adversely affected. Obtaining all necessary permits and approvals may necessitate substantial expenditures to comply with the requirements of these permits and approvals, future changes to these permits or approvals, or any adverse change in the interpretation of existing permits and approvals. In addition, such regulatory requirements and restrictions could also delay or curtail our operations, require us to make substantial expenditures to meet compliance requirements, and could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations and may create a risk of expensive delays or loss of value if a project is unable to function as planned.\nFor example, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), have implemented significant environmental and safety regulations applicable to drilling operations in the US GOM. These regulations have at times adversely impacted the ability of our customers to obtain necessary permits and approval on a timely basis and/or to continue operations uninterrupted under existing permits.\nIncreases in regulatory requirements could significantly increase our costs or delay our operations.\nMany aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulation, including equipping and operating vessels, drilling practices and methods, and taxation. Operations in certain areas, such as the US GOM and the North Sea, are highly regulated and have higher compliance and operating costs in general. We may be required to make significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or new governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that such laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or result in a reduction of revenues associated with downtime required to implement regulatory requirements.\nIn the aftermath of the Macondo well blowout in 2010 and the subsequent investigation into the causes of the event, new rules were implemented for oil and gas operations in the US GOM and in many of the international locations in which we operate, including new standards for well design, casing and cementing and well control procedures, as well as rules requiring operators to systematically identify risks and establish safeguards against those risks through a comprehensive safety and environmental management system, or SEMS. New regulations continue to be implemented, including rules regarding drilling systems and equipment, such as blowout preventer and well-control systems and lifesaving systems, as well as rules regarding employee training, engaging personnel in safety management and requiring third-party audits of SEMS programs. Such new regulations may require modifications or enhancements to existing systems and equipment, or require new equipment, and could increase our operating costs and cause downtime for our units if we are required to take any of them out of service between scheduled surveys or inspections, or if we are required to extend scheduled surveys or inspections to meet any such new requirements. Additional\ngovernmental regulations concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of our operations and could reduce exploration activity in the areas in which we operate.\nGovernments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas, and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. These governmental regulations may limit or substantially increase the cost of drilling activity in an operating area generally. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities.\nGovernments around the world are beginning to adopt laws and regulations regarding climate change. Lawmakers and regulators in the U.S., the U.K. and other jurisdictions where we operate have focused increasingly on restricting and reporting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse\u201d gases that may contribute to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. This may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers and our customers. We may be exposed to risks related to new laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements pertaining to climate change, greenhouse gases, carbon emissions or energy use that could decrease the use of oil or natural gas, thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel and our drilling services. Governments may also pass laws or regulations incentivizing or mandating the use of alternative energy sources such as wind power and solar energy, which may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and our drilling services. Such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have a negative impact on our business, and could adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities.\nIn addition, the offshore drilling industry is highly dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas industry and accordingly, regulations of the production and transportation of oil and gas generally could impact demand for our services.\nOur drilling units are subject to damage or destruction by severe weather, and our drilling operations may be affected by severe weather conditions.\nOur drilling rigs are located in areas that frequently experience hurricanes and other forms of severe weather conditions. These conditions can cause damage or destruction to our drilling units. Further, high winds and turbulent seas can cause us to suspend operations on drilling units for significant periods of time. Even if our drilling units are not damaged or lost due to severe weather, we may experience disruptions in our operations due to evacuations, reduced ability to transport personnel to the drilling unit, or damage to our customers\u2019 platforms and other related facilities. Additionally our customers may choose not to contract our rigs for use during hurricane season, particularly in the US GOM. Future severe weather could result in the loss or damage to our rigs or curtailment of our operations, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are currently self-insured with respect to physical damage due to named windstorms in the US GOM.\nHurricanes (or named windstorms) have caused tremendous damage to drilling and production equipment and facilities throughout the US GOM in recent years, and insurance companies have incurred substantial losses as a result. Accordingly, insurance companies have substantially reduced the levels of available coverage for named windstorms in the US GOM and have dramatically increased the price of such coverage. Coverage for potential liabilities to third parties associated with property damage and personal injuries, as well as coverage for environmental liabilities and removal of wreckage and debris associated with these named windstorm losses, has also been limited.\nAs a result of the increased cost and reduced availability, we do not maintain named windstorm physical damage coverage on any of our rigs located in the US GOM. Our coverage for liabilities (including removal of wreck) arising out of a US GOM named windstorm are subject to a self-insured retention of $200 million per occurrence. Losses due to future US GOM named windstorms not covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTaxing authorities may challenge our tax positions, and we may not be able to realize expected benefits.\nOur tax positions are subject to audit by relevant tax authorities who may disagree with our interpretations or assessments of the effects of tax laws, treaties, or regulations, or their applicability to our corporate structure or certain of our transactions we have undertaken. We could therefore incur material amounts of unrecorded income tax cost if our positions are challenged and we are unsuccessful in defending them.\nChanges in or non-compliance with tax laws and changes to our income tax estimates could adversely impact our financial results.\nIn 2012, we changed our legal domicile to the U.K. There are frequently legislative proposals in the U.S. that attempt to treat companies that have undertaken similar transactions as U.S. corporations subject to U.S. taxes or to limit the tax deductions or tax credits available to U.S. subsidiaries of these corporations. The realization of the expected tax benefits of our redomestication could be impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other tax authorities. Changes in our effective tax rates as determined from time to time, the inability to realize anticipated tax benefits, or the imposition of additional taxes could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ultimate repatriation of earnings from RCI\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries to RCI, or by changes in applicable regulations and accounting principles.\nChanges in our recorded tax estimates (including estimated reserves for uncertain tax positions) may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We do not provide for deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of our non-U.K. subsidiaries, including RCI\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries. It is our policy and intention to permanently reinvest earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of RCI outside the U.S. Should the non-U.S. subsidiaries of RCI make a distribution from these earnings, we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes.\nPolitical disturbances, war, or terrorist attacks and changes in global trade policies and economic sanctions could adversely impact our operations.\nOur operations are subject to political and economic risks and uncertainties, including instability resulting from civil unrest, political demonstrations, mass strikes, or an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in oil or natural gas producing areas, which may result in extended business interruptions, suspended operations and danger to our employees, or result in claims by our customers of a force majeure situation and payment disputes. Additionally, we are subject to risks of terrorism, piracy, political instability, hostilities, expropriation, confiscation or deprivation of our assets or military action impacting our operations, assets or financial performance in many of our areas of operations.\nMost of our contracts are fixed-price contracts, and changes in customer requirements, increased regulatory requirements and increases in our operating costs or price levels in general could have an adverse effect on the profitability of those contracts.\nMost of our drilling contracts provide for the payment of a fixed day rate during periods of operation and reduced day rates during periods of other activities. Our long-term contracts may be at day rates lower than current prevailing rates, and therefore unable to benefit from the higher prevailing rates. Long-term contracts may also be at day rates higher than prevailing rates, and our revenues may decline at the end of such favorable contracts. Many of our operating costs are unpredictable and can vary based on events beyond our control, including increased customer and regulatory requirements, and increased labor and other costs. Operators and regulators are requiring higher standards than in the past, including more robust back-up redundancy systems. Our margins will therefore vary over the terms of our contracts as a result of applicable day rates and operating costs. If our costs increase or we encounter unforeseen costs, we may not be able to recover them from our customers, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur rig operating and maintenance costs include fixed costs that will not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and day rates.\nWe do not expect our rig operating and maintenance costs to decline proportionately when rigs are not in service or when day rates decline. Fixed costs continue to accrue during out-of-service periods (such as shipyard stays and rig mobilizations preceding a contract), which represented approximately 10% of our available rig days in 2014 and 2013. Operating revenue may fluctuate as a function of changes in day rates, but costs for operating a rig are generally fixed or only slightly variable regardless of the day rate being earned. Additionally, if our rigs are idle between contracts, we typically continue to incur operating and personnel costs because the crew is used to prepare the rig for its next contract. During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be immediate as portions of the crew may be required to prepare our rigs for stacking. Moreover, as our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs may increase significantly.\nShortages of significant parts or equipment, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs, decrease our revenues and adversely impact our operations.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, parts, components and sub-systems used in our drilling operations exposes us to volatility in the quality, prices and availability of such items, as well as poor customer service in general. Certain high specification parts and equipment we use in our operations may be available only from a single or small number of suppliers. A disruption in the deliveries from such third-party suppliers, capacity constraints, production\ndisruptions, price increases, defects or quality-control issues, recalls or other decreased availability or servicing of parts and equipment could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers, adversely impact our operations and revenues by resulting in uncompensated downtime, reduced day rates or the cancellation or termination of contracts, or increase our operating costs.\nSome of our operating risks may not be covered by insurance.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for damage to our drilling rigs, third-party liability, workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability, sudden and accidental pollution, reservoir damage and other damages and losses. Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and self-insured retentions which must be met prior to any recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and we can provide no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from potential consequences and damages. A significant event which is not adequately covered by insurance and /or the failure of one or more of our insurance providers to meet claim obligations or losses or liabilities resulting from uninsured or underinsured events could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur current insurance policies provide coverage for loss or damage to our fleet of drilling rigs on an agreed value basis (which varies by unit) subject to a deductible of $25 million per occurrence. This coverage does not include damage arising from a US GOM named windstorm, for which we are self-insured.\nWe maintain insurance policies providing coverage for liability associated with negative environmental impacts of a sudden and accidental pollution event, third-party liability, employers\u2019 liability (including Jones Act liability), automobile liability and aviation liability, and these policies are subject to various deductibles and underlying limits. In addition, we maintain excess liability coverage with an annual aggregate limit of $700 million subject to a self-insured retention of $10 million except in cases of liabilities (including removal of wreck) arising out of US GOM named windstorms, which are subject to a self-insured retention of $200 million per occurrence.\nOur rig physical damage and liability insurance renews each June. We can provide no assurance we will be able to secure coverage of a similar nature with similar limits at comparable costs.\nOur contractual indemnification provisions may not be sufficient to cover our liabilities.\nOur drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification and allocation of liabilities between our customers and us with respect to liabilities resulting from various hazards associated with the drilling industry, such as loss of well control, well-bore pollution and damage to subsurface reservoirs and injury or death to personnel. The degree of indemnification we receive from operators against liabilities varies from contract to contract based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated. Our drilling contracts generally indemnify us for injuries and death of our customers\u2019 employees and loss or damage to our customers\u2019 property. Our service agreements generally indemnify us for injuries and death of our service providers\u2019 employees. However, the enforceability of our indemnities may be subject to differing interpretations, or further limited or prohibited under applicable law or by contract, particularly in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, punitive damages or punitive fines and/or penalties. For example, in 2012 a U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana invalidated certain contractual indemnities for punitive damages and for civil penalties in a drilling contract governed by U.S. maritime law as a matter of public policy. We could therefore be liable for certain liabilities even in cases where we have contractual indemnification rights. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us or will otherwise honor their contractual indemnity obligations. The failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations, or losses or liabilities resulting from events excluded from or unenforceable under contractual indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to obtain and retain highly skilled personnel could hurt our operations.\nWe require highly skilled personnel to operate our rigs and provide technical services and support for our business in each of the areas of our operations. To the extent that demand for drilling services and the size of the worldwide industry fleet increase (including due to the impact of newly constructed rigs), shortages of qualified personnel could arise, creating upward pressure on wages and difficulty in staffing and servicing our rigs, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the entrance of new participants into the offshore drilling market would cause further competition for qualified and experienced personnel as these entities seek to hire personnel with expertise in the offshore drilling industry. The heightened competition for skilled personnel could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows by limiting our operations or further increasing our costs.\nWe are involved in litigation and legal proceedings from time to time that could have a negative effect on us if determined adversely.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings, which may include, among other things, contract dispute, personal injury, environmental, toxic tort, employment, tax and securities litigation, governmental investigations or proceedings, and litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. Although we intend to defend any of these matters vigorously, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter. Our profitability may be adversely affected by the outcome of claims or contract disputes, including any inability to collect receivables or resolve significant contractual or day rate disputes, and any purported nullification, cancellation or breach of contracts with customers or other parties. Litigation may have an adverse effect on us because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated with defending the lawsuits, the diversion of resources, reputational damage, and other factors.\nA downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs.\nWe currently have investment grade credit ratings, which are subject to review and change by the rating agencies from time to time. There can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency. If ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted. Tightening in the credit markets and the reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets due to turmoil in the financial and banking industries could also affect our access to the debt capital markets or the price we pay to issue debt. Our revolving credit facility includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded. Further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.\nWe have entered into intercompany loan agreements that could affect our business, financial position, and ability to enter into financial transactions, including the payment of dividends.\nIn connection with our restructuring, Rowan plc and its subsidiaries have entered into intercompany debt arrangements which contain negative covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nCreate liens\n\u2022\nIncur other indebtedness or guarantee other indebtedness\n\u2022\nMake dividends or other distributions of cash or property\n\u2022\nRepurchase or redeem shares\n\u2022\nMake investments\n\u2022\nChange the nature of our business or operations\n\u2022\nRedeem indebtedness\n\u2022\nMerge or consolidate or enter into transactions with affiliates\n\u2022\nSell assets including capital shares of subsidiaries\n\u2022\nEnter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries\nThe agreements also contain affirmative covenants such as mandatory prepayments upon consolidated excess cash balances or material dispositions and other customary events of default, including a cross-default upon the acceleration due to default of any other debt in a principal amount in excess of one million dollars. In addition, debtor subsidiaries are required to maintain adequate total equity and adequate debt-to-equity ratios as identified in each such agreement.\nIf an event of default has occurred and is continuing and has not been cured or waived by the lending subsidiary, then the payment of any intercompany indebtedness could be accelerated, and such payment could have an adverse impact on our ability to pay dividends or make other capital allocations.\nWe depend heavily upon the security and reliability of our technology systems and those of our service providers, and such systems are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.\nWe depend heavily on technologies, systems and networks that we manage, and others that are managed by our third-party service and equipment providers, to conduct our business and operations. Cybersecurity risks and threats to such systems continue to grow in sophisticated ways that avoid detection and may be difficult to anticipate, prevent or mitigate. If any of our or our service or equipment providers\u2019 security systems for protecting against cybersecurity breaches or failures prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by having our business and financial systems compromised, our companies\u2019, employees\u2019, vendors\u2019 or customers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or our (or our customers\u2019) business operations or safety\nprocedures disrupted, degraded or damaged. A breach or failure could also result in injury (financial or otherwise) to people, loss of control of, or damage to, our (or our customers\u2019) assets, harm to the environment, reputational damage, breaches of laws or regulations, litigation and other legal liabilities. In addition, we may incur significant costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity risks or events and to defend against any investigations, litigation or other proceedings that may follow such events. Such a failure or breach of our systems could adversely and materially impact our business operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnology disputes could negatively impact our operations or increase our costs.\nDrilling rigs use proprietary technology and equipment which can involve potential infringement of a third party\u2019s rights, including patent rights. The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our jack-ups and drillships are owned by us or our suppliers or sub-suppliers, however, in the event that we or one of our suppliers or sub-suppliers becomes involved in a dispute over infringement rights relating to equipment owned or used by us, we may lose access to repair services or replacement parts, or we could be required to cease use of some equipment or forced to modify our jack-ups or drillships. We could also be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment. Technology disputes involving us or our suppliers or sub-suppliers could adversely affect our financial results and operations.\nTransocean holds U.S. and other patents for dual activity drilling equipment and has pursued litigation against several other offshore drilling contractors. Transocean could choose to sue us or our customers for infringing its patents if it believes that we are using technology covered by its patent on our drillships, and we could be forced to modify our drillships and/or pay royalties to Transocean in the event that a Court were to find that any Transocean patents are infringed.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws could result in fines, criminal penalties and drilling contract terminations and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (UK Bribery Act) and similar laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operated and may in the future operate in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Any failure to comply with the FCPA, UK Bribery Act, or other anti-corruption laws due to our own acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of others, including our partners, agents or vendors, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participation in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling units or other assets.\nUnionization efforts and labor regulations in certain countries in which we operate could materially increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nCertain of our employees and contractors in international markets, such as Trinidad, Norway and Angola, are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiation. Further, efforts may be made from time to time to unionize other portions of our workforce. In addition, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, strikes or work stoppages and other labor disruptions. Additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our costs, reduce our revenues or limit our operations.\nThe enforcement of civil liabilities against Rowan plc may be more difficult.\nBecause Rowan plc is a public limited company incorporated under English law, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against Rowan plc in U.S. courts than would be the case for U.S. judgments obtained against a U.S. company. In addition, it may be more difficult to bring some types of claims against Rowan plc in courts in the U.K. than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.\nOur articles of association include mandatory offer provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing hostile takeovers, including those that might result in a premium being paid over the market price of our shares, and discouraging, delaying or preventing changes in control or management.\nAlthough Rowan plc is not currently subject to the U.K. Takeover Code, certain provisions similar to the mandatory offer provisions and certain other aspects of the U.K. Takeover Code are included in our articles of association. As a result, among other matters, except with the consent of our Board or the prior approval of the shareholders, a Rowan plc shareholder, together with persons acting in concert, would be at risk of certain Board sanctions if they acquired 30 percent or more of our issued shares without\nmaking an offer to all of our other shareholders that is in cash or accompanied by a cash alternative. The ability of shareholders to retain their shares upon completion of a mandatory offer may depend on whether the offeror subsequently causes us to propose a court-approved scheme of arrangement that would compel minority shareholders to transfer or surrender their shares in favor of the offeror or, if the offeror has acquired at least 90 percent of the relevant shares, the offeror requires minority shareholders to accept the offer under the \u2018squeeze-out\u2019 provisions in our articles of association. The mandatory offer provisions in our articles of association could have the effect of discouraging the acquisition and holding of interests of 30 percent or more of issued shares and encouraging those shareholders who may be acting in concert with respect to the acquisition of shares to seek to obtain the consent of our Board before effecting any additional purchases. In addition, these provisions may adversely affect the market price of our shares or inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares that could otherwise result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.\nAs a result of increased shareholder approval requirements, we may have less flexibility as a U.K. public limited company than as a Delaware corporation with respect to certain aspects of capital management.\nUnder Delaware law, directors may issue, without further stockholder approval, any shares authorized in a company\u2019s certificate of incorporation that are not already issued or reserved. Delaware law also provides substantial flexibility in establishing the terms of preferred shares. However, English law provides that a board of directors may generally only allot shares with the prior authorization of shareholders; such authorization must state the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted and may only be for a maximum period of five years.\nEnglish law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash while Delaware law does not. However, it is possible for the articles of association, or shareholders in a general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights for a maximum period of up to five years from the date of adoption of the exclusion.\nEnglish law also generally prohibits us from repurchasing our shares on the open market, and prohibits us from repurchasing our shares by way of \u201coff-market purchases\u201d without the prior approval of shareholders by special resolution (i.e., 75 percent of votes cast), which approval lasts for a maximum period of five years.\nPrior to the redomestication, resolutions were adopted to authorize the allotment of a certain amount of shares, exclude certain preemptive rights and permit off market purchases, in each case without further shareholder approval, but these authorizations will expire in 2017 unless further approved by our shareholders prior to the expiration date.\nWe cannot assure you that situations will not arise where U.K. shareholder approval requirements for the extension or expansion of any of these actions would deprive our shareholders of substantial capital management benefits.\nWe have incurred higher costs as a result of the redomestication and we expect to continue to do so.\nThe redomestication has resulted in an increase in some of our ongoing expenses and increased compliance costs with regulatory requirements. Some costs, including those related to financial reporting requirements and governance, such as holding management, board and shareholder meetings in the U.K., are higher than would be the case if we had remained a U.S. company. Additionally, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur higher professional fees and other costs to comply with U.K. corporate securities and tax laws.", "PERMNO": 45495, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "RDC"}
