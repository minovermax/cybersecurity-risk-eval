RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and general economic conditions.\nChanges in economic conditions could cause the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements to change rapidly, resulting in material future adjustments in asset values, the allowance for loan losses, or capital that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity.\nThe previous economic downturn elevated unemployment levels and negatively impacted consumer confidence. It also had a detrimental impact on industry-wide performance nationally as well as the Company\u2019s market areas. Since 2013, improvement in several economic indicators have been noted, including increasing consumer confidence levels, increased economic activity and a continued decline in unemployment levels.\nPast market conditions have also led to the failure or merger of a number of prominent financial institutions. Financial institution failures or near-failures can result in further losses as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them and defaults under contracts entered into with such entities as counterparties. Furthermore, declining asset values, defaults on mortgages and consumer loans, and the lack of market and investor confidence, as well as other factors, can all combine to increase credit default swap spreads, to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings, and to otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability of liquidity, despite very significant declines in Federal Reserve borrowing rates and other government actions. In the previous economic downturn, some banks and other lenders suffered significant losses and became reluctant to lend, even on a secured basis, due to the increased risk of default and the impact of declining asset values on the value of collateral. The foregoing can significantly weaken the strength and liquidity of some financial institutions worldwide.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the states where we operate, and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor confidence and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nThe business environment in the states where we operate could deteriorate and adversely affect the credit quality of our loans and our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that business and economic conditions will remain stable in the near term. If financial market volatility worsens, or if there are more disruptions in the financial markets, including disruptions to the United States or international banking systems, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could adversely affect our profitability.\nChanges in the credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve, could significantly impact our financial performance. For instance, changes in the nature of open market transactions in U.S. government securities, the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings, and reserve requirements against bank deposits, could lead to increases in the costs associated with our business. In addition, such changes could influence the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits. If the interest rates we pay on deposits increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments, then our net interest income could be adversely affected. Due to the changing conditions in the national economy, we cannot predict with certainty how future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, and loan demand will impact our business and profitability.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other benchmark rates are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.\nCertain of our LIBOR-based financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, hedging products, debt obligations, investments, and loans, extend beyond 2021. We are in the process of assessing the impact that a cessation or market replacement of LIBOR would have on these various products and contracts. We also continue to monitor the transition relief being considered by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) concerning the accounting for contract modifications and hedge accounting.\nFinancial legislative and regulatory initiatives could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, supervision, legislation, and control. For instance, in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010, as well as several programs that have been initiated by the U.S. Treasury, the FRB, and the FDIC. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation\u201d included herein for more information regarding regulatory burden and supervision.\nSome of the provisions of legislation and regulation that have adversely impacted the Company include the \u201cDurbin Amendment\u201d to the Dodd-Frank Act, which mandates a limit to debit card interchange fees, and Regulation E amendments to the EFTA regarding overdraft fees. Future financial legislation and regulatory initiatives can limit the type of products we offer, the methods by which we offer them, and the prices at which they are offered. These provisions can also increase our costs in offering these products.\nThe CFPB, Federal Reserve, and Arkansas State Bank Department have broad rulemaking, supervisory and examination authority, as well as data collection and enforcement powers. The scope and impact of the regulators\u2019 actions can significantly impact the operations of the Company and the financial services industry in general.\nThese laws, regulations, and changes can increase our costs of regulatory compliance. They also can significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability. The ultimate impact of the provisions in legislative and regulatory initiatives on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations also depends upon regulatory interpretation and rulemaking. As a result, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of future legislation or regulation, including the extent to which it could increase costs or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumers may not use community banks to meet their financial needs.\nAdvancements in technology have created the ability for financial transactions that have historically often involved community banks to be conducted through alternative channels. For example, consumers can now hold funds in brokerage accounts and Internet-only banks, or indeed with essentially any bank that provides for online account opening and online banking. Consumers can also complete transactions such as the purchase or sale of goods and services, the payment of bills, and the transfer of funds without the direct assistance of banks. The resulting increased competition could result in the loss of fee income and customer deposits, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. It could also require additional, costly investments in technology to remain competitive.\nWe are subject to fraud risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFraud is a major, and increasing, operational risk, particularly for financial institutions. We continue to experience fraud attempts and losses through, for example, deposit fraud (such as wire fraud and check fraud) and loan fraud. Fraud may also arise from the misconduct of our employees. The methods used to perpetrate and combat fraud continue to evolve, particularly as advances in technology occur. While we seek to be vigilant in the prevention, detection, and remediation of fraud events, some fraud loss is unavoidable, and the risk of major fraud loss cannot be eliminated.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur concentration of banking activities in Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas, including our real estate loan portfolio, makes us more vulnerable to adverse conditions in the particular local markets in which we operate.\nOur subsidiary bank operates primarily within the states of Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas, where the majority of the buildings and properties securing our loans and the businesses of our customers are located. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes in the economic conditions in these eight states, the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, and the value of the collateral securing such loans. We largely depend on the continued growth and stability of the communities we serve for our continued success. Declines in the economies of these communities or the states in general could adversely affect our ability to generate new loans or to receive repayments of existing loans, and our ability to attract new deposits, thus adversely affecting our net income, profitability and financial condition.\nThe ability of our borrowers to repay their loans could also be adversely impacted by the significant changes in market conditions in the region or by changes in local real estate markets, including deflationary effects on collateral value caused by property foreclosures. This could result in an increase in our charge-offs and provision for loan losses. Either of these events would have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nA significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, acts of terrorism or other factors beyond our control could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because multi-family and commercial real estate loans represent the majority of our real estate loans outstanding, a decline in tenant occupancy due to such factors or for other reasons could adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans on a timely basis, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe mismanagement of our credit risks could result in serious harm to our business.\nThere are a variety of risks inherent in making loans, including, among others, risks inherent with dealing with borrowers and guarantors, risks associated with potential future changes in the value of the collateral supporting the loans, the risk that a loan may not be repaid, and the risks associated with changes in economic or industry conditions. As part of our ongoing efforts to minimize these credit-related risks, we utilize credit policies and procedures, internal credit expertise and several internal layers of review for the loans we make. We also actively monitor our concentrations of loans and carefully evaluate the credit underwriting practices of acquired institutions. However, there can be no assurance that these underwriting and monitoring procedures will reduce these risks, and the inability to properly manage our credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of liquidity could impair our ability to fund our business and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is a critical component of our business. To ensure adequate liquidity to fund our operations, we rely heavily on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage both the repayment of loans and the maturity schedules of our investment securities. Our most important source of funds is deposits, but sources of funds also include, among other things, cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, and borrowings from the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. This could result in a lack of liquidity, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nDeteriorating credit quality in our credit card portfolio may adversely impact us.\nWe have a sizeable consumer credit card portfolio. Although we experienced a decreased amount of net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio in recent years, the amount of net charge-offs could worsen. While we continue to experience a better performance with respect to net charge-offs than the national average in our credit card portfolio, our net charge-offs were 1.86% and 1.64% of our average outstanding credit card balances for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Future downturns in the economy could adversely affect consumers in a more delayed fashion compared to commercial businesses in general. Increasing unemployment and diminished asset values may prevent our credit card customers from repaying their credit card balances which could result in an increased amount of our net charge-offs that could have a material adverse effect on our unsecured credit card portfolio.\nWe face strong competition from other banks, bank holding companies, and financial services companies.\nIn the markets we serve, the businesses of banking and financial services are fiercely competitive. Many of our competitors offer the same, or similar, products and services within our market areas. Some of our competitors are able to offer a broader range of products and services than we do. These competitors include banks with nationwide presences, regional banks, and community banks (who may have greater flexibility in their operational strategies than we possess). We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, among others, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms. If we are unable to effectively compete for banking customers, we may lose loan and deposit market share, as well as experience reductions in net interest margin, fee income, and profitability, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur growth and expansion strategy may not be successful, and our market value and profitability may suffer.\nWe have historically employed, as important parts of our business strategy, growth through acquisitions of banks and, to a lesser extent, through branch acquisitions and de novo branching. Any future acquisitions in which we might engage will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks include, among other risks:\n\u2022\ncredit risk associated with the acquired bank\u2019s loans and investments;\n\u2022\ndifficulty of integrating operations and personnel; and\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business.\nIn addition to pursuing the acquisition of existing viable financial institutions as opportunities arise we may also continue to engage in de novo branching to further our growth strategy. De novo branching and growing through acquisition involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe significant costs and potential operating losses associated with establishing a de novo branch or a new bank;\n\u2022\nthe inability to secure the services of qualified senior management;\n\u2022\nthe local market may not accept the services of a new bank owned and managed by a bank holding company headquartered outside of the market area of the new bank;\n\u2022\nthe risk of encountering an economic downturn in the new market;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain attractive locations within a new market at a reasonable cost; and\n\u2022\nthe additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls.\nWe expect that competition for suitable acquisition candidates will be significant. We may compete with other banks or financial service companies that are seeking to acquire our acquisition candidates, many of which are larger competitors and have greater financial and other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions. Further, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions and de novo branching. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business and growth strategy and maintain or increase our market value and profitability.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $1.1 billion of goodwill and $127.3 million of other intangible assets. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock, any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein, may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill. Future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIdentifiable intangible assets other than goodwill consist of core deposit intangibles, books of business, and other intangible assets. Adverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of these intangible assets including loss of core deposits, significant losses of customer accounts and/or balances, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent these intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, a non-cash impairment charge would be recorded, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses.\nIt is likely that some portion of our loans will become delinquent, and some loans may only be partially repaid or may never be repaid. We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that results from management\u2019s review of the existing portfolio and management\u2019s assessment of the portfolio\u2019s collectability. Our methodology for establishing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires management to make significant estimates and predictions regarding credit risks, future market conditions, and other factors, all of which are subject to material changes and may not necessarily be in our control. If our methodology is flawed, or if we experience changes in market or economic conditions, or in conditions of our borrowers\u2019, we the allowance may become inadequate, which would result in additional provisions to increase the allowance to an appropriate level. This could negatively impact our business, including through a material decrease in our earnings. In addition, prudential regulators also periodically review our allowance for loan losses and have the ability, based on their perspective, which may be different from ours, to require that we make adjustments to the allowance, which could also have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur recent results do not indicate our future results and may not provide guidance to assess the risk of an investment in our common stock.\nWe may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or be able to expand our business. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence. We may also be unable to identify advantageous acquisition opportunities or, once identified, enter into transactions to make such acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully grow our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and competitive pressures. We have traditionally obtained funds principally through local deposits as we have a base of lower cost transaction deposits. Our costs of funds and our profitability and liquidity are likely to be adversely affected if we have to rely upon higher cost borrowings from other institutional lenders or brokers to fund loan demand or liquidity needs. Also, changes in our deposit mix and growth could adversely affect our profitability and the ability to expand our loan portfolio.\nOur models and estimations may be inadequate, which could lead to significant losses and regulatory scrutiny.\nTo assist with the management of our credit, liquidity, operations, and compliance functions and risks, we have developed, and currently use, various models and other analytical tools, including certain estimations. The models and estimations often take into account assumptions and historical trends and are, in some case, based on subjective judgments. As such, the models and estimations may not be effective in identifying and managing risks, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Inadequate models may also result in compliance failures, which could lead to increased scrutiny by our regulators.\nWe may not be able to raise the additional capital we need to grow and, as a result, our ability to expand our operations could be materially impaired.\nFederal and state regulatory authorities require us and our subsidiary bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Many circumstances could require us to seek additional capital, such as:\n\u2022\nfaster than anticipated growth;\n\u2022\nreduced earning levels;\n\u2022\noperating losses;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions;\n\u2022\nrevisions in regulatory requirements; or\n\u2022\nadditional acquisition opportunities.\nOur ability to raise additional capital will largely depend on our financial performance, and on conditions in the capital markets which are outside our control. If we need additional capital but cannot raise it on terms acceptable to us, our ability to expand our operations or to engage in acquisitions could be materially impaired.\nAccounting standards periodically change and the application of our accounting policies and methods may require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nThe regulatory bodies that establish accounting standards, including, among others, FASB and the SEC, periodically revise or issue new financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The effect of such revised or new standards on our financial statements can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, that effective January 1, 2020, substantially changed the accounting for credit losses and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. The standard removes the existing \u201cprobable\u201d threshold in generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets. Companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In December 2018, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC released a final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to address the upcoming change to the allowance measurement and subsequent concerns related to the impact on capital and capital planning. The rule provides, and we adopted, an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital impact upon adoption of the standard. The adoption of the standard resulted in an overall material increase in the allowance for credit losses. However, the impact at adoption was influenced by the portfolios' composition and quality at the adoption date as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. It is also possible that ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be negatively impacted in periods following adoption.\nIn addition, our management must exercise judgment in appropriately applying many of our accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles. In some cases, management may have to select a particular accounting policy or method from two or more alternatives. In some cases, the accounting policy or method chosen might be reasonable under the circumstances and yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported if we had selected a different policy or method. Accounting policies are critical to fairly presenting our financial condition and results of operations and may require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain.\nWe are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, and our associated legal expenses may adversely affect our results.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation. Litigation and claims can arise in various contexts, including, among others, our lending activities, employment practices, commercial agreements, fiduciary responsibilities, compliance programs, and other general business matters. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large amounts in controversy, significant fines or penalties, and substantial legal costs necessary for our defense. The outcome of litigation and regulatory matters, as well as the timing associated with resolving these matters, are inherently hard to predict. Substantial legal liability, which may not be insured, and significant regulatory actions against us could materially and adversely impact our business operations, including our ability to engage in mergers and acquisitions, our results of operations, and our financial condition.\nOur business is heavily reliant on information technology systems, facilities, and processes; and a disruption in those systems, facilities, and processes, or a breach, including cyber-attacks, in the security of our systems, could have significant, negative impact on our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, and create significant financial and legal exposure for us.\nOur businesses are dependent on our ability and the ability of our third-party service providers to process, record and monitor a large number of transactions. If the financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities fail to operate properly, become disabled, experience security breaches or have other significant shortcomings, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough we and our third party service providers devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, there is no assurance that our security systems and those of our third party service providers will provide absolute security. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Certain financial institutions in the United States have also experienced attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties that were intended to disrupt normal business activities by making internet banking systems inaccessible to customers for extended periods. These \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d attacks have not breached our data security systems, but require substantial resources to defend, and may affect customer satisfaction and behavior.\nDespite our efforts and those of our third party service providers to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile payments and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. If our security systems were penetrated or circumvented, it could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage our computers or systems and those of our customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe depend on qualified employees and key personnel to operate and lead our business, and we may not be able to attract or retain them in the future.\nA critical component of our success is the ability to attract and retain highly qualified, skilled lending, operations, information technology, and other employees, as well as managers who are experienced and effective at leading their respective departments. We have an experienced group of senior management and other key personnel that our board of directors believes is capable of managing and growing our business. In many areas of the financial services industry, competition for key personnel is fierce, and the departure of those individuals from our business presents risk that we will be unable to attract and retain suitable successors, which could have a material, adverse impact on our competitive position in the marketplace.\nDamage to our reputation could significantly harm our business.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, employees, and acquisition partners is influenced by our reputation. A negative opinion of our business can develop in connection with a variety of circumstances, including issues with our lending practices, regulatory compliance, risk management, corporate governance, customer service, community involvement, integration of acquired institutions, and third-party service providers. Our reputation could also be harmed through regulatory proceedings by governmental authorities, litigation, or cybersecurity events. Reputational damage could also impact our relationships with investors, our credit ratings and our ability to access capital markets.\nThe Federal Reserve Board\u2019s source of strength doctrine could require that we divert capital to our subsidiary bank instead of applying available capital towards planned uses, such as engaging in acquisitions or paying dividends to shareholders.\nThe FRB\u2019s policies and regulations require that a bank holding company, including a financial holding company, serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks, and further provide that a bank holding company may not conduct operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. It is the FRB\u2019s policy that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity, such as during periods of significant loan losses, and that such holding company should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks if such a need were to arise.\nA bank holding company\u2019s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the FRB\u2019s regulations, or both. Accordingly, if the financial condition of our subsidiary bank was to deteriorate, we could be compelled to provide financial support to our subsidiary bank at a time when, absent such FRB policy, we may not deem it advisable to provide such assistance. Under such circumstances, there is a possibility that we may not either have adequate available capital or feel sufficiently confident regarding our financial condition, to enter into acquisitions, pay dividends, or engage in other corporate activities.\nWe may incur environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the course of our business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate and could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may become responsible to a governmental agency or third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with environmental investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur management has broad discretion over the use of proceeds from future stock offerings.\nAlthough we generally indicate our intent to use the proceeds from stock offerings for general corporate purposes, including funding internal growth and selected future acquisitions, our Board of Directors retains significant discretion with respect to the use of the proceeds from possible future offerings. If we use the funds to acquire other businesses, there can be no assurance that any business we acquire will be successfully integrated into our operations or otherwise perform as expected.\nOur business is heavily reliant on a variety of third-party service providers.\nWe rely on a large number of vendors to provide products and services that we need for our day-to-day operations, particularly in the areas of loan and deposit operations, information technology, and security. This reliance exposes us to the risk that the vendors will not perform in accordance with the applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements, as well as risks resulting from defective products, poor performance of services, disruption in a product or service, or loss of a product or service if a vendor ceases doing business because of its own financial or operational difficulties. These risks, if realized, could result in significant disruptions to our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain a vendor management program designed to assist in the oversight and monitoring of our third-party service providers, there can be no assurance that we will not experience service-related issues associated with our vendors.\nIf we are unsuccessful in developing new, and adapting our current, products and services so that they respond to changing industry standards and customer preferences, our business may suffer.\nWe provide a variety of commercial and consumer banking, as well as other financial, products and services designed to meet a broad range of needs. While many of these products and services are traditional both in their characteristics and their delivery channels, advancements in technology, changes in the regulatory environment, and evolving customer preferences require that we continuously evaluate the terms under which we provide our existing products and services (including, among other things, interest rates and loan covenants), the methods by which we deliver them (including the use of online and mobile banking), and the potential for new products and services in order to remain competitive. These efforts, though, could require substantial investments, and we can provide no assurance that we will develop new products and services, or adequately adapt our existing products and services, in a timely or successful manner. Our inability to do so could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.\nOur controls and procedures may fail, or our employees may not adhere to them.\nIt is critical that our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures be effective in order to provide assurance that our financial reports and disclosures are materially accurate. A failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or a failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as cause reputational harm, which could limit our ability to access the capital markets.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nThe holders of our subordinated notes and subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders. If we defer payments of interest on our outstanding subordinated debentures or if certain defaults relating to those debentures occur, we will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on, and from making liquidation payments with respect to our common stock.\nWe have subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are unconditionally guaranteed by us. The subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on our common stock. In addition, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of both the subordinated debentures and the subordinated notes must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our capital stock. If we elect to defer or if we default with respect to our obligations to make payments on these subordinated debentures, this would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock. Moreover, without notice to or consent from the holders of our common stock, we may issue additional series of subordinated debt securities in the future with terms similar to those of our existing subordinated debt securities or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to purchase or to pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock.\nWe may be unable to, or choose not to, pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe cannot assure you of our ability to continue to pay dividends. Our ability to pay dividends depends on the following factors, among others:\n\u2022\nWe may not have sufficient earnings since our primary source of income, the payment of dividends to us by our subsidiary bank, is subject to federal and state laws that limit the ability of those banks to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nFRB policy requires bank holding companies to pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and financial condition; and\n\u2022\nOur Board of Directors may determine that, even though funds are available for dividend payments, retaining the funds for internal uses, such as expansion of our operations, is a better strategy.\nIf we fail to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be the sole opportunity for gains on an investment in our common stock. In addition, in the event our subsidiary bank becomes unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our debt or pay our other obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, our inability to receive dividends from our subsidiary bank could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of your investment in our common stock.\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or preferred stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.\nShares of our common stock, as well as our other securities, are not insured deposits and may lose value.\nShares of the Company\u2019s common stock, as well as our other securities, are not savings accounts, deposits, or other obligations of any depository institution, and those shares are not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency or instrumentality or private insurer. Investments in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or other securities, therefore, are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 91855, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SFNC"}
