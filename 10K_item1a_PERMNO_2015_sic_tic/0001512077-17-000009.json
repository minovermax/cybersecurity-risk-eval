{"cik": "1512077", "company": "Global Eagle Entertainment Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-11-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves substantial risks. In addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have not been remediated. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to generate timely and accurate financial statements.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 relating to resources and the timeliness of our financial statement close process, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the \u201c2015 Form 10-K\u201d).\nIn addition to the material weakness related to the financial statement close process that existed as of December 31, 2015, we identified additional material weaknesses during and after the fiscal year 2016. These related to our entity level control environment, financial statement close and reporting process, intercompany process, business combination, significant and unusual non-routine transactions, inventory, content library, internally developed software, long lived assets, goodwill impairment, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, revenue processes, license fee accruals, income taxes, payroll, stock-based compensation, treasury, and information technology processes. We believe these additional material weaknesses are the result of the growth of our Company, insufficient automation in our financial reporting environment, increased complexity of our business transactions, and increased decentralization of our operations. In retrospect, we have concluded that the above-described changes to our business were not adequately supported by the hiring of additional personnel with sufficient, specific expertise in accounting, finance and information technology. Moreover, we experienced significant turnover in our executive management during 2016 and 2017. For additional information about the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nWe will continue to expend significant financial resources to remediate these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as well as to perform additional procedures to compensate for our material weaknesses in order to complete our financial statement closing. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce financial statements in a timely manner or without material misstatements. The material weaknesses that we have identified may impair our ability to timely identify and forecast certain business trends and certain aspects of our financial performance. Our failure to timely produce financial statements may also constitute defaults or give rise to penalties under our debt instruments if we are unable to comply with our reporting covenants. Nasdaq could also delist our common stock if we are delinquent in our SEC filings, thereby impairing the trading liquidity of our common stock. A delisting would trigger the repurchase option under the indenture governing our convertible notes (as further described under \u201cRisks Relating to our Common Stock\u201d) and have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to remediate our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, then investors, customers, rating agencies, lenders or others may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our securities could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities or litigation that results in substantial fines, penalties or liabilities. As a result, we may be unable to raise funds from debt and equity investors on terms favorable to us, if at all.\nOn September 13, 2017, Nasdaq notified us that we are currently not compliant with Nasdaq rules and that the Nasdaq staff had determined to delist our common stock. We appealed that determination and had a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel on October 26, 2017. On November 3, 2017, Nasdaq granted our request for an extension to regain compliance with Nasdaq rules.\nNasdaq granted us our requested extension until November 30, 2017 to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and until January 31, 2018 to file our Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2017.\nOur management has concluded that our disclosure controls are ineffective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could continue to be impaired, and the market price of our securities may be negatively affected.\nOur management has historically concluded that we do not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. In connection with our 2016 audit, our management assessed our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that they were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting discussed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nWe will continue to expend significant financial resources to remediate these material weaknesses. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may continue to be unable to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, investors, customers, rating agencies, lenders or others may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our securities could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities or litigation that results in substantial fines, penalties or liabilities.\nWe have expended significant time and resources in connection with our 2016 audit and expect to incur additional expenses in connection with our efforts to remediate our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe have expended significant time and costs in connection with our 2016 audit, which were funded primarily through amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility, due to our current liquidity constraints. Additional costs associated with our efforts to remediate our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and restructuring our business could constrain our liquidity further, requiring us to seek amendments or waivers to our credit agreement or obtain additional financing by issuing debt or equity securities. As of the date of filing of this Form 10-K, other than approximately $1 million of availability that we are reserving for foreign currency fluctuations on outstanding letters of credit, we had no capacity remaining under our revolving credit facility. If in the future we have additional capacity on that facility, one of the conditions to drawing on the facility is confirmation that the representations and warranties in our credit agreement are true as of the date of borrowing. If we are unable to make that confirmation, then we will be unable to draw down further on the revolver.\nIf we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe implementation by us of a new revenue recognition standard in 2018 (ASC 606) requires substantial preparation and expenditures, and our failure to properly implement this standard in a timely manner could result in inaccurate revenue recognition and disclosure and cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new revenue recognition guidance under ASC 606, which is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning after December 31, 2017. Under this new guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The new guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.\nIn order to be able to comply with the requirements of ASC 606 beginning in the first quarter of 2018, we need to update and enhance our internal accounting systems, processes and our internal controls over financial reporting. This has required, and will continue to require, additional investments by us, and may require incremental resources and system configurations that could increase our operating costs in future periods. If we are not able to properly implement ASC 606 in a timely manner, the revenue that we recognize and the related disclosures that we provide under ASC 606 may not be complete or accurate, and we could fail\nto meet our financial reporting obligations in a timely manner, which could result in, among other things, regulatory discipline, failure to satisfy the requirements of our debt instruments and adversely affect our stock price.\nOur business is dependent on the travel industry and the competitive nature of that industry makes our business sensitive to domestic and international economic conditions.\nOur business is directly affected by the number of passengers flying on commercial airlines and traveling on cruise ships, the financial condition of these airlines and cruise lines and the general availability of travel and related economic conditions around the world. If demand for air or maritime travel declines, the number of aircraft and flights shrink or the travel industry is severely disrupted, the number of passengers available to use our Connectivity and Media & Content offerings will be reduced, which will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects. High unemployment rates, reduced consumer and business spending, recessionary conditions in the United States or Europe and terrorism are among the general economic and social conditions that adversely affect the travel and mobility markets. A general reduction or shift in discretionary spending can result in decreased demand for leisure and business travel and lead to a reduction in the number of airline flights or cruise lines offered, the number of passengers flying or taking cruises and the willingness of airlines and cruise lines to commit to spending funds on items such as our Connectivity and Media & Content offerings.\nEach of our airline and maritime customers operates in an intensely competitive environment and constantly faces pressure for on-board connectivity and content offerings and pricing of all aspects of air and maritime travel. These competitive circumstances could cause one or more of our customers to reduce expenditures on passenger services, including the deployment of our Connectivity and Media & Content offerings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and financial condition.\nIn addition, instability and changes in economic and political conditions across the globe, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts are among the global risks that may impact our business and our plans for expansion. Our operations and performance are sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions, both in the U.S. and globally.\nA future act or threat of terrorism or other events could result in a prohibition on the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft and maritime vessels.\nA future act of terrorism, the threat of such acts or other airline or maritime accidents could have an adverse effect on the travel industry. In the event of a terrorist attack, terrorist threat or other accident, the industry could experience significantly reduced passenger demand. The U.S. federal government could respond to such events by prohibiting the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft and maritime vessels, which would eliminate demand for our equipment and services. As an example, the U.S. and U.K. governments recently passed legislation banning laptops, tablets and other portable electronic devices as carry-on devices on aircraft vessels traveling from several Muslim-majority countries. Even though the bans have been lifted, they remain plausible responses to acts of terrorism and similar bans could adversely affect our business. In addition, any association or perceived association between our equipment or services and such attacks or accidents would likely have an adverse effect on demand for our equipment and services.\nIn a number of countries where we operate our Connectivity segment, we are subject to increased risk of disruption to the business due to terrorist acts, conflicts, wars, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, power outages, pandemics or other public health crises and environmental incidents, wherever located around the world. The potential for future terrorist attacks and natural disasters, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and natural disasters or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars may create economic and political uncertainties. Heightened geopolitical risk, most notably in Africa and the Middle East, could materially adversely affect our Connectivity segment.\nWe may be unable to renew agreements with existing customers or attract new customers on favorable terms or at all.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers and partners and attract new and repeat customers, including dissatisfaction with our services or its consistency, our pricing, the availability of our services, actual or perceived security risks and dissatisfaction with the features of our equipment or services. Additionally, the terms of any future agreements with existing or new customers may be less favorable than our current agreements. We may ultimately fail in entering into agreements with additional customers on competitive terms, and that failure could harm our results of operations due to, among other factors, a diversion of resources, the actual costs of pursuing these opportunities and the inability to deploy committed satellite transponder space segments to additional customers. To the extent that we are unable to secure new customers or that any of our future agreements with existing or new customers are not as favorable as our existing arrangements, our growth and financial prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nFailing to retain and effectively integrate and train key members of senior management could harm our business.\nOur business depends on the continued service and performance of our senior management team, many of whom are recent hires. Such individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our segments and their operations. As a result, if any of these individuals were to leave, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors. In addition, the loss of key members of senior management, as well as other key personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. Furthermore, we may experience a loss of productivity while the new members of senior management obtain the necessary training and expertise to integrate into our business. In early 2017, we had turnover in a substantial number of our senior management positions, including our chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer and chief accounting officer. The process of transitioning successor senior managers into their respective roles will require significant time and financial resources, and the transition may not ultimately be successful.\nWe may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive and execute the growth strategy of our business.\nOur business depends on the continued service and performance of key technical personnel. Such individuals have acquired specialized technical knowledge and skills with respect to our business and operations. As a result, if any of these individuals were to leave, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity. In addition, much of our key technology and systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key technical personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business.\nThe structure of our investment in the WMS joint venture subjects us to risks that may limit our anticipated cash distributions from such investment or prevent us from receiving its anticipated benefits.\nWe own a 49% equity interest in Wireless Maritime Services, LLC (\u201cWMS\u201d), a provider of global cellular roaming services to off-shore vessels. WMS\u2019s managing member owns a 51% equity interest in the WMS joint venture, has the right to nominate three of WMS\u2019s five voting board members and controls the day-to-day operations of WMS. WMS\u2019s profits and losses for any fiscal year are allocated between our joint-venture partner and the Company in proportion to percentage interests owned, after giving effect to any applicable special allocations. The WMS joint venture operating agreement provides for annual cash distributions to us and our joint-venture partner, but those distributions are subject to reduction for certain expenses and other items relating to WMS\u2019s operations, including capital expenditures, as determined by WMS\u2019s board (which we do not control). As a result, we may not receive all or part of our anticipated cash distributions in any period for reasons beyond our control.\nIn addition, our investment in WMS is further subject to various risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nOur interests could diverge from our joint-venture partner\u2019s interests or we may not agree with our joint-venture partner on ongoing activities or on the amount, timing or nature of further investments in WMS;\n\u2022\nWMS profits and cash flows may prove inadequate to fund cash dividends or other distributions to us, or those amounts may be subject to reduction as noted above;\n\u2022\nOur control over the operations of and other decisions relating to WMS is limited;\n\u2022\nDue to differing business models or long term business goals, our joint-venture partner may decide not to fund capital investments in WMS, impairing the value of the WMS joint venture;\n\u2022\nWe may lose the rights to technology or products being developed by WMS, including if our joint-venture partner is acquired by another company, or experiences financial or other losses;\n\u2022\nMany of the contractors on which WMS relies are with our joint-venture partner, and \u201cseconded\u201d to WMS from our joint-venture partner, such that WMS relies on these contractors, personnel and other resources provided to it by our joint-venture partner; and\n\u2022\nWe may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from WMS.\nWe are subject to a variety of complex U.S. and foreign tax laws and regimes as a result of our global footprint, and changes in those laws-or our failure to properly interpret them-may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have numerous offices on six continents, and we provide our products and services globally. As a result, we are subject to a variety of complex U.S. and foreign tax laws and regimes, and changes in those laws and regimes-and our failure to properly conduct our operations in compliance with them-could be costly and expose us to fines, penalties or tax obligations that we did not anticipate. This could occur due to, among other things, unclear or unsettled tax laws, lack of clarity as to whether we have \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d exposure, intercompany charges, value-added tax and income tax-liability in some countries where we conduct operations. Our failure to comply with any of these laws and regimes, or increased enforcement activity by tax regulators, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to make claims for investment tax credits in Canada.\nOur Canadian subsidiary, DTI Software, makes claims for currently available tax credits in Canada in the course of its development of games and applications in Canada, including tax credits that support multimedia, e-commerce and research and development in Canada. If governmental authorities in Canada, and, in particular, in the province of Quebec, were to reduce or eliminate the amount of tax credits that are available in respect of these activities by DTI, then our tax liabilities would likely increase and our overall profitability would be negatively impacted. In 2016, we paid approximately $1.1 million in taxes in Canada after taking advantage of approximately $0.1 million in offsetting tax credits.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risks in our Media & Content segment.\nWithin our Media & Content segment, sales to customers and purchasing are largely transacted in U.S. dollars, while most of our Media & Content segment\u2019s operating companies\u2019 fixed costs are incurred in local currencies such as euros, British pounds, Indian rupees and Canadian dollars, which exposes us to currency risks. We cannot preclude the possibility of negative foreign currency effects in the future, some of which may be substantial, due to unforeseen exchange rate fluctuations or inaccurate assessments of market developments.\nThere are also intragroup receivables and liabilities in our Media & Content segment, such as loans, that can generate significant foreign currency effects. Changes in the exchange rates of a number of foreign currencies against the euro, especially the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, could lead to the recognition of unrealized foreign exchange losses.\nRisks Related to Our Connectivity Segment\nOur Connectivity segment\u2019s revenue is largely dependent upon our existing relationship and agreement with Southwest Airlines.\nOur existing supply and services agreement with Southwest Airlines, which we entered into on December 13, 2016, governs our supply of products and services to Southwest Airlines, including our broadband equipment, Wi-Fi service in connection with the use of our broadband system, live television-related services and certain additional contemplated services. Our Connectivity segment is substantially dependent on this customer relationship, which accounted for 54%, 85% and 83% of such segment\u2019s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 22%, 23% and 24% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. In addition, a significant source of our revenue and operating income is generated from the supply of live television-related services to Southwest Airlines. If we fail to maintain certain minimum service level requirements relating to such television service, or if we fail to meet other obligations relating to our technology, equipment or services, Southwest Airlines may have the right to terminate such television service or the supply and services agreement. Further, there is no guarantee that Southwest Airlines will continue to maintain historical levels of fleet installation growth and services with us. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain our existing relationship with Southwest Airlines or if such television service or the supply and services agreement is terminated.\nThe success of our Connectivity segment depends on the investment in and development of new broadband technologies and advanced communications and secure networking systems, products and services, as well as their market acceptance.\nBroadband, advanced communications and secure networking markets are subject to rapid technological change, frequent new and enhanced product and service introductions, product obsolescence and changes in user requirements. Our ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to develop leading technologies in existing and emerging broadband, advanced communications and secure networking markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop, introduce and sell new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis that respond to ever-changing customer requirements;\n\u2022\nour ability to enhance our product and service offerings by continuing to increase satellite capacity, bandwidth cost efficiencies and service quality and adding innovative features that differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nsuccessful integration of various elements of our complex technologies and system architectures;\n\u2022\ntimely completion and introduction of new system and product designs;\n\u2022\nachievement of acceptable product and service costs;\n\u2022\nestablishment of close working relationships with major customers for the design of their new communications and secure networking systems incorporating our products and services;\n\u2022\nmarketing and pricing strategies of our competitors with respect to competitive products and services; and\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our new products and services.\nWe cannot guarantee that our new technology, product or service offerings in our Connectivity segment will be successful or that any of the new technologies, products or services we offer will achieve sufficient market acceptance. Our Connectivity segment may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent us from successfully selecting, developing, manufacturing or marketing new technologies, products or services, and these efforts could divert our attention and resources from other projects. We cannot be sure that such efforts and expenditures will ultimately lead to the timely development of new offerings and technologies. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or divert resources from other projects. In addition, defects may be found in our products after we begin deliveries that could result in degradation of service quality, and the delay or loss of market acceptance. If we are unable to design, manufacture, integrate and market profitable new products and services for existing or emerging markets, it could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face increased demand for greater bandwidth, speed and performance from customers in an increasingly competitive environment featuring new technologies and market entrants, which may require us to maintain increased service levels at higher costs and make significant investments in improving our Connectivity platform.\nCompetition among providers of connectivity solutions, including satellite providers who can leverage their own gateways and satellite constellations to provide connectivity solutions directly to customers, may impact prices received for services. Moreover, if demand for greater bandwidth, Internet streaming, speed and performance of our network increases, we may be forced to expend substantial financial and other resources in investing in future satellite transponder capacity and network infrastructure and improve our overall satellite-based and related technologies to ensure that we meet such demands from our current and future customers. The costs of obtaining current and future satellite capacity may also be impacted by limitations in global satellite capacity. Should demand increase for greater bandwidth, speed and performance beyond our current capabilities in this increasingly competitive environment featuring new technologies and direct satellite providers directly competing with our offerings, we may be required to significantly invest in improving our Connectivity solution or to leverage our existing platform, including our Media & Content services offerings, to further develop and deploy more cost-effective connectivity solutions.\nWe may experience customer attrition as satellite capacity providers increasingly enter into arrangements directly with customers.\nWe rely on satellite providers to secure the satellite capacity needed to conduct our Connectivity operations and provide Connectivity services to customers. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the capacity needed to conduct our operations at current rates and levels moving forward, or to obtain capacity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Satellite manufacturers, satellite owners and other satellite providers are increasingly seeking to enter into arrangements directly with our customers for satellite capacity and services. As a result, we may experience customer attrition and may be unable to compete with satellite providers who could offer greater pricing flexibility and satellite capacity options given their place in the supply chain. Our failure to compete with satellite providers, or new-entrant providers, and offer favorable pricing arrangements to customers could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on \u201csole source\u201d service providers and other third parties for certain key components of, and services relating to, our Connectivity segment.\nWe currently source key components of our hardware and key features of our Connectivity services from sole providers of equipment and network services, respectively, including the satellite antenna sourced from TECOM Industries, Inc., or TECOM, and substantially all of our Connectivity segment\u2019s satellite modems from Hughes. If we experience a disruption in the delivery of products and services from any of our key providers it may be difficult for us to continue providing our own products and services to our customers. We have experienced component delivery issues in the past and there can be no assurance that we will avoid similar issues in the future. In addition, the supply of third party components in general could be interrupted or halted by a termination of our relationships with such third parties, a failure of quality control or other operational problems at such suppliers or a significant decline in their financial conditions. If we are unable to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our Connectivity segment, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, any loss of favored nation relationships that we have with our hardware providers today could eliminate our competitive advantage in the use of satellites for in-flight connectivity in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying new global antenna technologies.\nWe have entered into a long-term development project with QEST to develop new global antenna technologies, and have made and continue to make significant product development investments to our existing connectivity technology solutions to address these new technologies. Since our new global antenna technologies have yet to be deployed for commercial use, there can be no assurance that such technologies will perform as expected or be commercially available on our current timeline, if at all, due to, among other things, problems arising in the development process, and delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals to deploy and operate such technologies. If the technologies fail to perform as expected or their commercial availability is significantly delayed, our business, business prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may need to materially increase our investments in product development and equipment in connection with our efforts to grow our Connectivity segments\u2019 service line and remain competitive in the future, which the Company could be unable to do if it is liquidity constrained.\nWe have historically incurred significant product development expenses to support the growth of our Connectivity services and offerings and we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources as we continue to grow our Connectivity segment and increase our investments in satellite-based technologies and our product offerings. As current and future product development efforts progress, such as our currently-in-process Boeing line-fit initiative (that allows the Company to install its connectivity equipment on aircraft during assembly), QEST antenna development, expansions in our satellite-based services and capabilities, Airtime IFE product offering development, investments in Ku-HTS technologies and capital investments in Connectivity equipment for new and existing customers and services, the costs of our Connectivity segment may materially fluctuate in future periods, which could negatively affect our future operating results. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to numerous variables, including the availability and timing of next-generation technologies, the need and related costs to develop and implement changes to our software and hardware or to expand our service offerings to be competitive and, with respect to satellite technologies, the need and related costs of obtaining current and future satellite capacity. The capital investments and related costs may be significant, and we may have insufficient liquidity or resources to make those investments in the future.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding our Connectivity segment internationally, and our international operations are subject to a variety of risks.\nWe operate our Connectivity segment in numerous countries around the world and intend to continue to expand the number of countries in which we operate. Our ability to expand our Connectivity segment internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in unfamiliar markets and the possibility that there may not be returns on these investments in the near future comparable to our recent financial results or at all. We may need to adopt technological solutions for broadband Internet that are different than those we deploy domestically, we may be unable to find content or service providers to partner with on commercially reasonable terms for foreign markets, or at all, and we cannot provide assurance that changes in geopolitics will not result in restrictions on the expansion of our business, such as restrictions on foreign ownership of telecommunications providers or the establishment of economic sanctions by the United States affecting businesses such as ours. In addition, in expanding our operations internationally, we expose our business to the risks and uncertainties relating to the international financial markets, compliance with international regulations and policies, the complexity of managing foreign operations and human resources and more acute exposure to the impact of international governmental and political changes and conflicts.\nMany of the countries in which we operate our Connectivity segment have legal systems that are less developed and less predictable than legal systems in the United States, and, as a result, our international expansion exposes us to potential increased costs and uncertainties. New rules and regulations may be enacted or existing rules and regulations may be applied or interpreted in a manner which could limit our ability to provide the services of our Connectivity segment in the countries in which we wish to operate.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our Connectivity customers may be negatively impacted by service interruptions or delays, technology failures, damage to equipment or software defects or errors.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers depends, in part, upon the reliable performance of our Connectivity segment\u2019s satellite transponder capacity, network infrastructure and connectivity system. The uninterrupted operations and services of our Connectivity segment depend upon the extent to which our equipment and the equipment of our third-party network providers is protected against damage from fire, flood, earthquakes, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, break-ins, acts of war or terrorism and similar events or factors beyond our control. Our Connectivity segment has experienced interruptions in these systems in the past, including infrastructure, component and service failures that cause service disruptions, service delays or technology or systems failures. If we experience frequent system or network failures, our reputation could be harmed and our Connectivity customers may have the right to terminate their contracts with us or pursue other remedies. Any such impact to our reputation or ability to attract, retain and serve our Connectivity customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the software underlying our Connectivity services is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when software is first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Any defects or errors, particularly those that cause interruptions to the availability of our Connectivity services could result in termination or failure to renew contracts by our airline customers, reputational risk and reductions in sales or sales credits or refunds to our customers. The costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our software may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure of our equipment or material defects or errors in our software may damage our reputation or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, requiring us to pay significant damages and impairing our ability to offer our Connectivity services.\nThe products offered by our Connectivity segment contain complex systems and components that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technologies. If any of our Connectivity products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such events could result in significant expenses and material liabilities, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. If our Connectivity segment\u2019s on-board equipment has a severe malfunction or if there is a problem with equipment installation which damages an aircraft or maritime vessel or impairs its on-board electronics or avionics, significant property loss and serious personal injury or death could result. Any such failure could expose us to material product liability claims or costly repair obligations. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any such claims. A product recall or a product liability claim not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our indemnity obligations to our enterprise customers may include losses due to third-party claims (such as from their end-users, e.g., their passengers) and, in certain cases, the causes for such losses may include failure of our products. Such indemnity obligations are difficult to quantify but may result in significant expenses. In addition to such costs, any material defects or errors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which could impair our ability to continue to offer our Connectivity services in the future.\nSatellite failures or degradations in satellite performance could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use leased and Company-owned satellite capacity to support our broadband services for our Connectivity segment. Satellites utilize complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and, accordingly, are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions (commonly referred to as anomalies), interference from electrostatic storms, and collisions with meteoroids, decommissioned spacecraft or other space debris. The satellites we employ for our Connectivity segment have experienced various anomalies in the past and will likely experience anomalies in the future. Anomalies can occur as a result of various factors, such as satellite manufacturer error, whether due to the use of new or largely unproven technology or due to a design, manufacturing or assembly defect that was not discovered before launch and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the space environment.\nAdditionally, the Company uses for some of its services inclined orbit satellites. These are satellites that are operating beyond their original design life and have reduced their station keeping fuel consumption rate so that they no longer remain in a zero\ndegree inclination orbit. Their remaining useful life is a function of how long the remaining fuel can be used to maintain an acceptable orbit inclination to allow us to provide services to our customers. Once the onboard fuel has been exhausted, these satellites may not be able to provide useful services.\nAny single anomaly or series of anomalies, or other operational failure or degradation, on any of the satellites, or the complete loss of a satellite, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and revenue and our relationships with current customers and distributors, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Anomalies may also reduce the expected useful life of a satellite, thereby creating additional expense due to the need to provide replacement or backup capacity and potentially reducing revenue if service is interrupted or degraded on the satellites utilized. We may not be able to obtain backup capacity or a replacement satellite on reasonable economic terms, a reasonable schedule or at all.\nAlthough many satellites have redundant or backup systems and components that operate in the event of an anomaly, operational failure or degradation of primary critical components, these redundant or backup systems and components are subject to risk of failure similar to those experienced by the primary systems and components. The occurrence of a failure of any of these redundant or backup systems and components could materially impair the useful life, capacity or operational capabilities of the satellite.\nAdditional businesses or technologies we acquire or invest in could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our ongoing business, dilute stockholder value or have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may engage in further acquisitions of businesses or technologies to augment our growth, or we may invest with third parties in certain U.S. and foreign markets. Acquisitions and investments involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions or investments may not advance our business strategy, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets or may fail. Any past or future acquisition or investment could also involve additional risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential impact on our ability to produce financial statements in a timely manner, such as with the EMC Acquisition and which acquisition in turn contributed to our material weaknesses in our internal controls in 2016;\n\u2022\npotential distraction of management from our ongoing business and from the remediation of our material weaknesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations and products of the acquired business, including specifically with respect to challenges and delays in timing that we face integrating the acquired EMC business (which could result in delays in the realization of acquisition synergies);\n\u2022\nuse of cash to fund the acquisition or investment or for unanticipated expenses;\n\u2022\nlimited market experience in new businesses;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities, including litigation against the companies that we acquire;\n\u2022\nadditional costs due to differences in culture, geographical locations and duplication of key talent;\n\u2022\ndelays associated with or resources being devoted to regulatory review and approval and other ongoing compliance matters;\n\u2022\nacquisition-related accounting charges affecting our balance sheet and operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the financial results of the acquired business in our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\ncontrols in the acquired business;\n\u2022\nimpairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets, such as the goodwill impairments with respect to the EMC Acquisition that we recognized in 2016 and that we expect to recognize in the first quarter of 2017;\n\u2022\ndilution to our current stockholders from the potential issuance of equity securities to consummate a proposed acquisition or investment; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company.\nIn the event that we enter into any acquisition or investment agreements, closing of the transactions could be delayed or prevented by regulatory approval requirements, including antitrust or national-security reviews or other conditions. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any attempted acquisitions or investments, and we could assume the economic risks of such failed or unsuccessful acquisitions or investments.\nIn certain of our previously completed acquisitions, we have agreed to make future payments, either in the form of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments, or earnouts, based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired businesses. We may use earnouts for acquisitions in the future. The performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or the employees who joined us from the acquired business of certain specified benchmarks during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition. Future acquisitions or investments may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business or investment, grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses (which may be dilutive to existing stockholders), and expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt. The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition. While we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations, our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value.\nAlthough we conducted due diligence in connection with the acquisitions and investments that we have consummated, we cannot be certain that such diligence revealed all material issues that may be present in those businesses, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of our control will not later arise. Even if the due diligence that we conducted in connection with acquisitions or investments that we have already consummated or that we consummate in the future successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis.\nWe may be required to write down or write off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses with respect to any acquisitions or investments we consummate from time to time. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. Any such write-downs, write-offs, restructuring or charges could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe may fail to realize the expected benefits of any acquisitions or investments as rapidly as the expectations of, or to the extent anticipated by, the marketplace, investors, financial analysts or industry analysts. Any such failure may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe may in the future experience losses from fixed-price Connectivity contracts or contracts where our average revenue per customer declines more quickly relative to decreasing (or potentially increasing) associated costs.\nWe typically provide the services of our Connectivity segment for a fixed-rate monthly recurring fee under long-term contracts, which are usually three to five years in length. These contracts carry the risk of potential cost overruns because we assume the burden of all costs under the agreement. We assume greater financial risk on fixed-price contracts than on other types of contracts because our ability to profit on such contracts is dependent on our ability to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately and control costs during the performance of such contracts. If we are unable to estimate or control costs under our fixed price contracts, the net profit of our Connectivity segment may be significantly reduced. Because many of these long-term contracts involve new technologies and applications, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of materials, problems with the suppliers and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. We may in the future experience historical cost overruns and operating losses on at least some of our customer agreements.\nRisks Related to Our Media & Content Segment\nOur Media & Content segment and the related media and content market faces pricing pressure and reduction in the use of intermediary content service providers.\nOur Media & Content business faces pricing pressures from both our customers and studios. Studios, distributors and other content providers seek more expensive pricing for the content that we acquire, and our customers simultaneously demand and negotiate for lower prices and rates for the content and services that we provide. We cannot assure you that we can maintain any current pricing efficiencies with studios, distributors and other content providers, and we may need to provide price concessions in order to acquire new customers or retain current customers in the future. Changes to our cost structure and pricing that reduce our overall yields may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our customers may reduce their use of intermediary content service providers (such as us) and seek to obtain content directly from content creators and distributors (i.e., directly from our content suppliers). If our customers execute engagements directly with studios, distributors and other content creators, then our business as a content service provider will be adversely affected.\nOur revenue may be adversely affected by a reduction or elimination of the time between our receipt of content and the content being made more broadly publicly available to the rental or home viewing market (i.e., the \u201cearly release window\u201d).\nWe receive the content that we provide directly from studios, distributors and other content providers, and the timing of our receipt of such content is at the discretion of such content providers. Historically, we have received content prior to its availability to the public through the rental or retail markets or Internet streaming services and we have taken advantage of this \u201cearly release window\u201d in our business by offering our enterprise customers media and content options before they become generally available to their passengers. However, if content providers delay the release of content in a manner that reduces or eliminates the \u201cearly release window,\u201d we may be unable to generate anticipated revenue in our Media & Content segment because passengers may have the opportunity to consume or download such content at home rather than in-flight.\nA reduction in the volume or quality of content produced by studios, distributors or other content providers could diminish the attractiveness of our Media & Content products for passengers.\nWe receive content from studios, distributors and other content providers, and, in some circumstances, we depend on the volume and quality of the content that these content providers produce. If such providers were to reduce the volume or quality of content that they make available to us, whether due to their own financial limitations or other factors influencing their businesses, we would have less quality content to choose from, and our programmers would have more difficulty finding relevant and appropriate content to provide to our customers. This could negatively impact the passenger experience, which could, in turn, reduce the demand for our Media & Content segment\u2019s offerings and would have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.\nWe face competition from the increasing on-board use of personal electronic devices and the greater capabilities for passengers to access and download content to such devices prior to travel, which may, among other things, cause passengers to substitute our IFE services offered in our Media & Content segment with \u201cover-the-top\u201d download services.\nEver-increasing numbers of passengers have personal electronic devices or other digital platforms which have the ability to deliver passengers content in-flight, such as movies, music or games or to access on-board connectivity to the Internet, live television or content on demand. In addition, passengers also may subscribe or have access to \u201cover-the-top\u201d download services (such as Amazon and Netflix) that permit them to download content onto their personal electronic devices prior to travel that they can then access in transit without Wi-Fi or Internet. Being able to use these download and streaming services as an alternative to any media and content that we may be able to provide to our airline or maritime customers may devalue our content service offerings because those passengers will use those alternative platforms instead of our own. If passengers no longer utilize traditional IFE systems for the delivery of content and the demand for our services declines, our customers may cease engaging with us for their content service provider needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Connectivity segment competes with other companies that offer IFE and IFC systems, and such competition could deter those companies from engaging our Company as a content service provider.\nOur Connectivity segment competes with large companies that offer various products and services in the IFE and IFC supply chain. As such competition with companies in our supply chain continues to increase, our relationship with those companies may deteriorate and actively reduce potential business opportunities. For example, there are companies in our industry that not only compete with our Connectivity segment but also determine the specific IFE system to be utilized on board. Our opportunity to provide services and offerings in our Media & Content segment with respect to such IFE system may be hindered by the competition created by the Connectivity side of our business. If our relationship with such companies that control multiple levels of the supply chain is impacted by the Connectivity solutions that we offer, our Media & Content segment could be adversely affected as a result.\nThe long sales cycle of many of our Media & Content segment\u2019s products increases the difficulty of our expense planning and revenue forecasting and may cause us to expend substantial resources without any assurance of an acceptable financial return.\nMany of our Media & Content segment\u2019s products have long sales cycles that involve numerous steps, including initial customer contacts, specification writing, software engineering design, software prototyping, pilot testing, device certification,\nregulatory approvals, marketing and sales efforts and commercial manufacture, integration and delivery. During this cycle, we may expend substantial financial resources and management time and effort without any assurance or ability to predict when or if product sales will result. Delays in sales may cause us to expend significant resources without any assurance of an acceptable financial return and increases the difficulty of our expense planning and revenue forecasting, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may in the future experience losses from fixed-price Media & Content contracts.\nWe currently have multi-year, fixed-price delivery contracts with some of the studios from which we purchase content which enable us to purchase content during their respective terms at fixed purchase prices, or through \u201cflat deals.\u201d Adjustments to such fixed purchase prices may be advisable or necessary, such as if there are significant changes in customer demand or content supply. If we are unable to make such adjustments or if there is a shift in the customer base under such contracts, then there is a risk that the profit margins on such fixed-price Media & Content contracts may be smaller than predicted or result in a loss. Reduced profit margins or losses in our Media & Content segment resulting from fixed-price contracts could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to retain or attract Media & Content customers if we do not develop new products or enhance those we currently provide.\nThe IFE market is faced with rapid technological change, evolving standards in IFE and computer hardware, software development, communications and security infrastructure, and changing needs and expectations of customers. Building new products and service offerings requires significant investment in development. Our investment in software and other product development may ultimately prove to be unsuccessful, and the Company may be required to impair the capitalized value associated with those investments. We also face uncertainty when we develop or acquire new products for our Media & Content segment because there is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop for those products.\nIn addition, a substantial portion of our Media & Content segment\u2019s research and development resources are devoted to maintenance requirements and product upgrades that address new technology support. These demands put significant constraints on the resources that we have available for new product development. If we are unable to develop new products or enhance those we currently provide in an environment of technological change and evolving standards and customer needs, we may be unable to retain or attract Media & Content customers and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted as a result.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property and Information Technology\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any failure or inability to sufficiently protect them could harm our business and operating results.\nOur proprietary rights to the technologies we use in our products and services, particularly with respect to our proprietary SpeedNet product that improves the web-browsing experience over a satellite connection by proactively storing web content close to the user, are important to the success of our business. We generally rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and contractual rights to protect our proprietary rights in our technology and products. We also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and endeavor to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights adequately, our competitors could use the intellectual property we have developed to enhance their own products and services, which could materially harm our business. Monitoring and preventing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult. In addition, we may be required to commence litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. If we are unsuccessful in any such litigation in the future, our rights to enforce or use such intellectual property may be impaired or we could lose some or all of our rights to such intellectual property. We do not know whether the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, including in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as extensively as in the United States. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time and effort required to create innovative products.\nOur business and reputation could be materially harmed as a result of data breaches, data theft, unauthorized access or hacking.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. In addition, because we engage suppliers and vendors to process personal and payment card information of our customers\nand end-users, our business is dependent on the security and performance of the information technology systems of those suppliers and vendors. An increasing number of companies have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their computer networks. As an example, the content and media industry has recently encountered numerous recent hacks by third parties that have resulted in the premature release of valuable content and the associated loss of revenue. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often, and as a result the techniques are often not recognized until launched against a target. In addition, we may not have identified all potential issues stemming from such unauthorized access. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate such threatening techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures to protect our business from cyber and similar unauthorized attacks on our information technology systems. If unauthorized parties gain access to our or our suppliers\u2019 information technology systems, they may be able to misappropriate assets or sensitive information (such as personally identifiable information of our customers (including their payment card information), business partners and employees), cause interruption in financial systems or operations and corruption of data or computers or otherwise damage our reputation and business. In such circumstances, we could be held liable to our customers, vendors, business partners or other parties or be subject to regulatory or other actions. Any compromise of our security or the security of our suppliers and vendors could result in a loss of confidence in our security measures and subject us to litigation, civil or criminal penalties and negative publicity that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not succeed in implementing a new enterprise resources planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system to assist with remediating our material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nWe have several material weaknesses in our internal controls as a result of our failure to have a robust ERP system. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Our ability to remediate our material weaknesses in our internal controls depends in part on our ability to implement this enhanced ERP system and adequately train our personnel to effectively utilize the new system. We believe that a new ERP system will provide greater depth and breadth of functionality than our current ERP systems, which will allow us to more effectively integrate past and future acquisitions and manage business and financial data, manufacturing and resource planning functions and other business processes and information that is important to our management team. We currently utilize several ERP systems, some of which have been only partially integrated from our acquired businesses. We intend to streamline these disparate systems into a single Oracle ERP system which will require significant time and resources. To date, we have been unable to successfully implement an effective company-wide ERP system due to lack of sufficient qualified resources and inadequate integration of financial and internal control processes following acquisitions. Additional time and resources will be necessary to fully operationalize a new ERP system. We can make no assurance that our efforts to implement such system will be successful or that such system will meet our expectations in respect of our efforts to remediate certain of our material weaknesses.\nWe are subject to civil litigation involving allegations of copyright and patent infringement and related claims for indemnification, which could result in our having to pay damages. We may also be subject to additional similar litigation in the future.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to civil litigation by parties claiming that certain of our audio and music programming offerings infringe the copyright and other intellectual property rights of such parties. Music and related content are subject to complex licensing and intellectual property rights regimes, and if we are unable to successfully navigate those regimes we may incur damages and liability for any rights infringement. In addition, we are, and in the future may be, subject to civil litigation by patent owners that claim that our connectivity systems infringe their patents and other intellectual property rights.\nWe will continue to incur costs to defend and/or settle such lawsuits and such costs may be material. We may be required to pay substantial damages and/or be subject to injunctive relief as a result of these matters, and until resolved, these matters may divert the attention of our management and other resources. The outcome of the foregoing ongoing matters is inherently uncertain and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in recent years there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious, are time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Some of our suppliers may not provide us with an indemnity for the use of the products and services that these providers supply to us, even if we are exposed to liability for their infringement. At the same time, we generally offer third party intellectual property infringement indemnity to the customers of our Connectivity segment which, in some cases, do not cap our indemnity obligations and thus could render us liable for both defense costs and any judgments. Any of these events could result in increases in our operating expenses, limit our service offerings or result in a loss of business if we are unable to meet our indemnification obligations and our airline customers terminate or fail to renew their contracts.\nRisks Related to Legal, Governmental and Regulatory Matters\nWe may face changes in regulations and difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals to provide our services or to operate our business in particular countries or territorial waters, which could have a material adverse impact on the competitive position, growth and financial performance of our Connectivity segment.\nIn a number of countries where we operate our Connectivity segment, the provision of our services is highly regulated. We may be required to obtain approvals from national and local authorities in connection with most of the telecommunication services that we provide. In many jurisdictions, we must maintain such approvals through compliance with license conditions or payment of annual regulatory fees. For example, many of our Connectivity customers to whom we provide maritime and land products and services utilize our services on mobile vessels or drilling platforms that may enter into new countries on short notice. If we do not already have a license to provide our service in that country or to operate in that country\u2019s territorial waters, if required, we may be required to obtain a license or other regulatory approval on short notice, which may not be feasible in some countries. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could subject us to various sanctions including fines, penalties, arrests or criminal charges, loss of authorizations and the denial of applications for new authorizations or for the renewal of existing authorizations or cause us to delay or terminate our service to such vessel or platform until such license or regulatory approval may be obtained. In some areas of international waters, it is ambiguous as to which country\u2019s regulations apply, if any, and thus difficult and costly for us to determine which licenses or other regulatory approvals we should obtain. In such areas, we could be subject to various penalties or sanctions if we fail to comply with the applicable country\u2019s regulations.\nWe are unable to predict with any certainty the arrival of new or changed regulations from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the products and services we provide in our Connectivity segment, including the operation of satellites, the use of satellite bandwidth, the use of radio spectrum, the licensing of earth stations and other radio transmitters, the provision of communications services, the design, manufacture and marketing of communications systems and networking infrastructure and maritime activity. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of financial penalties against us, the adverse modification or cancellation of required authorizations, or other material adverse actions.\nLaws and regulations affecting our Connectivity segment are subject to change in response to industry developments, new technology, and political considerations. Legislators and regulatory authorities in various countries are considering, and may in the future adopt, new laws, policies and regulations, as well as changes to existing regulations, regarding a variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect our operations or the operations of our distribution partners, increase the cost of providing products and services and make the products and services of our Connectivity segment less competitive in our core markets, including by making it easier or less expensive for competitors to compete with us. In addition, regulation by United States and foreign government agencies, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d), may impair our ability to raise funds from foreign sources. For example, in July 2017, we terminated our investment agreement with Shareco Group of America, Inc. that we had entered into in late 2016 as a result of the parties\u2019 inability to obtain CFIUS approval. For a further description of the Shareco transaction, see \u201c2016 Transactions\u201d under Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\nRegulation by United States government agencies, such as the FAA (which regulates the United States civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries), the FCC (which regulates the United States telecommunications industry), the FTC (which regulates competition and consumer protection) and their foreign equivalents may increase our costs of providing services, may require us to change our services, or-if we are not in compliance with relevant requirements-may lead to costly regulatory enforcement actions against us that can result in the imposition of significant penalties.\nOur Connectivity segment is subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and foreign government agencies. The U.S. government agency that has primary regulatory authority over our operations is the FAA. Similar government agencies in foreign countries also exercise regulatory oversight over our business operations. The commercial and private aviation industries, including civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries, are highly regulated by the FAA. FAA certification is (and similar certification in foreign countries may be) required for all equipment that we install on commercial aircraft, and certain of our operating activities require that we obtain FAA certification or similar foreign certifications as a parts manufacturer. For example, in the United States, FAA approvals required to operate our Connectivity segment include STCs and Parts Manufacturing Authority (\u201cPMAs\u201d). Obtaining STCs and PMAs is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant expenditures of time and resources. Any inability to obtain, delay in obtaining, or change in, needed FAA certifications or their foreign equivalents, authorizations or approvals could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet the installation commitments of our Connectivity segment, to manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or to expand our business and could, therefore, materially adversely affect our growth prospects, business and operating results. If we fail to comply with the many regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose our FAA certifications or their foreign equivalents, authorizations or other approvals on which the\nmanufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance and alteration capabilities of our Connectivity segment rely. In addition, the FAA and other similar government agencies may adopt new regulations or amend existing regulations. These government agencies could also change their policies regarding the delegation of inspection and certification responsibilities to private companies (as opposed to government agencies) (which private companies we currently engage for these services), which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, those new regulations or amendments to existing regulations would generally increase our costs of compliance.\nWe are also subject to the rules and regulations of the FCC and similar rules and regulations in foreign countries. For example, as part of our authorization to provide satellite-based Wi-Fi services in our Connectivity segment, we have licenses from the FCC that obligate us to comply with various technical, operational and service requirements specifically identified in such licenses as well as other rules and regulations promulgated by the FCC. Our enterprise Connectivity business could in the future become subject to the laws and regulations in the United States applicable to mass-market retail providers of broadband Internet access services, and pursuant to an agreement with U.S. federal law enforcement agencies, our Connectivity segment operations must comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (\u201cCALEA\u201d), under which communications carriers and some other service providers must ensure that their equipment, facilities and services can accommodate technical capabilities in executing authorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance. Many non-U.S. countries have similar lawful-intercept requirements. We could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC and other U.S. and foreign telecommunications regulators or law enforcement agencies for our failure to satisfy any of these laws, regulations and commitments, or these laws and regulations may change in a manner adverse to us. This could subject us to fines, cease and desist orders, loss of licenses and other penalties, as well as increased compliance burdens and costs, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are also subject to U.S. federal and state and foreign consumer protection requirements, including data privacy and security requirements and restrictions on international personal-data transfers. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) Act prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that: collect, use, share, or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; have privacy policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the company\u2019s actual practices; and/or fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information. In addition, in mid-2018, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) will take full effect, imposing significant personal-data protection requirements on us and many of our customers and restricting the transfer of personal data outside the European Union. We continue to analyze the GDPR in respect of its burden and applicability to our global business operations. We may fail to comply with any of these requirements, and compliance with these requirements may increase our compliance burden and costs.\nAdverse decisions or regulations of any of the foregoing U.S. and foreign regulators could negatively impact our operations, increase our costs of doing business and potentially expose us to significant liability. We are unable to predict the scope, pace or financial impact of legal, regulatory and policy changes that could be adopted by those entities.\nRegulation by foreign government agencies may increase our costs of providing services or require us to change our services.\nOur Connectivity segment is subject to regulation by regulatory agencies and legislative bodies outside the United States where we do, or in the future may do, business. These foreign bodies may require us to obtain certifications for equipment that we install and certain of our operating activities may require that we obtain foreign regulatory certifications as a parts manufacturer. Obtaining these certifications could be an expensive and time-consuming process requiring significant focus and resources. Adverse decisions or regulations of these foreign government agencies could delay the roll-out of our services and have other adverse consequences for us.\nAny inability to obtain, delay in obtaining, or change in, needed certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet the installation commitments of our Connectivity segment, manufacture and sell parts for installation, or expand our business and could, therefore, materially adversely affect our growth prospects, business and operating results. If we fail to comply with the many foreign regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the foreign certifications, authorizations or other approvals on which the manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance and alteration capabilities of our Connectivity segment are based. In addition, from time to time, the foreign bodies that regulate our activities may adopt new regulations, amend existing regulations or change their policies, all of which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, those new regulations or amendments to existing regulations would generally increase our costs of compliance.\nChanges in government regulation of the Internet, including e-commerce or online video distribution, may cause us to change our Connectivity operations and incur greater operating expenses.\nThe current legal environment for Internet communications, products and services is uncertain and subject to statutory, regulatory or interpretive change. Certain laws and regulations applicable to our Connectivity segment often do not contemplate or address specific issues associated with those technologies, and regulators may disagree with our interpretations of existing laws or regulations or the applicability of existing laws or regulations to our business, and existing laws, regulations and interpretations may change in unexpected ways. We cannot be certain what positions regulators may take regarding our compliance with, or lack of compliance with, current and future legal and regulatory requirements or what positions regulators may take regarding any past or future actions that our Connectivity segment has taken or may take in any jurisdiction. Regulators may determine that we are not in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and impose penalties, or we may need to make changes to our connectivity system, which could be costly and difficult. Our failure, or the failure of our vendors and media partners, customers and others with whom we transact business, to comply with legal or regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe international sales and operations of our business are subject to extensive trade, export, anti-money laundering, foreign corrupt practices and data protection laws.\nWe must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to it include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d), the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) as well as various anti-bribery, anti-corruption and data privacy laws. The export of certain satellite hardware, services and technical data relating to satellites is regulated by the U.S. Department of State under ITAR. Other items are controlled for export by the U.S. Department of Commerce under the EAR. We cannot provide services to certain countries subject to U.S. trade sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from OFAC. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally bars bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. A substantial portion of our business is with airlines and non-governmental organizations, which constitute \u201cgovernment officials\u201d for many anti-bribery laws in many jurisdictions, which could increase the risk of potential anti-corruption compliance issues. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions including fines, onerous compliance requirements, extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of ITAR or the other regulations described above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs we expand our operations to include a physical international presence, or otherwise expand our collection of personally identifiable information of residents in other countries, we may be subject to the data protection regulations of the relevant countries. On April 27, 2016, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), scheduled to take effect on May 25, 2018, which may result in even more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the European Union that process personally identifiable information about European data subjects. In addition, certain countries have laws which restrict the transfer of personally identifiable information outside of such countries. For example, both Switzerland and the member states of the European Union impose restrictions on transferring data to countries that they do not deem to offer a similar standard of protection as they require. The United States is a jurisdiction whose processes these countries do not deem adequate for purposes of cross-border personal data transfers.\nCertain mechanisms apply under European Union member state laws that permit the cross border transfer of personal information to countries that are not deemed adequate, such as the United States. Global Eagle intends to enter into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union to legitimize these transfers. There is a risk that these standard contractual clauses may be invalidated by the Court of Justice for the European Union as a lawful data transfer mechanism on the grounds that they do not provide adequate protection of European data subjects\u2019 personally identifiable information. There is also a risk that EU data protection authorities may investigate or bring enforcement actions with criminal and administrative sanctions. Such actions could also damage our business and harm our reputation.\nWe have been subject to civil stockholder litigation involving allegations that certain of our investor disclosures were false or misleading. We may be subject to additional similar litigation in the future.\nWe and certain of our former officers and directors were named as defendants in certain purported stockholder class action lawsuits. Specifically, on February 23, 2017 and on March 17, 2017, following the Company\u2019s announcement that it anticipated a delay in its 2016 Form 10-K filing and that its former CEO Dave Davis and former CFO Tom Severson would separate from the Company, three putative securities class action lawsuits were filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California. These lawsuits allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act against the Company, Mr.\nDavis, Mr. Severson and Michael Zemetra (who was our CFO prior to Mr. Severson). The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed two of these lawsuits. The third lawsuit, brought by putative stockholder M&M Hart Living Trust and Randi Williams (the \u201cHart complaint\u201d), alleges that the Company and the other Defendants made misrepresentations and/or omitted material information about the EMC Acquisition in July 2016, the Company\u2019s projected financial performance and synergies following that acquisition, and the impact of that acquisition on the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On November 2, 2017, the Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Hart complaint, and dismissed the action with prejudice. The plaintiffs may appeal that ruling, and their period in which to appeal has not yet expired.\nWe incurred costs to defend such lawsuits and may in the future incur additional costs to defend and/or settle similar matters. In addition, although all of these lawsuits have now been dismissed, these rulings remain subject to appeal, and we may be required to pay substantial damages in connection with these matters. Further, these lawsuits (if any rulings are appealed) may divert the attention of our management and consume other resources. Our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance may not be adequate to cover our obligations to indemnify our directors and officers, fund a settlement of these lawsuits or pay an adverse judgment. We are currently unable to estimate the possible loss or possible range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits, in part because the outcome of the foregoing ongoing matters is inherently uncertain. An unfavorable outcome from the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, future cash flows or future reputation.\nIn addition to the lawsuits described above, we and our current and/or former officers and directors may face additional suits from stockholders in the future. Any such suits may similarly cause us to incur substantial costs, result in management distraction, and expose us to significant damages. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any such litigation, and any adverse outcome of such cases could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nOur potential indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance could result in significant legal expenses or damages and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nBoth current and former officers and members of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), as individual defendants, could be the subject of lawsuits related to the Company. Under Delaware law, our bylaws and certain indemnification agreements, we may have an obligation to indemnify both current and former officers and directors in relation to these matters. If the Company incurs significant uninsured indemnity obligations, our indemnity obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and subjects us to various reporting and financial covenants that we may be unable to comply with and the failure to remain in compliance with those covenants could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe currently have a significant amount of indebtedness and could in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our substantial debt combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, as well as significant expenses in connection with our Finance department restructuring and efforts to remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could have significant adverse consequences on our business. For example:\n\u2022\nIf we fail to meet payment obligations or otherwise default under our debt, the lenders will have the right to accelerate the indebtedness and exercise other rights and remedies against us. We do not expect that we could repay all of our outstanding indebtedness if the repayment of such indebtedness was accelerated.\n\u2022\nWe are required to comply with financial covenants that require us to maintain maximum leverage ratios which decrease on a quarterly basis.\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements could be limited. If we are unable to raise additional capital if required, it could affect our liquidity, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, our ability to borrow additional amounts under our revolving credit facility, which is a significant source of liquidity, is subject to the absence of defaults and our ability to make certain representations and warranties. Failure to meet our borrowing conditions under our revolving credit facility could materially and adversely impact our liquidity.\n\u2022\nOur debt imposes operating and financial covenants and restrictions on us, and compliance with such covenants and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to adequately finance our operations or capital needs, pursue attractive\nbusiness opportunities that may arise, redeem or repurchase capital stock, pay dividends, sell assets, and make capital expenditures.\n\u2022\nOur failure to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement, which include covenants requiring us to timely file our audited and unaudited financial statements, could result in an event of default on our debt. In May, June, September and October 2017, we entered into amendments and limited waivers to our credit agreement due to our inability to timely file this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Q1 Form 10-Q, Q2 Form 10-Q and Q3 Form 10-Q, resulting in, among other things, additional financial and disclosure covenants under the credit agreement and increased interest costs and amendment fees associated with our debt. Upon an event of default, the lenders of that debt could elect to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to become immediately due and payable and we would be unable to access our revolving credit facility. An event of default could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\n\u2022\nWe could experience increased vulnerability to, and limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry, creating competitive disadvantages compared to other competitors with lower debt levels and borrowing costs.\n\u2022\nWe could experience increased vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates if our borrowings bear interest at variable rates or if such indebtedness is refinanced at a time when interest rates are higher.\nWe intend to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations with our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and if required, funds from external sources. However, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay the amounts due under our existing debt. Funds from external sources may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under our debt instruments as a result of an event of default, including upon a failure to pay any amount due or upon an acceleration event on our other debt instruments (such as on our convertible notes described below), we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness or to make any accelerated payments.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could cause the related risks to intensify. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before their respective maturities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The terms of any new debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than are currently in place.\nWe may not have the ability to repay the principal amount of our convertible notes at maturity, to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our convertible notes or to repurchase our convertible notes upon a fundamental change or on specified repurchase dates, and the agreements governing our future indebtedness may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase our convertible notes.\nAs of September 30, 2017, we had outstanding approximately $82.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 (the \u201cconvertible notes\u201d). At maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of our convertible notes will become due and payable by us. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (including among other things, if our common stock ceases to be listed or quoted on Nasdaq) or upon each of February 20, 2022, February 22, 2025 and February 22, 2030, holders of convertible notes will also have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of our convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of our convertible notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of our convertible notes being converted. However, we may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repay the principal amount of our convertible notes, make repurchases of our convertible notes or settle conversions of our convertible notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase our convertible notes may be limited by law, regulatory action or agreements governing our indebtedness.\nFurthermore, certain transactions or events that would give holders of our convertible notes the right to put our convertible notes back to us or to convert our convertible notes with an increased conversion rate may constitute events of default under our credit agreement. Our failure to repay the principal amount of our convertible notes, repurchase convertible notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture (including, among other things, if our common stock ceases to be listed or quoted on Nasdaq), or to settle conversions of our convertible notes would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under our other debt agreements (such as our credit agreement) or agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase our convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversion thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of our convertible notes is triggered (including, among other things, if our common stock ceases to be listed or quoted on Nasdaq), holders of convertible notes will be entitled to convert our convertible notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their convertible notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which may result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of our convertible notes because they may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects our economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for our convertible notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of our convertible notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current period presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of our convertible notes to their face amount over the term of our convertible notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of our convertible notes.\nIn addition, because our convertible notes may be settled entirely or partly in cash, under certain circumstances, our convertible notes are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of our convertible notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nThe fundamental change repurchase feature of the indenture governing our convertible notes may increase the price of or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nThe indenture governing our convertible notes requires us to repurchase our convertible notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover may trigger the requirement that we repurchase our convertible notes and/or increase the conversion rate, which could make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in a combinatory transaction with us. Such additional costs may have the effect of preventing a Company takeover that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nConversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of our convertible notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of our convertible notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or any anticipated conversion of our convertible notes into shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of our convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of our convertible notes could be used to satisfy short positions.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe are currently not compliant with Nasdaq rules. Although Nasdaq has granted us an extension to become compliant, if we are unable to satisfy the terms of that extension, Nasdaq may determine to delist our common stock. A delisting would give rise to a repurchase obligation under the indenture for our convertible notes and could have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nBeginning in May 2017, we received several notifications from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC stating that we are in continued noncompliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because we have not yet filed our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 and for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017 (the \u201c2017 Quarterly Reports\u201d) and remained delinquent in filing our 2016 Form 10-K. We expect to receive a similar non-compliance notice in November 2017 in respect of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2017. Following discussions with Nasdaq, we were given an extension until September 12, 2017 to make these filings. When we failed to do so by that deadline, the Listing Qualifications Department sent us a notice (on September 13, 2017) that it had determined to delist our securities. We had an appeals hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel relating to this determination on October 26, 2017, and on November 3, 2017, Nasdaq granted our requested extension to regain compliance with its listing rules. Under the extension, we had until November 30, 2017 to file this Form 10-K and now have until January 31, 2018 to file our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2017. If we are unable to meet these extended deadlines for our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, or due to any other non-compliance with Nasdaq rules, then Nasdaq may decide to delist our securities.\nIf our common stock ceases to be listed or quoted on Nasdaq, this would constitute a \u201cfundamental change\u201d, as defined in the indenture governing our convertible notes, pursuant to which the holders of convertible notes would have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of our convertible notes to be repurchased. We may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain financing if we are required to repurchase the convertible notes, which could cause us to default under the indenture. A default under the indenture would also cause a default under our credit agreement, which could cause all outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement to become immediately due and payable.\nIn addition, a delisting and/or trading suspension of our securities from Nasdaq would negatively impact us because it could, among other things: (i) reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock; (ii) reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) limit our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing us from accessing the public capital markets; (iv) impair our ability to provide liquid equity incentives to our employees; and (v) have negative reputational impact for us with our customers, suppliers, employees and other persons with whom we transact from time to time.\nThe delayed filing of some of our periodic SEC reports has made us currently ineligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nAs a result of the delayed filing of our periodic reports with the SEC, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 until late 2018, at the earliest. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are eligible to use Form S-3, both our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction quickly and successfully, and as a result potentially harming our financial condition.\nThe interests of our largest stockholders may conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders.\nBased on the information available to us, PAR Investment Partners, L.P. (\u201cPAR\u201d) beneficially owned approximately 31.9% of our outstanding common stock as of October 31, 2017, and was our largest stockholder on that date; entities affiliated with ABRY Partners beneficially owned approximately 10.6% of our outstanding common stock as of that date; and entities affiliated with Frontier Capital Management Co. beneficially owned approximately 8.3% of our outstanding common stock as of that date. As such, our shares are highly concentrated within a limited group of institutional stockholders. Our largest stockholders may have the ability to influence the election of our directors and the outcome of corporate actions of the Company requiring stockholder approval, including approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The interests of these stockholders may conflict with our interests or those of other stockholders.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and may decline as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on an investment in our securities, and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price that you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline. Due to various factors, the trading price of our securities over the last 24 months has experienced a notable decline. Factors that may affect the trading price of our securities in the future may include:\n\u2022\nour inability to timely file our SEC reports;\n\u2022\nour material weaknesses in our internal controls;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial results or the financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u2022\nour inability to consummate beneficial investment and M&A transactions, including due to our inability to obtain any required regulatory or national security approvals;\n\u2022\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the Company, the market for in-flight entertainment, the airline industry, or the travel market in general;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nour ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business or our industry;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nany major change in our Board or management; and\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities and credit-ratings analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If insufficient securities or industry analysts cover us, our stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts covering us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWarrants currently exercisable for our common stock could significantly increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOutstanding warrants purchasing an aggregate of 6,173,228 shares of our common stock are exercisable for a like number of shares of our common stock. These warrants have a five-year term and will expire in January 31, 2018. The exercise price of these warrants is $11.50 per share. To the extent that such warrants are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of common stock of the Company and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the common stock equals or exceeds $17.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption, provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time that we redeem the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. A registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants was declared effective by the SEC on August 22, 2013, but has been suspended due to our failure to be current in our periodic reporting obligations. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force warrant holders (i) to exercise warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so, (ii) to sell warrants at the then-current market price when a holder might otherwise wish to hold such warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of such holder\u2019s warrants.\nIn addition, the warrant agreement for the warrants provides that the terms thereof may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding warrants sold as part of the units in our initial public offering to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding warrants sold as part of the units in our initial public offering approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur charter and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified Board with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that an annual meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer, or the Board, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding the Board with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings of stockholders and to cancel previously scheduled annual meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by stockholders only for cause; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe may issue additional equity or convertible debt securities in the future, which may result in additional dilution to investors.\nTo the extent that any of our convertible notes are converted into shares of common stock or we need to raise additional capital in the future and we issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock, our then existing stockholders may experience dilution and the new securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock offered. In addition, to the extent we settle the conversion of the convertible notes with shares of our common stock, such conversion would be dilutive to our current stockholders. The conversion of a significant amount of our convertible notes, if settled in shares, could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock, which could adversely affect your ability to sell your shares in the market or our ability to raise capital in the future or both. Our charter authorizes our Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our stockholders. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, liquidation rights or voting rights. If we issue preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12792, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "GEENQ"}
