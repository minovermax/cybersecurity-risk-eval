{"cik": "1007587", "company": "KVH INDUSTRIES INC \\DE\\", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business. If any of these risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not significant, develops into an actual event, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks related to our financial performance\nWe have a history of losses and are uncertain when we may regain profitability.\nWe recorded substantial losses from continuing operations in each of the last three fiscal years. We expect to incur substantial losses in the near future as we confront the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, as we continue to bear the expenses of maintaining two satellite networks during the transition of our mini-VSAT customers to our HTS network, as we increase satellite capacity to handle our growing subscriber base, as we continue to shift our business from a model based primarily on product sales to a model based primarily on recurring revenue, and as we continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing products and develop new products, including our photonic chip-based fiber optic gyro. We expect to invest substantially in the development of our photonic chip-based fiber optic gyro in an effort to take advantage of opportunities we may have in the autonomous vehicle and other markets. We expect that, as we increase our investments in these and other areas, including, for example, our Internet of Things (IoT) product, our losses will grow. In order to regain profitability, we must successfully complete the transition of our mini-VSAT customers to our HTS network and continue to introduce new and improved products in order to maintain and improve our competitive position and generate revenue. Our inability to accomplish any of these goals could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and cash flow, and we cannot assure you when, or whether, we will regain profitability.\nFluctuations in our quarterly net sales and results of operations could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur future net sales and results of operations could continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Accordingly, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that our net sales or results of operations in a quarter will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the market price of our common stock could fall significantly. Our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate for many reasons, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; changes in demand for our products and services, the timing and size of individual orders from military customers, which may be delayed or canceled for various reasons; the mix of products and services we sell, including the mix of fixed rate and metered contracts for airtime services; our ability to manufacture, test and deliver products in a timely and cost-effective manner, including the availability of components and subassemblies from our suppliers; our success in winning competitions for orders; the timing of new product introductions by us or our competitors; the scope and success of our investments in research and development; expenses incurred in pursuing acquisitions and investments; expenses incurred in expanding, maintaining, or improving our mini-VSAT Broadband network; market and competitive pricing pressures; unanticipated charges or expenses, such as increases in warranty claims; general economic climate; and seasonality of pleasure boat and recreational vehicle usage.\nIn light of our current and anticipated investments in research and development and the expansion of our HTS network, we expect that our operating expenses in upcoming quarters may increase significantly over the amounts we incurred in prior comparable quarters.\nA large portion of our expenses, including expenses for network infrastructure, facilities, equipment, and personnel, are relatively fixed. Accordingly, if our net sales decline or do not grow as much or as quickly as we anticipate, we might be unable to maintain or improve our operating margins. Any failure to achieve anticipated net sales could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period.\nAdditional impairments to goodwill or other intangible assets could result in significant charges against earnings.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded, and may continue to record, a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. In 2020, our annual impairment test resulted in an impairment charge of $10.5 million in our KVH Media reporting unit. Even after recording this impairment, our consolidated balance sheet continues to include $8.8 million of goodwill and other intangible assets, of which $4.4 million relates to KVH Media Group. There can be no assurance that our remaining goodwill and other intangible assets will not be further impaired, especially if the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the markets in which we participate.\nRisks related to our operations\nWe must generate a certain level of sales of the TracPhone V-HTS series products and our mini-VSAT Broadband service in order to maintain or improve our service gross margins.\nAs a result of our mini-VSAT Broadband network infrastructure, our cost of service sales includes certain costs that do not generally vary directly in proportion with the volume of service sales, and we have almost no ability to reduce these fixed costs in the short term. These costs have increased significantly each year as we have further expanded our network to accommodate additional subscriber demand and/or coverage areas, and we expect that this trend will continue in 2021 and beyond, particularly as we expand our HTS network. If sales of our TracPhone V-HTS series products and the mini-VSAT Broadband service, including through our AgilePlans subscription model, do not generate the level of revenue that we expect or if those revenues decline, our service gross margins may continue to decline. The failure to improve our mini-VSAT Broadband service gross margins and unit or subscriber sales would have a material adverse effect on our overall profitability.\nThe operation of our HTS and legacy satellite networks is causing us to incur significant additional operating costs that adversely affect our operating profit.\nIn November 2017, we launched our HTS communications service that uses Intelsat\u2019s Global IntelsatOne Flex managed services and SKY-Perfect JSAT capacity. We also continue to operate our legacy global network of leased satellite transponders and terrestrial teleports in cooperation with ViaSat, Inc. The operation of both the HTS network and the legacy network has resulted and will continue to result in significant additional operating costs. Our arrangement with ViaSat is currently scheduled to expire in 2021. We expect that the arrangement with ViaSat and related satellite operators will be phased out by the end of 2021, but the reliability of the existing satellite network will need to be maintained during the entirety of the wind-down period. Our focus on the HTS network creates potential risks with respect to the continued operation of our legacy satellite communications network and our contractual arrangement with ViaSat and satellite operators.\nWe expect to terminate our legacy satellite network by the end of 2021, which may result in a loss of business from customers who are unable or unwilling to convert to our HTS network.\nOur maritime airtime services networks generated approximately $81.4 million of revenue in 2020. At the end of 2020, approximately 38% of our maritime airtime subscribers relied on our legacy airtime network. We intend to provide various incentives to these customers, such as free or discounted upgrade kits and terminals, to entice them to convert their service to our HTS network by the end of 2021. Our inability to convert our legacy satellite customers to our HTS network could result in the loss of revenue. In addition, the costs that we may need to incur to convert our legacy maritime airtime customers to our HTS network may be significant. There can be no assurance that we will retain our legacy airtime customers when we terminate our legacy network at the end of 2021 or that the costs we incur to convert these customers result in profitability either in the short term or the long term.\nOur ability to compete in the maritime airtime services market will be impaired if we are unable to provide sufficient service capacity to meet customer demand.\nWe currently offer our mini-VSAT Broadband service in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Australian and New Zealand waters. We may need to expand capacity in existing coverage areas to support our subscriber base. If we are unable to reach economical agreements with third-party satellite providers to support our mini-VSAT Broadband service and its technology or if transponder capacity is unavailable to meet growing demand in a given region, our ability to provide airtime services will be at risk and could reduce the attractiveness of our products and services.\nOur results of operations are adversely affected by unseasonably cold weather, prolonged winter conditions, disasters or similar events.\nOur leisure marine business is highly seasonal, and seasonality can also impact our commercial marine business. Historically, we have generated the majority of our leisure marine product revenues during the first and second quarters of each year, and these revenues typically decline in the third and fourth quarters of each year, compared to the first two quarters. Temporary suspensions of our airtime services typically increase in the third and fourth quarters of each year as boats are placed out of service during winter months. Our leisure marine business is also significantly affected by the weather. Unseasonably cool weather, prolonged winter conditions, hurricanes, unusual amounts of rain, and natural and other disasters may decrease boating, which could reduce our revenues. Specifically, we may encounter a decrease in new airtime activations as well as an increase in the number of cancellations or temporary suspensions of our airtime service.\nWe have single dedicated manufacturing facilities for each of our mobile connectivity and inertial navigation product categories, and any significant disruption to a facility will impair our ability to deliver our products.\nWe currently manufacture all of our mobile connectivity products at our manufacturing facility in Middletown, Rhode Island, and the majority of our inertial navigation products at our facility in Tinley Park, Illinois. Some of our production processes are complex, and we may be unable to respond rapidly to the loss of the use of either production facility. For example, our production facilities use some specialized equipment that may take time to replace if they are damaged or become unusable for any reason. In that event, shipments would be delayed, which could result in customer or dealer dissatisfaction, loss of sales and damage to our reputation. Finally, we have only a limited capability to increase our manufacturing capacity in the short term. If short-term demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, our inability to fulfill orders in a timely manner could also lead to customer or dealer dissatisfaction, loss of sales and damage to our reputation.\nAcquisitions may disrupt our operations or adversely affect our results.\nWe evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses as they arise. The expenses we incur evaluating and pursuing acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we acquire a business, we may be unable to manage it profitably or successfully integrate its operations with our own. Moreover, we may be unable to realize the strategic, financial, operational and other benefits we anticipate, and any acquisition may increase our operating expenses. Further, our approach to acquisitions may involve a number of special financial and business risks, such as entry into new and unfamiliar lines of business or markets, which may present challenges or risks that we did not anticipate; entry into new or unfamiliar geographic regions, including exposure to additional tax and regulatory regimes; increased expenses associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets; increased exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; charges related to any abandoned acquisition; diversion of our management\u2019s time, attention, and resources; loss of key acquired personnel; increased costs to improve or coordinate managerial, operational, financial, and administrative systems, including internal control over financial reporting; dilutive issuances of equity securities; the assumption of legal liabilities; and losses arising from impairment charges associated with goodwill or intangible assets.\nIf we cannot effectively manage changes in our rate of growth, our business may suffer.\nWe have previously expanded our operations to pursue existing and potential market opportunities, and we are continuing to expand our international operations. For example, we expanded our service offerings through acquisitions in 2014 and in 2013. This growth placed a strain on our personnel, management, financial and other resources and increased our operating expenses. If we are unable to adjust our operating expenses on a timely basis in response to changes in revenue cycles, our results of operations may be harmed. To manage changes in our rate of growth effectively, we must, among other things, match our manufacturing facilities and capacity to demand for our products and services; secure appropriate satellite capacity to match changes in demand for airtime services; successfully attract, train, motivate and manage appropriate numbers of employees for manufacturing, sales, and customer support activities; effectively manage our inventory and working capital; and ensure that\nour procedures and internal controls are revised and updated to remain appropriate for the size and scale of our business operations.\nIf we are unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel we need to expand our operations, our business will suffer.\nTo meet our growth objectives, we must attract and retain highly skilled technical, operational, managerial and sales and marketing personnel. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, we may be unable to achieve our business objectives and may lose our competitive position, which could lead to a significant decline in net sales. We face significant competition for these skilled professionals.\nOur success depends on the services of our executive officers.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills and efforts of Martin Kits van Heyningen, our co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board, and of Brent Bruun, our Chief Operating Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. If we lost the services of Mr. Kits van Heyningen or Mr. Bruun, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. We also depend on the ability of our other executive officers to work effectively as a team. The loss of one or more of our executive officers could impair our ability to manage our business effectively.\nRisks related to our dependence on technology and third parties\nOur mobile satellite products currently depend on satellite services, gateway teleports and terrestrial networks provided by third parties, and a disruption in those services could adversely affect sales.\nOur satellite antenna products include the equipment necessary to utilize satellite services. We do not own the satellites that directly provide two-way satellite communications or the terrestrial networks that interconnect our facilities with the satellite teleports that communicate with the satellites. We currently offer satellite television products compatible with the DIRECTV and DISH Network services in the United States, the Bell TV service in Canada, the Sky Mexico service in Mexico, the Sky UK service in the United Kingdom, Canal+ service in France and Movistar service in Spain and various other regional satellite TV services in other parts of the world.\nSES, Eutelsat, Sky Perfect-JSAT, Telesat, EchoStar, Intelsat and Star One currently provide the satellite capacity to support the mini-VSAT Broadband service and our TracPhone V-IP and V-HTS series products. In addition, we have agreements with various teleports and Internet service providers around the globe to support the mini-VSAT Broadband service. The terrestrial fiber links that we use to connect with the Internet and to move our voice and data services between our facilities and the various satellite earth stations that support our services are provided to us through numerous service providers, some of which have contractual relationships with our satellite service providers and not directly with us. We rely on Inmarsat for satellite communications services for our FleetBroadband and FleetOne compatible TracPhone products. We also have an arrangement with Iridium for additional satellite communications services that we make available to our customers as a backup option to provide communications redundancy with our primary service offerings.\nWe exercise little or no control over these third-party providers of satellite, teleport and terrestrial network services, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. Due to our reliance on these service providers, when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Service disruption or outages, regardless of whether they are caused by our service, the equipment or services of our third-party service providers, or our customers\u2019 or their equipment and systems, may result in loss of market acceptance of our service, and any necessary repairs or other remedial actions may cause us to incur significant costs and expenses. Any failure on the part of third-party service providers to achieve or maintain expected performance levels, stability and security could harm our relationships with our customers, result in claims for credits or damages, damage our reputation, significantly reduce customer demand for our solution and seriously harm our financial condition and operating results.\nIf customers become dissatisfied with the programming, pricing, service, availability or other aspects of any of these satellite services, or if any one or more of these services becomes unavailable for any reason, we could suffer a substantial decline in sales of our satellite products. There may be no alternative service provider available in a particular geographic area, and our modem or other technology may not be compatible with the technology of any alternative service provider that may be available. Even if available, delays caused by switching our technology to another service provider, if available, and qualifying this new service provider could materially harm our customer relationships, business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, the unexpected failure of a satellite could disrupt the availability of programming and services, which could reduce the demand for, or customer satisfaction with, our products.\nWe depend on cloud-based data services operated by third parties, and any disruption in the operation of these services could harm our business.\nSome of our content services and business records are hosted by various cloud-based data services operated by third parties. Any failure or downtime in one of these services could affect a significant percentage of our customers. Although we control and have access to our servers and the components of our network that are located in our internal facilities and certain of our external data facilities, we do not control the operation of external facilities. The providers of our data management services have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one or more of our data management service providers is acquired, closes, suffers financial difficulty or is unable to meet our growing capacity needs, we may be required to transfer our data to other services, and we may incur significant costs and service interruptions in connection with doing so, which could harm our reputation with our customers and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nOur media and entertainment business relies on licensing arrangements with content providers, and the loss of, or changes in, those arrangements could adversely affect our business.\nWe distribute premium news, sports, movies, and music content for commercial and leisure customers in the maritime, hotel, and retail markets. We license this content from third parties on a non-exclusive basis without long-term license agreements. Any content provider could terminate our arrangements without notice or could adversely modify the terms of the arrangement, including price increases. Further, the licenses we obtain are limited in scope, and any violation of the terms of a license could expose us to liability for copyright infringement. We pay license fees based in part on the revenue we generate from sublicenses, and our licensors generally have the right to audit our records. Failure to pay required license fees could result in termination of our license rights, penalties and damages. The loss of content could adversely affect the attractiveness of our media and entertainment offerings, which could in turn adversely affect our revenues. Any increase in the cost of content could reduce the profitability of these offerings.\nCybersecurity breaches could disrupt our operations, expose us to liability, damage our reputation, and require us to incur significant costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and third-party systems, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information, including personal information of our customers. We also retain sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, personally identifiable information, credit card information, and usage data of our employees and customers on our computer networks and those of third parties. Although we take certain protective measures and endeavor to modify them as we believe circumstances warrant, invasive technologies and techniques continue to evolve rapidly, and increasingly sophisticated hacking organizations are targeting business systems. As a result, the computer systems, software and networks that we use are vulnerable to disruption, shutdown, unauthorized access, misuse, erasure, alteration, employee error, phishing, computer viruses, ransomware or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. The protective measures on which we rely may be inadequate to prevent or detect cybersecurity breaches or determine the extent of any breach, and there can be no assurance that undetected breaches have not already occurred. If any of these events were to occur, they could disrupt our operations, distract our management, cause us to lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers, as well as subject us to regulatory actions, litigation, fines, damage to our reputation or competitive position, or orders or decrees requiring us to modify our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks related to economic conditions and trade relations\nOur revenues, results of operations and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by economic turmoil, political events, macroeconomic conditions, credit tightening and associated declines in consumer and enterprise spending, and by the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEconomic conditions in the various geographic markets we serve have experienced significant turmoil over the last several years, including downturns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, slow economic activity, tight credit markets, inflation and deflation concerns, low consumer confidence, limited capital spending, adverse business conditions, war and refugee crises in the Middle East and Europe, terrorist attacks, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, changes in government priorities, trade wars, a government shutdown, gridlock from a divided Congress, and liquidity concerns. These factors vary in intensity by region. Further, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented, revised, withdrawn, reinstituted and expanded extensive safety precautions, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures. Other organizations and individuals continue to take additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and implementing work-at-home policies. These measures have significantly\ndisrupted normal business operations both in and outside of affected areas and complying with them has increased our costs. Travel restrictions and safety precautions have also limited our ability to service and install our equipment. Although we are unable to predict the ongoing impact of the pandemic, our mobile communications business in particular largely depends on travel. The operations of our KVH Media Group have been particularly impacted due in part to the global reduction in travel resulting from the pandemic. We anticipate that, until the pandemic is contained, governmental, individual, business and other organizational measures to limit the spread of the virus will continue to adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition, perhaps materially. An outbreak of infection in any of our facilities could severely disrupt our operations. We continue to monitor government recommendations and have made modifications to our operations because of the pandemic. Our customers\u2019 businesses could be further disrupted, and our revenues could continue to be adversely affected. Additionally, global economic disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our supply chain and cause delays in the delivery of raw materials, components and other supplies that we need to conduct our operations. The extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our business will depend on many factors beyond our control, including the speed of contagion, the development and implementation of effective preventative measures and vaccines, the scope of governmental and other restrictions on travel and other activity, and public reactions to these factors.\nThere can be no assurances that government programs to maintain or improve economic conditions, including stimulus and other aid programs intended to combat the impact of the pandemic, will be effective. As a result of these and other factors, customers and government entities could continue to slow or suspend spending on our products and services. We may also incur increased credit losses and need to further increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would have a negative impact on our earnings and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict the timing, duration, or ultimate impact of the turmoil in our markets. We expect our business to continue to be adversely impacted by this turmoil, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, to varying degrees and for varying amounts of time, in all our geographic markets.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international trade relations, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe change in U.S. presidential administrations may alter the U.S.\u2019s approach to international trade, which may impact existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements and treaties with foreign countries. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods and may increase tariffs or impose new ones, and certain foreign governments have retaliated and may continue to do so. We derive a majority of our revenues from international sales, which makes us especially vulnerable to increased tariffs. Changes in U.S. trade policy have created ongoing turmoil in international trade relations, and it is unclear what future actions the U.S. government or foreign governments will or will not take with respect to tariffs or other international trade agreements and policies. Current trade negotiations may fail, which may exacerbate these risks. Ongoing or new trade wars or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies could reduce demand for our products and services, increase our costs, reduce our profitability, adversely impact our supply chain or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of the scope of our foreign sales and foreign operations, we face significant exposure to movements in exchange rates for foreign currencies, particularly the pound sterling and the euro. During 2019 and 2020, the U.S. dollar strengthened slightly against certain foreign currencies, which adversely affected revenues reported in U.S. dollars and decreased the reported value of our assets in foreign countries. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen (as has recently occurred relative to the pound sterling), our revenues denominated in foreign currencies but reported in U.S. dollars, as well as the reported value of our assets in foreign countries, would be commensurately lower.\nWe also have intragroup receivables and liabilities, such as loans, that can generate significant foreign currency effects. Changes in exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling, could lead to the recognition of unrealized foreign exchange losses.\nMoreover, certain of our products and services are sold internationally in U.S. dollars; if the U.S. dollar strengthens, the relative cost of these products and services to customers located in foreign countries would increase, which could adversely affect export sales. In addition, most of our financial obligations, including payments under our outstanding debt obligations, must be satisfied in U.S. dollars. Our exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates may change over time as our business practices evolve and could result in increased costs or reduced revenue and could adversely affect our cash flow. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and may have a significant impact on our operating results. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can cost-effectively mitigate this exposure.\nRisks related to government sales\nOur financial performance is impacted by U.S. government contracts, which are subject to uncertain levels of funding and termination\nWe are unable to predict the impact on our business of Congressional gridlock, tax reform and government policies, including new expenditures to address the COVID-19 pandemic, which have increased already significant budget deficits and may lead to an overall reduction in federal spending on programs important to our business. A reduction in sales to the U.S. government or its contractors, whether due to lack of funding, for convenience or otherwise, or the occurrence of delays, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe purchasing and delivery schedules and priorities of the U.S. military, government contractors and foreign governments are often unpredictable and subject to uncertain levels of funding and termination.\nWe have historically sold a substantial portion of our TACNAV and FOG products and services to the U.S. government and its contractors as well as foreign military and government customers, either directly or as a subcontractor to other contractors. These customers often use a competitive bidding process and have unique purchasing and delivery requirements, which often makes the timing of sales to these customers unpredictable. Factors that affect their purchasing and delivery decisions include increasing budgetary pressures, which may reduce or delay funding for military programs; changes in modernization plans for military equipment; changes in tactical navigation requirements; global conflicts impacting troop deployment, including troop withdrawals; priorities for current battlefield operations; new military and operational doctrines that affect military equipment needs; sales cycles that are long and difficult to predict; shifting response time and/or delays in the approval process associated with the export licenses we must obtain prior to the international shipment of certain of our military products; delays in military procurement schedules; and delays in the testing and acceptance of our products, including delays resulting from changes in customer specifications.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract without prior notice, at the government's convenience or for default based on performance. Government customers can also decline to exercise previously disclosed contract options. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor.\nThese factors periodically cause substantial fluctuations in sales of our TACNAV and FOG products and services. Fluctuating commercial sales of our inertial navigation products are also making it harder to predict our future revenues. For example, TACNAV product sales increased $6.1 million, or 125%, from 2019 to 2020, while sales of our FOG products remained flat between 2019 and 2020.\nSales of our FOG systems and TACNAV products generally consist of a few large orders, and the delay or cancellation of a single order will substantially reduce our net sales. Only a few customers account for a substantial portion of our inertial navigation revenues, and the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce our net sales.\nWe derive a significant portion of our inertial navigation revenues from a small number of customers, many of whom are contractors for the U.S. government. KVH products sold to these customers are purchased through orders that can generally range in size from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars. For example, we received an order for $10.0 million of TACNAV products in July 2020, an order for $4.0 million of FOG products in October 2019 and orders for $6.7 million and $3.5 million of TACNAV products and services in September 2019 and April 2017, respectively. Orders of this size are often unpredictable and difficult to replicate. As a result, the delay or cancellation of a single order could materially reduce our net sales and results of operations. We routinely experience repeated and unanticipated delays in defense orders, which make our revenues and operating results less predictable. Because our inertial navigation products typically have relatively higher product gross margins than our mobile connectivity products, the loss of an order for inertial navigation products could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks related to our industry\nCompetition may limit our ability to sell our mobile connectivity products and services and inertial navigation products.\nThe mobile connectivity markets and defense navigation and inertial navigation markets are very competitive, and we expect this competition to intensify. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, which could\nimpair our ability to sell our products and services. For example, improvements in the performance of lower-cost gyros by competitors could jeopardize sales of our FOGs and FOG-based systems. As our market share in the mobile satellite communication market has grown, competition has intensified significantly, most notably from companies that seek to compete primarily on price. These companies may continue to implement price reductions and discounts for both products and services, which have required us to reduce our prices or offer discounts in order to maintain or increase our market share. Some of our VSAT competitors have also leveraged partnerships amongst themselves in order to capture larger combined market share. Further, some of the companies that we depend on to supply us with capacity on satellite communications networks may vertically integrate by introducing their own products and services to compete with ours, which might motivate them to stop providing satellite network capacity to us, or to make it available only on less favorable terms.\nIn the marine market for satellite TV equipment, we compete primarily with Intellian, Cobham SATCOM, Orbit Communication Systems, Raymarine (Intellian made), KNS, and Sea King (King Controls). In the marine market for voice, fax, data, and Internet communications equipment, we compete primarily with Intellian, Cobham SATCOM, Orbit Communication Systems, Jotron AS, KNS Inc., Inmarsat, AddValue, and Iridium Satellite LLC. In the marine market for high-speed voice, fax, data, and Internet services, we compete primarily with Inmarsat, Marlink, Speedcast, Network Innovations, Global Eagle Entertainment and Isotropic Network. We also face competition from providers of low-speed data services, which include Inmarsat, Globalstar LP, and Iridium Satellite LLC. In the market for land mobile satellite TV equipment, we compete primarily with King Controls and Winegard Company. In the markets for media content, the KVH Media Group competes primarily with Swank Motion Pictures and NewspaperDirect Inc. In the inertial navigation markets, we compete primarily with Honeywell International Inc., Northrop Grumman Corporation, Goodrich Aerospace, IAI, Fizoptica, SAGEM, and Systron Donner Inertial. Many of our competitors are well-established companies that have substantially greater financial, managerial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may help them to compete more effectively against us.\nThe emergence of a competing small maritime VSAT antenna and complementary service or other similar service could reduce the competitive advantage we believe we currently enjoy with our smaller TracPhone V-HTS series antennas and Ku-band mini-VSAT Broadband service, or with our TracPhone V11-HTS antenna and our C/Ku-band mini-VSAT Broadband service.\nOur TracPhone V-HTS and V-IP systems offer customers a range of benefits due to their integrated design, hardware costs that are lower than existing maritime Ku-band VSAT systems, and broadband technology. We currently compete against companies that offer established maritime Ku-band VSAT service using, in some cases, antennas 1-meter in diameter or larger. While we are unaware of any company offering a 37-cm VSAT solution comparable to our TracPhone V3-HTS, we are encountering regional competition from companies offering 60-cm VSAT systems and services, which are comparable in size to our TracPhone V7-HTS. Likewise, our TracPhone V11-HTS, at 1.1-meters in diameter, is approximately 85% smaller and lighter than competing C-band maritime VSAT systems, which use antennas in excess of 2.4-meters in diameter to provide similar global services. We are unaware of any competitor currently offering a similar size solution for global C-band coverage, but any introduction of such a product could adversely impact our success. In addition, other companies could replicate some of the distinguishing features of our TracPhone V-HTS series products, which could potentially reduce the appeal of our solution, increase price competition, and adversely affect sales. We compete against Inmarsat's Fleet Xpress service, a global Ka-band mobile VSAT service that Inmarsat claims is faster and has a lower price per megabit than existing Ku-band services. This service may continue to adversely impact sales of our mini-VSAT Broadband service and related equipment. Our arrangement to use the IntelsatOne Flex service for our HTS network is not exclusive, and competitors\u2019 use of this service could also adversely impact sales. Moreover, consumers may choose other services such as FleetBroadband or Iridium OpenPort for their service coverage at potentially lower hardware costs despite higher service costs and slower data rates.\nAny failure to maintain and expand our third-party distribution relationships may limit our ability to penetrate markets for mobile connectivity products and services.\nWe market and sell our mobile connectivity products and services through an international network of independent retailers, chain stores and distributors, as well as to manufacturers of marine vessels, recreational vehicles and buses. Most of these relationships are non-exclusive, allowing these third parties to market competing products. If we fail to maintain relationships with our current distributors, fail to develop relationships with new distributors in new and existing markets, or manage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing distributors, or if our distributors are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products and services may decline and our operating results could be harmed.\nWe depend on sole or limited source suppliers, and any disruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products on time or at expected cost.\nWe obtain many key components for our products from third-party suppliers, and in some cases we use a single or a limited number of suppliers. Any interruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products until we identify and qualify a new source of supply, which could take several weeks, months or longer and could increase our costs significantly. Suppliers might change or discontinue key components, which could require us to modify our product designs. For example, we previously experienced changes in the chemicals used to coat our optical fiber, which changed its characteristics and necessitated design modifications. Regulations requiring government contractors to implement processes to avoid counterfeit parts may require us to find new sources of materials or components if a supplier cannot meet those requirements. In general, we do not have written long-term supply agreements with our suppliers but instead buy components through purchase orders, which expose us to potential price increases and termination of supply without notice or recourse. We generally do not carry significant inventories of product components, which could magnify the impact of the loss of a supplier. If we must use a new source of supply, we could face unexpected manufacturing difficulties and loss of product performance or reliability. In addition, from time to time, lead times for certain components can increase significantly due to imbalances in overall market supply and demand. This, in turn, could limit our ability to satisfy demand for our products on a timely basis and could result in the cancellation of customer orders. Further, adverse economic conditions, including conditions caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic, could result in financial difficulties or bankruptcy for any of our suppliers, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may source more materials and components from international suppliers, which could disrupt our business.\nAlthough we have historically manufactured and sourced raw materials for the majority of our products domestically, in order for us to compete with lower priced competing products while also improving our profitability, in some instances we have found it desirable to source raw materials and manufactured components and assemblies from Europe, Asia, and South and North America. Reliance on foreign manufacturing and/or raw material supply has lengthened our supply chain and increased the risk that a disruption in that supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nChanges in the competitive environment, supply chain issues, and the transition to our HTS network may require inventory write-downs.\nFrom time to time, we have recorded significant inventory charges and/or inventory write-offs as a result of substantial declines in customer demand. For example, in 2019, we recorded a $2.3 million inventory reserve relating to our TracPhone V-IP products as we decided to no longer promote sales of these products but instead to focus our efforts on migrating customers to our HTS network and products. Market or competitive changes could lead to future charges for excess or obsolete inventory, especially if we are unable to appropriately adjust the supply of material from our vendors.\nRisks related to intellectual property\nWe are devoting significant resources to research and development efforts that may be unsuccessful. If we are unable to improve our existing mobile connectivity and inertial navigation products and services and develop new, innovative products and services, our sales and market share may decline.\nThe markets for mobile connectivity products and services and inertial navigation products and services are each characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations, and evolving industry standards. For example, we now compete with Inmarsat's Fleet Xpress satellite communications products and services. If we fail to make innovations in our existing products and services and reduce the costs of our products and services in a timely way, our market share may decline. For example, the introductions of our TracVision TV-series antennas in 2014 occurred later than we had anticipated, which we believe led certain customers to purchase competing products. Products or services using new technologies, or emerging industry standards, could render our products and services obsolete. If our competitors successfully introduce new or enhanced products or services that outperform our products or services, or are perceived as doing so, we may be unable to compete successfully in the markets affected by these changes.\nResearch and development in our industry is inherently complex and uncertain, and our current and anticipated research and development projects may not achieve the results we seek. Our research and development expenses decreased 1% from 2019 to 2020, and the financial resources that we can devote to our research and development efforts may be insufficient to achieve our goals. Our efforts may not result in any viable products or may result in products whose performance, features, price or availability may not be attractive to customers or that we cannot manufacture and sell profitably.\nOur business may suffer if we cannot protect our proprietary technology.\nOur ability to compete depends significantly upon our patents, copyrights, source code, and other proprietary technology. The steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us. Our patents will eventually expire and could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Customers or others with access to our proprietary or licensed media content could copy that content without permission or otherwise violate the terms of our customer agreements, which would adversely affect our revenues and could impair our relationships with content providers. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary technology to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which could increase the likelihood of misappropriation. Any misappropriation of our technology or the development of competing technology could seriously harm our competitive position, which could lead to a substantial reduction in net sales. If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome, disruptive and expensive, distract the attention of management, and there can be no assurance that we would prevail.\nAlso, we have delivered certain technical data and information to the U.S. government under procurement contracts, and it may have unlimited rights to use that technical data and information. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will not authorize others to use that data and information to compete with us.\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and financial condition.\nOur industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents, patents that may be issued in the future, or other intellectual property rights of others.\nFrom time to time we have faced claims by third parties that our products or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights, and we may face similar claims in the future. For example, we were sued for patent infringement in 2015, and we settled this claim in January 2016 with a payment of cash. Any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against or settling the claim, even if the claim is invalid, and could distract the attention of our management. If any of our products are found to violate third-party proprietary rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages. In addition, we may be required to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products. Any efforts to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful, which would prevent us from selling our products, and, in any case, could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to indebtedness\nAn anticipated audit of our Paycheck Protection Program loan may result in, among other things, a determination that we are not entitled to forgiveness of the loan or that we were not entitled to receive the loan, in which case we would have to repay the loan, with interest, and may face penalties and harm to our reputation.\nIn early May 2020, we received a $6.9 million loan from Bank of America, N.A. under the Paycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. The loan is described in more detail in Note 5 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. The loan has a term of two years, and upon application to the Small Business Administration, or SBA, all or a portion of the loan may be forgiven, depending on our use of proceeds and other factors. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is available for certain payroll costs, rent payments, mortgage interest and utilities, if stated conditions are met. While we believe we have used the proceeds of the loan for purposes eligible for forgiveness, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for any loan forgiveness, that we will apply for forgiveness, or that any amount of the loan will be forgiven, in which case we must repay the loan with interest.\nThe previous Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury stated that all Paycheck Protection Program loans over $2.0 million would be audited; accordingly, we expect that our loan and any application we file for forgiveness will be reviewed carefully. In order to apply for the loan, we were required to certify, among other things, that the then-current economic uncertainty made the loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. We made this certification in good faith after our management and our Board of Directors reviewed our history of losses, our financial situation, our expectations regarding the impact of the pandemic on our business, and our access to alternative forms of capital, and we believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the loan. The certification we were required to provide did not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. However, the SBA issued guidance stating that it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets would be able to make the required certification in good faith. If, despite our good-faith belief that we satisfied all eligibility requirements for the loan, we are later determined to have been ineligible to receive the loan or to have violated any laws or regulations in connection with the loan, such as the False Claims Act, we may be required\nto repay the loan in full and may be subject to civil, criminal and administrative penalties. Our receipt of the loan may result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, and any review or audit of the loan or any legal claims could consume significant financial and management resources.\nOur credit facility contains financial and restrictive covenants that we may not satisfy, and that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. The credit facility also imposes restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nAlthough no amounts were outstanding under the agreements governing our secured credit facility as of December 31, 2020, the agreements subject us to various financial and other affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include covenants pertaining to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and covenants requiring the mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under the revolver under specified circumstances. The agreements also subject us to various restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, such as raising capital or acquiring businesses. These restrictions may limit or restrict our cash flow and our ability to pursue business opportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests.\nRisks related to government regulation\nOur international operations complicate our business and require us to comply with multiple regulatory environments.\nHistorically, sales to customers outside the United States have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales. We derived 64% and 54% of our revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively, from sales to these foreign customers. We have foreign offices in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan, Norway, Cyprus and the Philippines, as well as a subsidiary in Brazil that manages local sales. Nonetheless, substantially all of our personnel and operations, particularly for our mobile connectivity equipment business and our inertial navigation business, are located in the United States. Our limited international operations may impair our ability to compete successfully in international markets and to meet the service and support needs of our customers in countries where we have little to no infrastructure. We face a number of risks associated with our international business activities, which may increase our costs and require significant management attention. These risks include restrictions on international travel, which may restrict our ability to grow and service our business; tariffs; sanctions or other trade restrictions that preclude or restrict doing business with particular foreign governments, companies or individuals; technical challenges we may face in adapting our mobile connectivity products to function with different satellite services and technology in use in various regions around the world; satisfaction of international regulatory requirements and delays and costs associated with procurement of any necessary licenses or permits; the potential unavailability of content licenses covering international waters and foreign locations; restrictions on the sale of certain inertial navigation products to foreign military and government customers; increased costs of providing customer support in multiple languages; increased costs of managing operations that are international in scope; potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors, which could slow our growth in international markets; potentially longer sales cycles; potentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; and economic and political instability in some international markets.\nWe could incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties if we do not comply with certain regulations.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to a number of legal requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the customs, export, trade sanctions and anti-boycott laws of the United States, including those administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department, as well as those of other nations in which we do business. In addition, many of the countries where our customers use our products and services have licensing and regulatory requirements for the importation and use of satellite communications and reception equipment, including the use of such equipment in territorial waters, the transmission of satellite signals on certain radio frequencies, the transmission of voice over Internet services using such equipment, and, in some cases, the reception of certain video programming services. These laws and regulations are changing continuously, making compliance complex. We incur significant costs identifying and maintaining compliance with applicable licensing and regulatory requirements. In addition, our training and compliance programs and our other internal control policies may be insufficient to protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or third-party contractors. Any violation of these requirements by us or our employees, agents or third-party contractors may subject us to significant criminal and civil liability.\nExports of certain inertial navigation products are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and require a license from the U.S. Department of State prior to shipment.\nWe must comply with the United States Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR. Certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the ITAR and require an individual validated license in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions. Any changes in export regulations or reclassifications of our products may further restrict the export of our products, and we may cease to be able to procure export licenses for our products under existing regulations. The length of time required by the licensing process can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Any restriction on the export of a product line or any amount of our products could cause a significant reduction in net sales.\nWe are subject to FCC rules and regulations, and any non-compliance could subject us to FCC enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services\nThe satellite communications industry is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States and, as a result, we are subject to existing and potential FCC regulations relating to privacy, contributions to the Universal Service Fund, or USF, and other requirements. If we do not comply with FCC rules and regulations, we could be subject to FCC enforcement actions, substantial fines, penalties, loss of licenses and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public process, could hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell our services to customers and could harm our business and results of operations.\nReform of federal and state USF programs could increase the cost of our service to our customers, diminishing or eliminating our pricing advantage.\nThe FCC has been considering reform or other modifications to its USF program, which, if implemented, could change the way we calculate our contribution to USF. In April 2012, the FCC released a proposal to consider reforms to the manner in which companies like us contribute to the federal USF program. In general, the proposal indicates that the FCC is considering changes to the companies that should contribute, how contributions should be assessed, and methods to improve the administration of the system. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or its impact on our business. The changes in the U.S. administration may renew interest in completing this proceeding. Should the FCC adopt new contribution mechanisms or otherwise modify contribution obligations that increase our contribution burden, we will either need to raise the amount we currently collect from our customers to cover this obligation or absorb the costs, which would reduce our profit margins. The attractiveness of our services may also be reduced as compared to the services of our competitors that do not appear to contribute to USF, or do not do so to the same extent that we do.\nPrivacy concerns and domestic or foreign laws and regulations may reduce demand for our services, increase our costs and harm our business.\nOur company and our customers can use our services to collect, use and store personal, confidential and sensitive information regarding the content and manner of usage of our services by them, their employees and maritime crews. Federal, state and foreign governments have adopted and are proposing new and more stringent laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and transfer of information, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect in May 2018. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations could lead to significant remediation expenses, fines, penalties or other liabilities, such as orders or consent decrees that require modifications to our privacy practices, as well as reputational damage or third-party lawsuits seeking damages or other relief. For example, the GDPR imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with penalties of up to the greater of 2%-4% of worldwide revenue or \u20ac10-20 million.\nDomestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may harm our ability, and the ability of our customers, to process, handle, store, use and transmit information, which could reduce demand for some of our services, increase our costs and force us to change our business practices. For example, the invalidation of the Privacy Shield may affect our ability to collect, use and transfer personal information of EU individuals outside of the EU. These laws and regulations are still evolving, are likely to be in flux and may be subject to uncertain interpretation for the foreseeable future. Our business also could be harmed if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country or inconsistent with our current policies and practices or those of our customers.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our income tax expense, net income and cash flow.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ materially from our estimates and may materially affect our income tax benefit or expense, net loss or income, and cash flows in the period in which such determination is made. As of December 31, 2020, we had gross uncertain tax positions of $1.7 million, consisting of a $1.1 million reduction to deferred tax assets and $0.6 million as a liability for uncertain tax positions.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. We have historically recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. We review our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance requirements quarterly. If we are unable to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value of deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which could result in a material income tax charge. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results of recent years.\nRisks related to owning our common stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nOur stock price has historically been volatile. During the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020, the trading price of our common stock ranged from $6.36 to $14.15. Many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, including variations in our quarterly results of operations; the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors; changing needs of military customers; changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts; the hiring or departure of key personnel; acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors; market conditions in our industries; and the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.\nBroad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. When the market price of a company\u2019s stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities litigation against that company. Any such litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses defending against the claim, divert the time and attention of our management and result in significant damages.", "PERMNO": 83390, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "KVHI"}
