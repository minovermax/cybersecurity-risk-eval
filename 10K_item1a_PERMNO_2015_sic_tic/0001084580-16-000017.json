{"cik": "1084580", "company": "Jefferies Group LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-01-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nThe following factors describe some of the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could adversely affect our business or that could otherwise result in changes that differ materially from our expectations. In addition to the specific factors mentioned in this report, we may also be affected by other factors that affect businesses generally such as global or regional changes in economic or business conditions, acts of war, terrorism and natural disasters.\nRecent legislation and new and pending regulation may significantly affect our business.\nIn recent years, there has been significant legislation and increased regulation affecting the financial services industry. These legislative and regulatory initiatives affect not only us, but also our competitors and certain of our clients. These changes could have an effect on our revenue and profitability, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that legislation and regulation will not eventually have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations adopted and to be adopted by the SEC and CFTC introduce a comprehensive regulatory regime for swaps and security-based swaps and parties that deal in such swaps and security-based swaps. Three of our subsidiaries as registered as swap dealers with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. We may also register one or more subsidiaries as security-based swap dealers with the SEC. The new laws and regulations subject certain swaps and security-based swaps to clearing and exchange trading requirements and subject swap dealers and security-based swap dealers to significant new burdens, including (i) capital and margin requirements, (ii) reporting, recordkeeping and internal business conduct requirements, (iii) external business conduct requirements in dealings with swap counterparties (which are particularly onerous when the counterparty is a special entity such as a federal, state, or municipal entity, an ERISA plan, a government employee benefit plan or an endowment), and (iv) large trader position reporting and certain position limit requirements. The final rules under Title VII, including those rules that have already been adopted, for both cleared and uncleared swap transactions will impose increased capital and margin requirements on our registered entities and require additional operational and compliance costs and resources that will likely affect our business.\nSection 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (Volcker Rule) limits certain proprietary trading by banking entities such as banks, bank holding companies and similar institutions. Although we are not a banking entity and are not otherwise subject to these rules, some of our clients and many of our counterparties are banks or entities affiliated with banks and are subject to these restrictions. These sections of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations that are adopted to implement them could negatively affect the swaps and securities markets by reducing their depth and liquidity and thereby affect pricing in these markets. Other negative effects could result from an expansive extraterritorial application of the Dodd-Frank Act in general or the Volcker Rule in particular and/or insufficient international coordination with respect to adoption of rules for derivatives and other financial reforms in other jurisdictions.\nExtensive international regulation of our business limits our activities, and, if we violate these regulations, we may be subject to significant penalties.\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations in every country in which we operate. Firms that engage in securities and derivatives trading, wealth and asset management and investment banking must comply with the laws, rules and regulations imposed by national and state governments and regulatory and self-regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over such activities. Such laws, rules and regulations cover all aspects of the financial services business, including, but not limited to,\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nsales and trading methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of customers\u2019 funds and securities, capital structure, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery and corruption efforts, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.\nEach of our regulators supervises our business activities to monitor compliance with such laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdiction. In addition, if there are instances in which our regulators question our compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, they may investigate the facts and circumstances to determine whether we have complied. At any moment in time, we may be subject to one or more such investigation or similar reviews. At this time, all such investigations and similar reviews are insignificant in scope and immaterial to us. However, there can be no assurance that, in the future, the operations of our businesses will not violate such laws, rules, or regulations and such investigations and similar reviews will not result in adverse regulatory requirements, regulatory enforcement actions and/or fines.\nThe European Market Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d) was enacted in August 2012 and, in common with the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S., is intended, among other things, to reduce counterparty risk by requiring standardized over-the-counter derivatives be cleared through a central counterparty and reported to registered trade repositories. EMIR is being introduced in phases in the U.K., with implementation of additional requirements expected through 2019. The EU finalized the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Market in Financial Instruments Directive, both of which are expected to become effective in January 2018. These give effect to the G-20 commitments, including new market structure-related, reporting, investor protection-related and organizational requirements, requirements on pre- and post-trade transparency, requirements to use certain venues when trading financial instruments (which includes certain derivative instruments), requirements affecting the way investment managers can obtain research, powers of regulators to impose position limits and provisions on regulatory sanctions. The European Commission\u2019s changes to the Capital Requirements Directive (\u201cCRD\u201d) comprising CRD IV and the Capital Requirements Regulation (\u201cCRR\u201d) became effective January 1, 2014 implementing Basel III in the UK and imposing higher requirements around capital quality and liquidity monitoring. The EU is also currently considering or executing upon significant revisions to law covering: resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructure; administration of financial benchmarks; credit rating activities; anti-money-laundering controls; data security and privacy; remuneration principles and proportionality; disclosures under the Basel regime aiming to increase market transparency and consistency; and corporate governance in financial firms.\nAdditional legislation, changes in rules, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, or the entering into businesses that subject us to new rules and regulations may directly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to monitor the impact of new European regulation on our businesses.\nChanging conditions in financial markets and the economy could result in decreased revenues, losses or other adverse consequences.\nAs a global securities and investment banking firm, global or regional changes in the financial markets or economic conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nA market downturn could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions executed for customers and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads.\n\u2022\nUnfavorable financial or economic conditions could reduce the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting, financial advisory and other services. Our investment banking revenues, in the form of financial advisory and sales and trading or placement fees, are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and could therefore be adversely affected by unfavorable financial or economic conditions.\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in the market could lead to losses from principal transactions on our inventory positions.\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in the market could also lead to a reduction in revenues from asset management fees and investment income from managed funds and losses on our own capital invested in managed funds. Even in the absence of a market downturn, below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could reduce asset management revenues and assets under management and result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors.\n\u2022\nLimitations on the availability of credit, such as occurred during 2008, can affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Global market and economic conditions have been particularly disrupted and volatile in the last several years and may be in the future. Our cost and availability of funding could be affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads.\n\u2022\nNew or increased taxes on compensation payments such as bonuses or on balance sheet items may adversely affect our profits.\n\u2022\nShould one of our customers or competitors fail, our business prospects and revenue could be negatively impacted due to negative market sentiment causing customers to cease doing business with us and our lenders to cease loaning us money, which could adversely affect our business, funding and liquidity.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nUnfounded allegations about us could result in extreme price volatility and price declines in our securities and loss of revenue, clients, and employees.\nOur reputation and business activity can be affected by statements and actions of third parties, even false or misleading statements by them. While we have been able to dispel such rumors in the past, our debt-securities prices suffered not only extreme volatility but also record high yields. In addition, our operations in the past have been impacted as some clients either ceased doing business or temporarily slowed down the level of business they do, thereby decreasing our revenue stream. Although we were able to reverse the negative impact of such unfounded allegations and false rumors, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully in the future and our potential failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nA credit-rating agency downgrade could significantly impact our business.\nMaintaining an investment grade credit rating is important to our business and financial condition. We intend to access the capital markets and issue debt securities from time to time; and a decrease in our credit rating would not only increase our borrowing costs, but could also decrease demand for our debt securities and make a successful financing more difficult. In addition, in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contract arrangements and certain other trading arrangements, we may be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Such a downgrade could also negatively impact our debt-securities prices. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded.\nOur principal trading and investments expose us to risk of loss.\nA considerable portion of our revenues is derived from trading in which we act as principal. We may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of fixed income, high yield, international, convertible, and equity securities and futures and commodities for our own account. In any period, we may experience losses on our inventory positions as a result of the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices (including oil prices), lack of trading volume and illiquidity. From time to time, we may engage in a large block trade in a single security or maintain large position concentrations in a single security, securities of a single issuer, securities of issuers engaged in a specific industry, or securities from issuers located in a particular country or region. In general, because our inventory is marked to market on a daily basis, any adverse price movement in these securities could result in a reduction of our revenues and profits. In addition, we may engage in hedging transactions that if not successful, could result in losses.\nWe may incur losses if our risk management is not effective.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure. Our risk management processes and procedures are designed to limit our exposure to acceptable levels as we conduct our business. We apply a comprehensive framework of limits on a variety of key metrics to constrain the risk profile of our business activities. The size of the limit reflects our risk tolerance for a certain activity. Our framework includes inventory position and exposure limits on a gross and net basis, scenario analysis and stress tests, value-at-risk, sensitivities, exposure concentrations, aged inventory, amount of Level 3 assets, counterparty exposure, leverage, cash capital, and performance analysis. While we employ various risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application, including risk tolerance determinations, cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. As a result, we may incur losses notwithstanding our risk management processes and procedures.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent for liquidity from payments from our subsidiaries, many of which are subject to restrictions.\nAs a holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to regulation that restrict dividend payments or reduce the availability of the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to us. In addition, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital requirements.\nIncreased competition may adversely affect our revenues, profitability and staffing.\nAll aspects of our business are intensely competitive. We compete directly with a number of bank holding companies and commercial banks, other brokers and dealers, investment banking firms and other financial institutions. In addition to competition from firms currently in the securities business, there has been increasing competition from others offering financial services, including automated trading and other services based on technological innovations. We believe that the principal factors affecting competition\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\ninvolve market focus, reputation, the abilities of professional personnel, the ability to execute the transaction, relative price of the service and products being offered, bundling of products and services and the quality of service. Increased competition or an adverse change in our competitive position could lead to a reduction of business and therefore a reduction of revenues and profits.\nCompetition also extends to the hiring and retention of highly skilled employees. A competitor may be successful in hiring away employees, which may result in our losing business formerly serviced by such employees. Competition can also raise our costs of hiring and retaining the employees we need to effectively operate our business.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth.\nOur businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.\nCertain of our financial and other data processing systems rely on access to and the functionality of operating systems maintained by third parties. If the accounting, trading or other data processing systems on which we are dependent are unable to meet increasingly demanding standards for processing and security or, if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be adversely affected. Such consequences may include our inability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk.\nIn addition, despite the contingency plans we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and devote significant resources to maintaining and upgrading our systems and networks with measures such as intrusion and detection prevention systems, monitoring firewall to safeguard critical business applications and supervising third party providers that have access to our systems, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. Additionally, if a client\u2019s computer system, network or other technology is compromised by unauthorized access, we may face losses or other adverse consequences by unknowingly entering into unauthorized transactions. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks. Furthermore, such events may cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations, including the transmission and execution of unauthorized transactions. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. The increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices as well as cloud computing may also heighten these and other operational risks. Similar to other firms, we and our third party providers continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access, computer viruses and malware, and cyber attacks designed to disrupt of degrade service or cause other damage and denial of service. Additional challenges are posed by external parties, including foreign state actors. There can be no assurance that such unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur in the future, and they could occur more frequently and on a larger scale.\nWe face numerous risks and uncertainties as we expand our business.\nWe expect the growth of our business to come primarily from internal expansion and through acquisitions and strategic partnering. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that our financial controls, the level and knowledge of our personnel, our operational abilities, our legal and compliance controls and our other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage our business and our growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, as we acquire new businesses and introduce new products, we face numerous risks and uncertainties integrating their controls and systems into ours, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls and other operations. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient integration of these systems and controls, could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCertain business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses, may bring us into contact directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes and new markets. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign and operational risks, and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held.\nOur international operations subject us to numerous risks which could adversely impact our business in many ways.\nOur business and operations are expanding internationally. Wherever we operate, we are subject to legal, regulatory, political, economic and other inherent risks. The laws and regulations applicable to the securities and investment banking industries differ in each country. Our inability to remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in a particular country could have a significant and negative effect on our business and prospects in that country as well as in other countries. A political, economic or financial disruption in a country or region could adversely impact our business and increase volatility in financial markets generally.\nLegal liability may harm our business.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability, and in the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. The risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The expansion of our business, including increases in the number and size of investment banking transactions and our expansion into new areas impose greater risks of liability. In addition, unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability to us. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects.\nOur business is subject to significant credit risk.\nIn the normal course of our businesses, we are involved in the execution, settlement and financing of various customer and principal securities and derivative transactions. These activities are transacted on a cash, margin or delivery-versus-payment basis and are subject to the risk of counterparty or customer nonperformance. Although transactions are generally collateralized by the underlying security or other securities, we still face the risks associated with changes in the market value of the collateral through settlement date or during the time when margin is extended and the risk of counterparty nonperformance to the extent collateral has not been secured or the counterparty defaults before collateral or margin can be adjusted. We may also incur credit risk in our derivative transactions to the extent such transactions result in uncollateralized credit exposure to our counterparties.\nWe seek to control the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily. We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or return collateral pledged. In the case of aged securities failed to receive, we may, under industry regulations, purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty. However, there can be no assurances that our risk controls will be successful.\nDerivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses.\nWe are party to a number of derivative transactions that require us to deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation and may have difficulty obtaining, or be unable to obtain, the underlying security, loan or other obligation through the physical settlement of other transactions. As a result, we are subject to the risk that we may not be able to obtain the security, loan or other obligation within the required contractual time frame for delivery. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk as well as increased costs to the firm.", "PERMNO": 86804, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "LUK2"}
