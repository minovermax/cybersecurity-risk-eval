{"cik": "1383875", "company": "LRI HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nVarious risks and uncertainties could affect our business. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Report or our other filings with the SEC could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. Therefore, the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we fail to execute the strategies to reposition our brand and increase the consistency of our execution we may not be able to reverse the declines in our comparable restaurant sales.\nIn fiscal year 2015, our comparable restaurant sales decreased 2.4% and customer traffic decreased 6.9% comparable to fiscal year 2014. While we are implementing a number of measures to revitalize the Logan\u2019s Roadhouse brand, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. We intend to improve the customer experience around consistency of execution of exceptional food and service. In addition, we also expect to broaden our marketing mix to other channels to reach our target audience and thus attract new customers and increase the frequency of visits from our current customers. We are evaluating all customer touch points from menu offerings to marketing mix to restaurant atmosphere in an effort to strengthen our overall brand position. These measures or any other changes we implement may not increase customer traffic or improve the performance of our restaurants. Accordingly, it is possible that the trend of declining comparable restaurant sales will continue. In addition, this transformation may also result in unexpected expenses and losses that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our brand.\nIf we are unable to improve the performance of our restaurants, the financial position and operating results of the Company may be adversely impacted and we will not realize the anticipated benefits of our brand revitalization efforts. Even if our transformation efforts are successful, it may take a significant period of time for these efforts to result in increased revenues or comparable store sales growth.\n- 11 -\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms.\nThe development of our business may require significant additional capital in the future to fund our operations and growth, among other activities. We have historically relied upon cash generated by our operations and lease financing to fund our expansion. In the future, we intend to rely on funds from operations, lease financing and our Revolver. We may also need to access the debt and equity capital markets for additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that these sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our then-outstanding debt. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financings unattractive to us. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital, our growth would be impeded.\nOur Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility will expire in April 2017. We may be unable to extend or replace this credit facility on acceptable terms.\nOur Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility will expire in April 2017. We may be unable to extend or replace this credit facility on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and there can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. A lack or high cost of credit could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or other purposes in the future, as needed. If future cash flows from operations and other sources of funds are insufficient to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets, or obtain additional equity capital. A return to recent tight credit markets may make replacement financing more expensive and difficult to obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our credit facility on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. The inability to obtain additional or replacement financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nChanges in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Commodity pricing is volatile and can change unpredictably and over short periods. The impact of changes in commodity prices is also affected by the term and duration of our supply contracts, which are typically one-year contracts. These contracts are negotiated at each renewal and we cannot guarantee that they will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all. Any increase in food prices, particularly for beef, chicken, produce and seafood could adversely affect our operating results. If beef prices remain at these high levels or increase further, our restaurant operating margins will continue to be negatively impacted. In addition, we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as weather conditions, food safety concerns, costs of distribution, production problems, delivery difficulties, product recalls and government regulations. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices, menu items and prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, because our menu items are moderately priced, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers. If we adjust pricing there is no assurance that we will realize the full benefit of any adjustment due to changes in our customers\u2019 menu item selections and customer traffic.\nWe may incur costs or liabilities resulting from breaches of security of confidential customer information related to our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions.\nThe majority of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Other retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information has been stolen. Though we have mechanisms in place to protect information transmitted by credit or debit card, there is no guarantee that such mechanisms will be effective to prevent such information from being compromised by unscrupulous third parties. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect for long periods of time, which may cause a breach to go undetected for an extensive period of time. Advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools, and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach. Further, the systems currently used for transmission and approval of electronic payment transactions, and the technology utilized in electronic payment themselves, all of which can put electronic payment at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, not by us. In addition, our franchisees, contractors, or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to misappropriate such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. If a person is able to circumvent our security measures or those of third parties, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. Any such claim or proceeding could cause us to incur significant unplanned\n- 12 -\nexpenses, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may have a material adverse effect on us and our restaurants.\nMacroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our ability to increase the sales and profits of existing restaurants or to open new restaurants.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations. Recessionary economic cycles, a protracted economic slowdown, a worsening economy, increased unemployment, increased energy prices, rising interest rates or other industry-wide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining and lead to a decline in sales and earnings. Job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause customers to make fewer discretionary purchases, and any significant decrease in our customer traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance. In addition, if gasoline, natural gas, electricity and other energy costs increase, and credit card, home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates, our customers may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out, may spend less on each dining out occasion, or may choose more inexpensive restaurants.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, heightened security requirements, or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure, such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems, could have on our operations, the economy or consumer confidence generally. Any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us.\nIn addition, a majority of our company-owned restaurants are located in the Southeast to Southwest United States, and as a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those regions, including their labor markets. Given our geographic concentration in these regions, negative publicity regarding any of our restaurants in these regions could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other occurrences in these regions such as local strikes, energy shortages or increases in energy prices, droughts, hurricanes, fires, floods or other natural disasters.\nUnfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs, reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing, any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with many well-established restaurant companies on the basis of type and quality of menu offerings, pricing, customer service, atmosphere, location and overall customer experience. We also compete with other restaurant chains and retail businesses for quality site locations and management and hourly employees. Our competitors include a large and diverse group from independent local operators to well-capitalized national restaurant companies. In addition, we face growing competition from the supermarket industry, with the improvement of their \u201cconvenience meals\u201d in the form of improved entrees and side dishes from the deli section. Many of our competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial resources, a greater number of restaurants, have been in business longer, have greater brand recognition and are better established in the markets where our restaurants are located or are planned to be located. As a result, they may be able to invest greater resources than we can in attracting customers and succeed in attracting customers who would have otherwise come to our restaurants. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nHealth concerns and government regulation relating to the consumption of beef, chicken, peanuts or other food products could affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nBeef and chicken are key ingredients in many of our menu items. Health concerns about the consumption of beef or chicken or negative publicity concerning food quality, illness and injury in general, could affect our customer preferences. In recent years, there has been negative publicity concerning e. coli, hepatitis A, \u201cmad cow\u201d disease, \u201cfoot-and-mouth\u201d disease, avian influenza, peanut and other food allergies and other public health concerns affecting the food supply. This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning food products we serve, may adversely impact demand for our food and could result in a decrease in customer traffic to our restaurants. If we react to the negative publicity by changing our menu, we may lose customers who do not prefer the new menu, and we may not be able to attract sufficient new customers to generate the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. These health concerns, negative publicity, or menu changes could result in a decrease in customer traffic or a change in product mix, which could materially harm our business.\n- 13 -\nPeanuts contribute to the atmosphere of our restaurants, and we offer buckets of peanuts on our tables and throughout our restaurants. Owing to the severe nature of some peanuts allergies, peanuts have recently been identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a significant allergen, and federal and state regulators have contemplated extending current peanut labeling regulations to the restaurant industry. The introduction of such regulations could cause us to reduce our use of peanuts and modify the atmosphere of our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business and brand differentiation.\nHealth concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or food-borne illness may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as avian influenza, SARS and H1N1, or food-borne illness. Food safety is top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. However, a widespread health epidemic or food-borne illness, whether or not traced to one of our restaurants, may cause customers to avoid public gathering places or otherwise change their eating behaviors. Even the prospect of a health epidemic could change consumer perceptions of food safety, disrupt our supply chain and impact our ability to supply certain menu items or staff our restaurants. To the extent that a virus is food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our customers to eat less of a product or avoid eating in restaurants. If a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or customers could become infected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places. In addition, certain jurisdictions in which we have restaurants may impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations. Any of these events or any related negative publicity would adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and past results are not indicative of future results.\nOur net sales fluctuate seasonally and are historically lowest in the fall. Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods adversely impacts our profitability. Additionally, holidays, severe weather and timing of marketing initiatives may affect sales volumes seasonally in some of our markets. Our quarterly results have been and will continue to be affected by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated pre-opening costs, as well as, restaurant closures and exit-related costs and impairments of tangible and intangible assets. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nWe rely heavily on certain vendors, suppliers and distributors which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to maintain consistent prices and quality throughout our restaurants depends in part upon our ability to acquire specified food products and supplies in sufficient quantities. In many cases, we may have only one supplier for a product or supply, including our beef and chicken supply. Our dependence on single source suppliers subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations. In addition, we rely on a contract with one primary distributor to deliver products to our restaurants. If any of these vendors, our other suppliers or our primary distributor is unable to fulfill their obligations, or if we are unable to find replacement providers in the event of a supply or service disruption, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, which would materially harm our business.\nWe may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future.\nIn accordance with accounting guidance as it relates to the impairment of long-lived assets, we make certain estimates and projections with regard to company-owned restaurant operations. When impairment triggers are deemed to exist for any given company-owned restaurant, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the restaurant are compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value.\nWe also review the value of our goodwill, tradename and other intangible assets on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value of such assets. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists. Factors may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. If impairment exists, we compute the amount by comparing the implied fair value to the carrying value and record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference.\nAs discussed further in notes 5 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report, we concluded during impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014 that our goodwill was impaired and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $69.4 million and $29.2 million, respectively. In addition, we determined that our\n- 14 -\nindefinite-lived tradename was impaired in fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014 and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $34.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively. We also recognized $3.9 million and $7.1 million in asset impairment charges during fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014, respectively, relating to our restaurants. The estimates of fair value used in these analyses require management judgment, assumptions and estimates of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates or assumptions, additional impairment charges may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to develop and recruit effective leaders, the loss of our executive officers or a significant shortage of high-quality restaurant employees could harm our business.\nOur future success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our key executives and other employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business if we are unable to find suitable individuals to replace such personnel on a timely basis. Our future growth also depends greatly on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees to work in and manage our restaurants. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees in order to grow our business and avoid higher labor costs associated with turnover. A failure to maintain leadership excellence and build adequate bench strength, a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of high-quality restaurant employees could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to escalating labor costs due to federal and state legislation, labor shortages, turnover and competitive pressures.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions, overtime and tip credits. As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Labor shortages and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs. In addition, if restaurant management and staff turnover trends increase, we could suffer higher direct costs associated with recruiting, training and retaining replacement personnel. Moreover, we could suffer from significant indirect costs, including restaurant disruptions due to management changeover, potential delays in new restaurant openings or adverse customer reactions to inadequate customer service levels due to staff shortages. Competition for qualified employees exerts upward pressure on wages paid to attract such personnel, resulting in higher labor costs, together with greater recruitment and training expense. This could lead us to increase prices. However, if we adjust pricing there is no assurance that we will realize the full benefit of any adjustment due to changes in our customers\u2019 menu item selections and customer traffic. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline.\nOur current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance in the future and the current premiums that we pay for our insurance may increase over time and such increases may be significant. Uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, employee health and property insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal complaints or litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, customers, suppliers, note holders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. These actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination; customer discrimination; food safety issues including poor food quality, food-borne illness, food tampering, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or high-calorie foods (including obesity); other personal injury; trademark infringement; violation of the federal securities laws; or other concerns. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our brand, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable. Litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well. Allegations\n- 15 -\nof illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, for example, could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to state and local \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which may subject us to uninsured liabilities. These statutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Because a plaintiff may seek punitive damages, which may not be fully covered by insurance, this type of action could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain and maintain required licenses and permits or to comply with alcoholic beverage or food control regulations could lead to the loss of our liquor and food service licenses and, thereby, harm our business.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to various federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages. Such regulations are subject to change from time to time. The failure to obtain and maintain the required licenses, permits and approvals could adversely affect our operating results. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which may include alcoholic beverage control, health and safety and fire agencies in the state, county or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Each restaurant is required to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises from a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. In some states, the loss of a license for cause with respect to one location may lead to the loss of licenses at all locations in that state and could make it more difficult to obtain additional licenses in that state. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of each restaurant, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. Difficulties or failure to maintain or obtain the required licenses and approvals could adversely affect our existing restaurants and delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on information technology, and any material failure, weakness, interruption or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, payment of obligations, collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions and other processes and procedures, some of which are licensed from third parties. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations, and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem.\nIf we fail to execute our strategy and to open new restaurants that are profitable, our business could suffer.\nA key aspect of our strategy is disciplined restaurant growth. In fiscal year 2015, we opened one restaurant and in fiscal year 2016, we currently plan to open one new prototype restaurant. We expect to open substantially all of our new restaurants in, or adjacent to, states where we have existing restaurants. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants, or achieving lower than expected sales in new restaurants, could materially adversely affect us. Our ability to open new restaurants successfully will also depend on numerous other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other items, the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to secure attractive new restaurant sites;\n\u2022\nconsumer acceptance of our new restaurants;\n\u2022\nour ability to control construction and development costs of new restaurants;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire, train and retain skilled management and restaurant employees;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain, for acceptable cost, required permits and approvals including liquor licenses; and\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and pre-opening expenses.\nSome of our new restaurants will be located in areas where we have existing restaurants. Increasing the number of locations in these markets may cause us to over-saturate markets and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing restaurants, thereby adversely affecting our overall profitability.\nSome of our new restaurants will be located in areas where we have little or no experience. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our new restaurants in these markets to be less successful than restaurants in existing markets. An additional risk of expanding into new markets is the lack of market awareness of the Logan\u2019s Roadhouse brand.\n- 16 -\nWe may not be able to respond timely to all of the changing demands that our planned expansion will impose on management and on our existing infrastructure nor be able to hire or retain the necessary additional management and operating personnel. Our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may not be adequate to support our planned expansion. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls.\nRestaurants we open may not be profitable or achieve operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants. The actual performance of our new restaurants may also differ from their originally targeted performance, which difference may be material. Such performance can vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including site selection, average unit volumes, restaurant-level profitability and associated investment costs and these variances may be material.\nOur failure or inability to enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position or the value of our brand.\nWe own certain common law trademark rights and a number of federal trademark and service mark registrations, including our trade name and logo and proprietary rights relating to our methods of operation and certain of our core menu offerings. We currently own the exclusive rights to use various domain names containing or relating to our brand. We rely on the trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the United States, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position, and, therefore, we devote appropriate resources to their protection. However, we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use, imitation or infringement by others, which could harm our image, brand or competitive position. If we commence litigation to enforce our rights, such proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail.\nWe cannot assure you that our intellectual property does not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others, or that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming and distracting for executive management, result in costly litigation and, should we be found liable, cause changes to existing menu items or delays in introducing new menu items, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur franchisees could take actions that could be harmful to our business.\nOur franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with our standards and all applicable laws. Although we attempt to properly train and support franchisees, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchised restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, our image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could adversely affect our business and operating results. Further, the failure of either of our two franchisees or any of their restaurants to remain financially viable could result in their failure to pay royalties owed to us. Finally, regardless of the actual validity of such a claim, we may be named as a party in an action relating to, and/or be held liable for, the conduct of our franchisees if it is shown that we exercise a sufficient level of control over a particular franchisee\u2019s operation.\nWe are subject to many federal, state and local laws with which compliance is both costly and complex.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to minimum wage and other labor issues, health care, building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and liquor licenses, federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees (including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and applicable requirements concerning the minimum wage, overtime, family leave, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards, immigration status, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates and state and local payroll taxes), federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA.\nWe are subject to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (\"PPACA\"). There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance. PPACA also requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. We do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with this provision, but cannot anticipate any changes in customer behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations.\n- 17 -\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. There also has been increasing focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, where \u201ccap and trade\u201d initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities, which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment.\nWe are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are subject to various state laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises, as well as the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission. Additionally, many state laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship, including the nature, timing and sufficiency of disclosures to franchisees upon the initiation of the franchisor-potential franchisee relationship, our conduct during the franchisor-franchisee relationship and renewals and terminations of franchises. Any past or future failures by us to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in franchisee-initiated lawsuits, a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, civil and administrative penalties or other fines, or require us to make offers of rescission, disgorgement or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We could also face lawsuits by our franchisees based upon alleged violations of these laws. In the case of willful violations, criminal sanctions could be brought against us.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nAny strategic transactions that we consider in the future may have unanticipated consequences that could harm our business and our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate potential transactions, acquisitions of restaurants (including from our franchisees), joint ventures or other strategic initiatives to acquire or develop additional concepts. To successfully execute any acquisition or development strategy, we will need to identify suitable acquisition or development candidates, negotiate acceptable acquisition or development terms and obtain appropriate financing. Any acquisition or future development that we pursue, whether or not successfully completed, may involve risks, including:\n\u2022\nmaterial adverse effects on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisition or development as the restaurants are integrated into our operations;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering into new domestic markets or conducting operations where we have no or limited prior experience, including international markets;\n\u2022\nrisks inherent in accurately assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates, and our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nWe are controlled by the Kelso Affiliates, and their interests as equity holders may conflict with your interests.\nThe Kelso Affiliates beneficially own a substantial majority of our equity. The Kelso Affiliates control our board of directors, and thus are able to appoint new management and approve any action requiring the vote of our outstanding common stock, including amendments of our certificate of incorporation, transactions and sales of substantially all of our assets. The directors elected by the Kelso Affiliates are able to make decisions affecting our capital structure, including decisions to issue additional capital stock\n- 18 -\nand incur additional debt. The interests of our equity holders may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of our public debt holders. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of our equity holders might conflict with the interests of our note holders. Our equity holders may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to the note holders.\nFailure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results or otherwise harm our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), which requires, among other things, SEC reporting companies to maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and management to attest to the effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. In addition, due to an exemption established by rules of the SEC, we are not required to have and have not had our independent registered public accounting firm perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Had our independent registered public accounting firm performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, control deficiencies may have been identified by our independent registered public accounting firm and those control deficiencies could have also represented one or more material weaknesses. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence.\nA change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results. Additionally, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to, revenue recognition, fair value of investments, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and related economic transactions, intangibles, self-insurance, income taxes, property and equipment, unclaimed property laws and litigation, and stock-based compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and are able to take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies.\nCongress enacted the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the \u201cJOBS Act,\u201d on April 5, 2012. Pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d For as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other reporting companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports. Therefore, any such information may not be available to you. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nIn addition, Sections 102(b) and 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to non-reporting companies. However, we have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. If other emerging growth companies take advantage of the extended transition period, our financials may no longer be comparable to such companies\u2019 financials, and we may be disadvantaged by any new or revised accounting standard that is unfavorable to us. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\n- 19 -\nChanges to the current law with respect to the assignment of liabilities in the franchise relationship could adversely impact us.\nAs of August 2, 2015, we have two franchisees that operate a total of 26 restaurants. One of the legal foundations fundamental to the franchise relationship has been that, absent special circumstances, a franchiser is generally not responsible for the acts, omissions or liabilities of its franchisees. Recently, established law has been challenged and questioned by the plaintiffs\u2019 bar and certain regulators, and the outcome of these challenges and new regulatory positions remains unknown. If these challenges and/or new positions are successful in altering currently settled law, it could significantly change the relationship between us and our franchisees. For example, a determination that we are a \u201cjoint employer\u201d with our franchisees or that our franchisees are part of our system with joint and several liability under the National Labor Relations Act, statutes administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, regulations and other areas of labor and employment law, could subject us to liability for the unfair labor practices, wage-and-hour law violations, employment discrimination law violations, OSHA regulation violations and other employment-related liabilities of one of our franchisees. In addition, if these changes were to be expanded outside of the employment context, we could be held liable for other claims against our franchisees such as personal injury claims by customers at franchised restaurants. Therefore, any regulatory action or court decisions expanding the vicarious liability of franchisers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness and any new indebtedness we incur in the future could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of August 2, 2015, our total long-term debt was $374.2 million, representing our Notes and outstanding borrowings on our Revolver. We have commitments under our Revolver available to us of $30.0 million (less approximately $4.8 million of undrawn outstanding letters of credit and $19.2 million of outstanding borrowings as of August 2, 2015), all of which are secured on a first-priority basis.\nSubject to the limits contained in the indenture governing the Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. The additional indebtedness we may incur could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and Credit Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, including obligations under lease arrangements that are currently recorded as operating leases even if operating leases were to be treated as debt under GAAP. If we do incur additional debt, the risks related to our high level of debt would intensify. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under the Revolver will be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the Indenture and the Credit Agreement contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\n- 20 -\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Credit Agreement and the Indenture restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our debt.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Revolver could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement and the Indenture restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe Credit Agreement and the Indenture contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nalter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement require us, at any time revolving loans are made or are outstanding or any letter of credit is issued or outstanding, to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of the covenants under the Indenture or the Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement permits the lenders under the Revolver to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the new revolving credit facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nAs a result of restrictions contained in the Indenture and the Credit Agreement, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy.", "PERMNO": 81894, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "6033B"}
