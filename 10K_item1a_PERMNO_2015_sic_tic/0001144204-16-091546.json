RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report and in our other public filings, in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and our future profitability is uncertain.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our inception in 1992. Prior to our merger with Biocontrol in January 2011, our accumulated deficit was $315.5 million. Since January 2011 through December 31, 2015, we have incurred a cumulative deficit of $47.0 million, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have devoted, and will continue to devote for the foreseeable future, substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates. For the year ended December 31, 2015 we had an operating loss of $10.2 million. Additional information regarding our results of operations may be found in our consolidated financial statements and in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included elsewhere in this report.\nClinical trials and activities associated with discovery research are costly. We do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term, and we expect to continue to have significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nTo attain ongoing profitability, we will need to develop products successfully and market and sell them effectively, or rely on other parties to do so. We cannot predict when we will achieve ongoing profitability, if at all. We have never generated revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. If we fail to become profitable, or if we are unable to fund our continuing losses, we would be unable to continue our research and development programs.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nOur ability to generate meaningful revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, and the ability of any third party with which we may partner, to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to, commercialize our product candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future, if ever. If any of our product candidates fail in clinical trials or if any of our product candidates do not gain regulatory approval, or if any of our product candidates, if approved, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:\n\u00b7 completing research and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 seeking and obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates for which we complete clinical trials;\n\u00b7 developing a sustainable, scalable, reproducible, and transferable manufacturing process for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 launching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either by establishing a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure, or by collaborating with a partner;\n\u00b7 obtaining market acceptance of any approved products;\n\u00b7 addressing any competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7 implementing additional internal systems and infrastructure, as needed;\n\u00b7 identifying and validating new product candidates;\n\u00b7 negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n\u00b7 maintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u00b7 attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, the EMA, or other foreign regulatory authorities to perform clinical trials and other studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of any approved products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to continue operations.\nOur consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern. However, we have had recurring losses from operations, negative operating cash flow and an accumulated deficit.\nIn December 2013, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $18.0 million through a private placement of shares of our common stock. In March 2015, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $13.0 million through a private placement of shares of our common stock. We do not generate any cash from operations and must raise additional funds in order to continue operating our business. We expect to continue to fund our operations primarily through equity and debt financings in the future. If additional capital is not available to us when needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan or we may have to discontinue our operations entirely. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.4 million. We believe that our existing resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through the third quarter of 2016.\nDeveloping drugs and conducting clinical trials is expensive. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of our research and development activities;\n\u00b7 the progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u00b7 the cost and timing of securing manufacturing capabilities for our clinical product candidates and commercial products, if any;\n\u00b7 the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, acquisition or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent applications, claims, patents and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u00b7 the costs of lawsuits involving us or our product candidates.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to support our product development activities in 2016 and beyond. We may seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to the products candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently. We cannot be certain that we will be able to enter into any such arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources, including:\n\u00b7 the public equity market;\n\u00b7 private equity financings;\n\u00b7 collaborative arrangements;\n\u00b7 licensing arrangements; and/or\n\u00b7 public or private debt.\nAny additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend, in part, on the status of our product development activities and other business operations, as well as factors related to financial, economic, and market conditions, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on acceptable terms, if at all. Raising additional capital through the sale of securities could cause significant dilution to our stockholders. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through additional arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products, technologies or potential markets, any of which could delay or require that we curtail or eliminate some or all of our development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our research and development, which could delay the time to market for any of our product candidates, if adequate funds are not available.\nIf we are unable to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to cease or reduce certain research and development projects, to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity. Insufficient funds may require us to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our activities, and if we are unable to obtain additional funding, there is uncertainty regarding our continued existence.\nWe have a disagreement with one of our principal stockholders regarding the interpretation of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.\nWe have a disagreement with one of our principal stockholders, Third Security, LLC. Third Security, together with its affiliates, including Randal J. Kirk, is currently the beneficial owner of approximately 27.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock, including securities convertible into common stock (Common Shares). Additionally, Third Security is currently the beneficial owner of approximately 28.5% of our outstanding shares of Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock (Series B Preferred). Julian Kirk, the son of Randal J. Kirk and a member of our Board of Directors, is a Managing Director of Third Security.\nSection 4.4.4(b) of Article 4 of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provides in relevant part as follows:\n\u201cAutomatic Conversion. The shares of Series B Preferred shall be automatically converted into fully paid and non-assessable Common Shares, at the then applicable Series B Preferred Conversion Rate (i) upon the closing of an underwritten initial public offering with aggregate offering proceeds to [AmpliPhi] of at least $7,000,000 (after reduction for underwriting discounts and commissions) and a price per share to the public of at least the Series B Stated Value (subject to adjustment in the event of any . . . stock split . . .) upon the closing of which the shares of Common Stock of [AmpliPhi] shall be listed for trading on the . . . New York Stock Exchange . . . or (ii) at the election of the holders of two-thirds (2/3) of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred.\u201d\nWe refer to an underwritten public offering that meets all of the parameters specified in Section 4.4.4(b)(i) of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation as a \u201cQualified Public Offering.\u201d In June and July 2013, when our shares were not listed on any exchange, we issued shares of Series B Preferred to Third Security and other investors as part of a private placement in which we raised approximately $13.3 million (the Series B Financing). In December 2013, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 10 and registered our shares for trading on the OTC. In March 2015, we issued Common Shares to Third Security and other investors as part of a private placement in which we raised approximately $13.0 million. In August 2015, we completed our listing application and our Common Shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s NYSE MKT Exchange (NYSE MKT). Since the Series B Financing, we have not completed an underwritten public offering of our stock.\nAs part of our ongoing management of our business, we frequently evaluate financing alternatives with the objective of assessing opportunities to raise capital needed for the advancement of our business. We may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources, including the public equity market, private equity financings, collaborative arrangements, licensing arrangements and/or public or private debt. We believe that at such time as we consummate our first underwritten public offering that otherwise meets the specified parameters for a Qualified Public Offering set forth in Section 4.4.4(b)(i) of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Series B Preferred should automatically convert into Common Shares.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, Third Security informed us that, under its interpretation of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Qualified Public Offering conditions set forth in Article 4 of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation can never be satisfied because our stock is publicly traded on the NYSE MKT, and that the only way all outstanding Series B Preferred can be converted to Common Shares is by obtaining the requisite consent of the Series B Preferred stockholders. We disagree with Third Security\u2019s interpretation. In an attempt to resolve the disagreement, we formed a special committee of our Board, consisting of disinterested directors Michael Perry, Paul Grint and Vijay Samant (Special Committee), that has been delegated full authority to negotiate and finalize relevant settlement arrangements with Third Security and other holders of Series B Preferred relating to the interpretation of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation. Over the past several months, the Special Committee has attempted to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Third Security and other holders of the Series B Preferred regarding voluntary conversion of the outstanding Series B Preferred to Common Shares. We cannot assure you that the Special Committee will be able to reach agreement with Third Security or other holders of Series B Preferred on reasonable terms or at all.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation also contain various other ambiguities, such as in the provisions relating to the conversion rate for converting Series B Preferred into Common Shares and the stated value of the Series B Preferred following our 50:1 reverse split of our Common Shares in August 2015. The stated value of the Series B Preferred affects other provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, including the anti-dilution rights for the Series B Preferred as well as the minimum public offering price per share necessary for a public offering to satisfy one of the Qualified Public Offering conditions. These ambiguities, as well as Third Security\u2019s interpretation of the Qualified Public Offering conditions, create uncertainty around our capital structure, which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis on acceptable terms, we may be required to significantly reduce, delay or refocus our research and development programs, sell or relinquish rights to our products, technologies or other assets or merge all or a portion of our business with another entity, any of which could delay the time to market of our product candidates and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This uncertainty around our ability to secure additional financing creates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAttached to this Annual Report as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 are letters dated March 15, 2016 and March 28, 2016 from outside counsel to New River Management VII, LP, the record holder of the shares of Series B Preferred beneficially owned by Third Security. The letters were provided in response to our furnishing drafts of this risk factor to Julian Kirk prior to filing this Annual Report. We express no opinion as to the accuracy of the factual characterizations or legal analyses contained in the letters.\nIn order to reach agreement with Third Security and/or other holders of Series B Preferred regarding the interpretation of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and/or voluntary conversion of the outstanding Series B Preferred to Common Shares, we may be required to pay significant consideration, which may include the issuance of additional Common Shares to those holders and which could result in significant dilution to current holders of our Common Shares. If we are unable to reach agreement on acceptable terms with Third Security and/or other holders of Series B Preferred, we may decide to initiate litigation in the State of Washington seeking a declaratory judgment as to the interpretation of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation. Such litigation would be expensive and time consuming, and would utilize valuable capital needed for the operation of our business. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation regarding our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, that the court would agree with our interpretation of the Qualified Public Offering conditions or any of the ambiguous provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, or that the court would not interpret any of the provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation in a manner unfavorable to us. If the court in such litigation were to agree with Third Security\u2019s interpretation or to otherwise determine the matter unfavorably to us, our ability to raise capital may be severely impaired, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and ability to continue operating as a going concern.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may affect our ability to obtain future financing and may require us to curtail our operations.\nOur financial statements as of December 31, 2015 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. The independent registered public accounting firm that audited our 2015 consolidated financial statements, in their report, included an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.4 million. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to raise substantial additional funds through public or private equity offerings, collaborative or licensing arrangements and/or debt financing.\nWe may be required to make cash payments to the holders of our Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock.\nThe holders of our shares of Series B Preferred are entitled to receive accruing, cumulative dividends at the rate of 10% per annum, payable in cash at the option of the holders of two-thirds of the shares of Series B Preferred (a) when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, (b) upon an acquisition of our company or (c) upon redemption of the Series B Preferred. In addition, if holders of Series B Preferred elect to convert their shares to common stock, or if the Series B Preferred is automatically converted pursuant to the provisions of our articles of incorporation, all accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred will become payable upon conversion. If such holders elect to receive payment for such dividends in cash, or if dividends are required to be paid upon conversion, we will have less cash available, which will have a negative effect on our operations and financial results. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate amount of accrued but unpaid dividends was $3.2 million. In addition, at any time on or after June 26, 2018, the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Series B Preferred may require us to redeem all of the outstanding Series B Preferred for an amount equal to the original issue price per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.\nTaxing authorities could reallocate our taxable income among our subsidiaries, which could increase our overall tax liability.\nWe are organized in the United States, and we currently have subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Australia and Slovenia. If we succeed in growing our business, we expect to conduct increased operations through our subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions pursuant to transfer pricing arrangements between us and our subsidiaries. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries, the tax laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arms\u2019 length and that appropriate documentation is maintained to support the transfer prices. While we believe that we operate in compliance with applicable transfer pricing laws and intend to continue to do so, our transfer pricing procedures are not binding on applicable tax authorities.\nIf tax authorities in any of these countries were to successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arms\u2019 length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, which could result in a higher tax liability to us. In addition, if the country from which the income is reallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both countries could tax the same income, resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating tax loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur ability to utilize or net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). These limitations apply if an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Code, occurs. If we have experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d at any time since our formation, we may already be subject to limitations on our ability to utilize our existing net operating losses and other tax attributes to offset taxable income. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership (including in connection with future private or public offerings, as well as changes that may be outside of our control), may trigger an \u201cownership change\u201d and, consequently, limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. As of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $182.3 million and $37.3 million, respectively, foreign NOLs of $8.5 million and U.S. research and development credits of $5.2 million, which could be limited if we have experienced or do experience any \u201cownership changes.\u201d We have not completed a study to assess whether an \u201cownership change\u201d has occurred or whether there have been multiple \u201cownership changes\u201d since our formation, due to the complexity and cost associated with such a study, and the fact that there may be additional ownership changes in the future.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that it was not effective. If we fail to remediate this material weakness or to achieve and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired and our public reporting may be unreliable.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting adequate to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the second quarter of 2015 and for the quarterly and annual periods of 2014, we determined that we had a material weakness as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, namely that our internal control over financial reporting, including control over the evaluation and review of complex and non-routine transactions, were not effective. A material weakness means a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. As a result, we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future.\nWe are taking steps to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, including designing additional training programs for relevant personnel and developing specific review procedures regarding the review of complex and non-routine transactions. However, we cannot assure you that these efforts will remediate our material weakness in a timely manner, or at all. If we are unable to successfully remediate our material weakness, or identify any future material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports and we may experience a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the market price of our common stock and other securities.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and the NYSE MKT to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and proxy access. Recent legislation permits emerging growth companies to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years following their initial public offering. We intend to take advantage of this new legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than expected and thereby incur unexpected expenses.\nWe expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to result in us continuing to incur substantial legal and financial compliance costs. These costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are seeking to develop antibacterial agents using bacteriophage technology, a novel approach, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development. No bacteriophage products have been approved in the United States or elsewhere.\nWe are developing our product candidates with bacteriophage technology. We have not, nor to our knowledge has any other company, received regulatory approval from the FDA or equivalent foreign agencies for a pharmaceutical drug based on this approach. While in vitro studies have characterized the behavior of bacteriophages in cell cultures and there exists a body of literature regarding the use of phage therapy in humans, the safety and efficacy of phage therapy in humans has not been extensively studied in well-controlled modern clinical trials. Most of the prior research on phage-based therapy was conducted in the former Soviet Union prior to and immediately after World War II and lacked appropriate control group design or lacked control groups at all. Furthermore, the standard of care has changed substantially during the ensuing decades since those studies were performed, diminishing the relevance of prior claims of improved cure rates. We cannot be certain that our approach will lead to the development of approvable or marketable drugs.\nDeveloping phage-based therapies on a commercial scale will also require developing new manufacturing processes and techniques. We and our third-party collaborators may experience delays in developing manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates, and may not be able to do so at the scale required to efficiently conduct the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, or to manufacture commercial quantities of our products, if approved.\nIn addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may lack experience in evaluating the safety and efficacy of drugs based on these approaches, which could lengthen the regulatory review process, increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates.\nDelays in our clinical trials could result in us not achieving anticipated developmental milestones when expected, increased costs and delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates.\nDelays in our ability to commence or enroll patients for our clinical trials could result in us not meeting anticipated clinical milestones and could materially impact our product development costs and delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. Planned clinical trials may not be commenced or completed on schedule, or at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u00b7 delays in the development of manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates to enable their consistent production at clinical trial scale;\n\u00b7 failures in our internal manufacturing operations that result in our inability to consistently and timely produce bacteriophages in sufficient quantities to support our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the availability of financial resources to commence and complete our planned clinical trials;\n\u00b7 delays in reaching a consensus with clinical investigators on study design;\n\u00b7 delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on trial design or in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u00b7 delays in obtaining clinical materials;\n\u00b7 slower than expected patient recruitment for participation in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 failure by clinical trial sites, other third parties, or us to adhere to clinical trial agreements;\n\u00b7 delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms with prospective sites or obtaining institutional review board approval; and\n\u00b7 adverse safety events experienced during our clinical trials.\nIf we do not successfully commence or complete our clinical trials on schedule, the price of our common stock may decline.\nCompletion of clinical trials depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients, which is a function of many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the therapeutic endpoints chosen for evaluation;\n\u00b7 the eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u00b7 the perceived benefit of the product candidate under study;\n\u00b7 the size of the patient population required for analysis of the clinical trial\u2019s therapeutic endpoints;\n\u00b7 our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators and sites with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u00b7 competition for patients from clinical trials for other treatments.\nWe may experience difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, which could increase the costs or affect the timing or outcome of these clinical trials. This is particularly true with respect to diseases with relatively small patient populations.\nWe have not completed formulation development of any of our product candidates.\nThe development of our bacteriophage product candidates requires that we isolate, select and combine a number of bacteriophages that target the desired bacteria for that product candidate. The selection of bacteriophages for any of our product candidates is based on a variety of factors, including without limitation the ability of the selected phages, in combination, to successfully kill the targeted bacteria, the degree of cross-reactivity of the individual phages with the same part of the bacterial targets, the ability of the combined phages to satisfy regulatory requirements, our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the phages, intellectual property rights of third parties, and other factors. While we have selected an initial formulation of AB-SA01 for the treatment of S. aureus infections, there can be no assurance that this will be the final formulation of AB-SA01 for commercialization. In addition, we have initiated final phage selection for AB-PA01, our P. aeruginosa product. AB-CD01, which is our C. difficile product, is at an earlier stage. If we are unable to complete formulation development of our product candidates in the time frame that we have anticipated, then our product development timelines, and the regulatory approval of our product candidates, could be delayed.\nOur product candidates must undergo rigorous clinical testing, such clinical testing may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy and any of our product candidates could cause undesirable side effects, which would substantially delay or prevent regulatory approval or commercialization.\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we must undertake extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Clinical trials of new drug candidates sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are expensive and take years to complete.\nWe cannot be certain of successfully completing clinical testing within the time frame we have planned, or at all. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval or commercializing our product candidates, including the following:\n\u00b7 our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or preclinical testing or to abandon programs;\n\u00b7 the results obtained in earlier stage clinical testing may not be indicative of results in future clinical trials;\n\u00b7 clinical trial results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7 we, or regulators, may suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; and\n\u00b7 our product candidates may have unintended or undesirable effects on patients that may delay or preclude regulatory approval of our product candidates or limit their commercial use, if approved.\nResults from preclinical studies and Phase 1 or 2 clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later stage human clinical trials.\nPreclinical studies, including studies of our product candidates in animal disease models, may not accurately predict the result of human clinical trials of those product candidates. In particular, promising animal studies suggesting the efficacy of prototype phage products in the treatment of bacterial infections, such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, may not predict the ability of these products to treat similar infections in humans. Our phage technology may be found not to be efficacious in treating bacterial infections alone or in combination with other agents, when studied in human clinical trials.\nTo satisfy FDA or foreign regulatory approval standards for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we must demonstrate in adequate and controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective. Success in early clinical trials, including Phase 2 trials, does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. Our initial results from early stage clinical trials also may not be confirmed by later analysis or subsequent larger clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier clinical trials and most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved for commercial sale.\nWe must continue to develop manufacturing processes for our product candidates and any delay in or our inability to do so would result in delays in our clinical trials.\nWe are developing novel manufacturing processes for our product candidates at our facility in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The manufacturing processes for our product candidates, and the scale up of such processes for clinical trials, is novel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete this work in a timely manner, if at all. Any delay in the development or scale up of these manufacturing processes could delay the start of clinical trials and harm our business. Our facility in Slovenia must also undergo ongoing inspections by JAZMP, the Slovenian agency that regulates and supervises pharmaceutical products in Slovenia, for compliance with their and the European Medicines Agency\u2019s, or EMA\u2019s, current good manufacturing practice regulations, or cGMP regulations, before the respective product candidates can be approved for use in clinical trials or commercialization. In the event these facilities do not receive a satisfactory cGMP inspection for the manufacture of our product candidates, we may need to fund additional modifications to our manufacturing process, conduct additional validation studies, or find alternative manufacturing facilities, any of which would result in significant cost to us as well as a delay of up to several years in obtaining approval for such product candidate.\nOur manufacturing facility will be subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the European regulatory authorities, including JAZMP, and the FDA for compliance with European and FDA cGMP regulations. Compliance with these regulations and standards is complex and costly, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply. Any failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed (including fines, injunctions and civil penalties), failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nWe may conduct clinical trials for our products or product candidates outside the United States and the FDA may not accept data from such trials.\nWe are currently conducting an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of AB-SA01 at the University of Adelaide in Australia for chronic rhinosinusitis, and may seek to conduct one or more other clinical trials in the future outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of such study data by the FDA is subject to certain conditions. For example, the study must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The study population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. Generally, the patient population for any clinical studies conducted outside of the United States must be representative of the population for whom we intend to label the product in the United States. In addition, such studies would be subject to the applicable local laws and FDA acceptance of the data would be dependent upon its determination that the studies also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept any such data, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time consuming and delay aspects of our business plan.\nWe may need to license additional intellectual property rights.\nThe development and commercialization of phage-based antibacterial agents may require us to obtain rights to intellectual property from third parties. For example, pursuant to our Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, we are currently focusing on developing bacteriophage therapeutics to treat S. aureus infections. To the extent the intellectual property is generated from the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command or Walter Reed Army Institute of Research that is used in a commercial product, we may be obligated to make payments such as royalties, licensing fees and milestone payments. We may also determine that it is necessary or advisable to license other intellectual property from third parties. There can be no assurance that such intellectual property rights would be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe are conducting an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of AB-SA01 at the University of Adelaide. To the extent that intellectual property is generated as a result of the study that is used in a commercial product, we may be obligated to make payments, such as royalties, licensing fees, and milestone payments. There can be no assurance that such intellectual property rights would be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe are subject to significant regulatory approval requirements, which could delay, prevent or limit our ability to market our product candidates.\nOur research and development activities, preclinical studies, clinical trials and the anticipated manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in Europe and elsewhere. There can be no assurance that our manufacturing facilities will satisfy the requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign authorities. We require the approval of the relevant regulatory authorities before we may commence commercial sales of our product candidates in a given market. The regulatory approval process is expensive and time-consuming, and the timing of receipt of regulatory approval is difficult to predict. Our product candidates could require a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than expected, or may never gain approval. We cannot be certain that, even after expending substantial time and financial resources, we will obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. A delay or denial of regulatory approval could delay or prevent our ability to generate product revenues and to achieve profitability.\nChanges in regulatory approval policies during the development period of any of our product candidates, changes in, or the enactment of, additional regulations or statutes, or changes in regulatory review practices for a submitted product application may cause a delay in obtaining approval or result in the rejection of an application for regulatory approval.\nRegulatory approval, if obtained, may be made subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market a product. These limitations could adversely affect our potential product revenues. Regulatory approval may also require costly post-marketing follow-up studies. In addition, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping related to the product will be subject to extensive ongoing regulatory requirements. Furthermore, for any marketed product, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may, among other things, result in fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, product seizures, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nA variety of risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we have operations and subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Australia and Slovenia. We face risks associated with our international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, pricing and reimbursement, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. We are subject to numerous risks associated with international business activities, including:\n\u00b7 compliance with differing or unexpected regulatory requirements for the development, manufacture and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7 foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements;\n\u00b7 U.S. and foreign government tariffs, trade restrictions, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA;\n\u00b7 economic weakness, including inflation, natural disasters, war, events of terrorism or political instability in particular foreign countries;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations related to doing business in another country;\n\u00b7 compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws, regulations and restrictions for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u00b7 workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u00b7 production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u00b7 changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u00b7 challenges in enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have a sales force and do not currently have plans to develop one.\nThe commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon the strength of sales and marketing efforts for them. We do not have a sales force and have no experience in sales, marketing or distribution. To successfully commercialize our product candidates, we will need to develop such a capability ourselves or seek assistance from a third party with a large distribution system and a large direct sales force. We may be unable to put such a plan in place. In addition, if we arrange for others to market and sell our products, our revenues will depend upon the efforts of those parties. Such arrangements may not succeed. Even if one or more of our product candidates is approved for marketing, if we fail to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, independently or with others, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur success depends in part on attracting, retaining and motivating our personnel.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions, clinicians and scientists. As of March 25, 2016, we had 28 employees. Our success will depend on our ability to retain and motivate personnel and hire additional qualified personnel when required. Competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense. We face competition for personnel from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, universities, public and private research institutions and other organizations. We also face competition from other more well-funded and well-established businesses and we may also be viewed as a riskier choice from a job stability perspective due to our relative newer status than longer existing biotech and pharmaceutical companies. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel. If we are unsuccessful in our retention, motivation and recruitment efforts, we may be unable to execute our business strategy.\nWe must manage a geographically dispersed organization.\nWhile we are a small company, we currently have operations in the United States, Australia and Slovenia. In the future, we may also locate facilities in other locations based on proximity to personnel with the expertise needed to research, develop and manufacture phage-based therapeutics, costs of operations or other factors. Managing our organization across multiple locations and multiple time zones may reduce our efficiency, increase our expenses and increase the risk of operational difficulties in the execution of our plans.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties for aspects of product development.\nWe rely on third parties such as the University of Leicester and the U.S. Army for certain aspects of product development. We are working with the University of Leicester for research and development of product candidates to treat C. difficile infections. We are working with the U.S. Army for research and development of product candidates to treat S. aureus infections, and we have an agreement with Intrexon Corporation regarding the development of bacteriophage and new strains of manufacturing hosts for our phage therapeutics. Because we rely on third parties to conduct these activities, we have less control over the success of these programs than we would if we were conducting them on our own. Factors beyond our control that could impact the success of these programs include the amount of resources devoted to the programs by the applicable third party, the staffing of those projects by third-party personnel, and the amount of time such personnel devote to our programs compared to other programs. Failure of our third-party collaborators to successfully complete the projects that we are working on with them could result in delays in product development and the need to expend additional resources, increasing our expenses beyond current expectations.\nWe will rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and their failure to perform their obligations in a timely or competent manner may delay development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe expect to use third parties, such as clinical research organizations or the U.S. Army, to assist in conducting our clinical trials. However, we may face delays outside of our control if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely or competent fashion or if we are forced to change service providers. This risk is heightened for clinical trials conducted outside of the United States, where it may be more difficult to ensure that clinical trials are conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. Any third-party that we hire to conduct clinical trials may also provide services to our competitors, which could compromise the performance of their obligations to us. If we experience significant delays in the progress of our clinical trials and in our plans to submit Biologics License Applications, the commercial prospects for product candidates could be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue would be delayed or prevented.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are dependent on patents and proprietary technology. If we fail to adequately protect this intellectual property or if we otherwise do not have exclusivity for the marketing of our products, our ability to commercialize products could suffer.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection sufficient to prevent others from marketing our product candidates, as well as to defend and enforce these patents against infringement and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Protection of our product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties will depend on having valid and enforceable patents cover our product candidates or their manufacture or use, or having effective trade secret protection. If our patent applications do not result in issued patents, or if our patents are found to be invalid, we will lose the ability to exclude others from making, using or selling the inventions claimed therein. We have a limited number of patents and pending patent applications.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. This is due to inconsistent application of policy and changes in policy relating to examination and enforcement of biotechnology patents to date on a global scale. The laws of some countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of countries having well-established patent systems, and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights. Also, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We are not able to guarantee that all of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents and we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed in our patent applications or in the patent applications we may license from others.\nCentral provisions of The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act went into effect on September 16, 2012 and on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These changes include provisions that affect the way patent applications are being filed, prosecuted and litigated. For example, the America Invents Act enacted proceedings involving post-issuance patent review procedures, such as inter partes review, or IPR, and post-grant review, that allow third parties to challenge the validity of an issued patent in front of the United States PTO Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Each proceeding has different eligibility criteria and different patentability challenges that can be raised. IPRs permit any person (except a party who has been litigating the patent for more than a year) to challenge the validity of the patent on the grounds that it was anticipated or made obvious by prior art. Patents covering pharmaceutical products have been subject to attack in IPRs from generic drug companies and from hedge funds. If it is within nine months of the issuance of the challenged patent, a third party can petition the United States PTO for post-grant review, which can be based on any invalidity grounds and is not limited to prior art patents or printed publications.\nIn post-issuance proceedings, United States PTO rules and regulations generally tend to favor patent challengers over patent owners. For example, unlike in district court litigation, claims challenged in post-issuance proceedings are given their broadest reasonable meaning, which increases the chance a claim might be invalidated by prior art or lack support in the patent specification. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing whether it is proper for the United States PTO to give claims their broadest reasonable meaning in post-issuance proceedings. As another example, unlike in district court litigation, there is no presumption of validity for an issued patent, and thus, a challenger\u2019s burden to prove invalidity is by a preponderance of the evidence, as opposed to the heightened clear and convincing evidence standard. As a result of these rules and others, statistics released by the United States PTO show a high percentage of claims being invalidated in post-issuance proceedings. Moreover, with few exceptions, there is no standing requirement to petition the United States PTO for inter partes review or post-grant review. In other words, companies that have not been charged with infringement or that lack commercial interest in the patented subject matter can still petition the United States PTO for review of an issued patent. Thus, even where we have issued patents, our rights under those patents may be challenged and ultimately not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or processes.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u00b7 we might not be the first to file patent applications for our inventions;\n\u00b7 others may independently develop similar or alternative product candidates to any of our product candidates that fall outside the scope of our patents;\n\u00b7 our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u00b7 our issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products or may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7 others may design around our patent claims to produce competitive products that fall outside the scope of our patents;\n\u00b7 we may not develop additional patentable proprietary technologies related to our product candidates; and\n\u00b7 we are dependent upon the diligence of our appointed agents in national jurisdictions, acting for and on our behalf, which control the prosecution of pending domestic and foreign patent applications and maintain granted domestic and foreign patents.\nAn issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented products and practicing our patented technology. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from marketing the same or related product candidates or could limit the length of the term of patent protection of our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. Patent term extensions may not be available for these patents.\nWe rely on trade secrets and other forms of non-patent intellectual property protection. If we are unable to protect our trade secrets, other companies may be able to compete more effectively against us.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology, including our proprietary processes for manufacturing and purifying bacteriophages. Trade secrets are difficult to protect, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, where much of the information about a product must be made public during the regulatory approval process. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secret information is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to or may not protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or if we are forced to engage in an interference proceeding, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation or interference would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to commercialize our product candidates depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous United States and foreign patents and patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the general field of anti-infective products or in fields that otherwise may relate to our product candidates. If we are shown to infringe, we could be enjoined from use or sale of the claimed invention if we are unable to prove that the patent is invalid. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe, or which may trigger an interference proceeding regarding one of our owned or licensed patents or applications. There could also be existing patents of which we are not aware that our product candidates may inadvertently infringe or which may become involved in an interference proceeding.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. For so long as our product candidates are in clinical trials, we believe our clinical activities fall within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the United States, which exempts from patent infringement liability activities reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA. As our clinical investigational drug product candidates progress toward commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. While we attempt to ensure that our active clinical investigational drugs and the methods we employ to manufacture them, as well as the methods for their use we intend to promote, do not infringe other parties\u2019 patents and other proprietary rights, we cannot be certain they do not, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event.\nWe may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that our product candidates, or the methods we employ to manufacture them, or the uses for which we intend to promote them, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Our ability to manufacture and commercialize our product candidates may depend on our ability to demonstrate that the manufacturing processes we employ and the use of our product candidates do not infringe third-party patents. If third-party patents were found to cover our product candidates or their use or manufacture, we could be required to pay damages or be enjoined and therefore unable to commercialize our product candidates, unless we obtained a license. A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nIf our competitors are able to develop and market products that are more effective, safer or more affordable than ours, or obtain marketing approval before we do, our commercial opportunities may be limited.\nCompetition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense and continues to increase. Some companies that are larger and have significantly more resources than we do are aggressively pursuing antibacterial development programs, including traditional therapies and therapies with novel mechanisms of action. In addition, other companies are developing phage-based products for non-therapeutic uses, and may elect to use their expertise in phage development and manufacturing to try to develop products that would compete with ours.\nWe also face potential competition from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions engaged in the discovery and development of drugs and therapies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing, sales and marketing than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established pharmaceutical companies.\nOur competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective, have fewer side effects and are safer or more affordable than our product candidates, which would render our product candidates less competitive or noncompetitive. These competitors also compete with us to recruit and retain qualified scientific and management personnel, establish clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as to acquire technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. Moreover, competitors that are able to achieve patent protection, obtain regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before we do, and competitors that have already done so, may enjoy a significant competitive advantage.\nThe Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, is intended to provide incentives for the development of new, qualified infectious disease products. These incentives may result in more competition in the market for new antibiotics, and may cause pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with more resources than we have to shift their efforts towards the development of products that could be competitive with our product candidates.\nThere is a substantial risk of product liability claims in our business. If we do not obtain sufficient liability insurance, a product liability claim could result in substantial liabilities.\nOur business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 delay or failure to complete our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 decreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 injury to our reputation;\n\u00b7 litigation costs;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards against us; and\n\u00b7 diversion of management or other resources from key aspects of our operations.\nIf we succeed in marketing products, product liability claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety or efficacy of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs. An FDA investigation could also potentially lead to a recall of our products or more serious enforcement actions, or limitations on the indications, for which they may be used, or suspension or withdrawal of approval.\nWe have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials up to a $10.0 million annual per claim and aggregate limit. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for our product candidates or any other compound that we may develop. However, insurance coverage is expensive and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or at all, and the insurance coverage that we obtain may not be adequate to cover potential claims or losses.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates, the market may not be receptive to our product candidates upon their commercial introduction, which would negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability.\nOur product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of the product;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u00b7 potential advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7 the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7 the price of the product, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments; and\n\u00b7 sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nIf our product candidates receive regulatory approval but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate product revenues sufficient to attain profitability.\nForeign governments tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, prescription drug pricing is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our profitability will be negatively affected.\nWe may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur research and development activities use biological and hazardous materials that are dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes resulting from these materials. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, state and federal environmental protection agencies and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act. OSHA, state governments or federal Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, may adopt regulations that may affect our research and development programs. We are unable to predict whether any agency will adopt any regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with these laws and regulations.\nAlthough we believe our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could significantly exceed our insurance coverage.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe stock markets in general, the markets for biotechnology stocks and, in particular, the stock price of our common stock, have experienced extreme volatility. The market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to the shares of larger, more established companies that trade on a national securities exchange and have large public floats, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than the shares of such larger, more established companies for the indefinite future. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. Our common shares are, compared to the shares of such larger, more established companies, sporadically and thinly traded. As a consequence of this limited liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of shares of our common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand. We are also a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due to the early stage of our drug development programs and our lack of profits to date, and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our potential products. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a larger, more established company that has a large public float and broader stockholder base. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common shares will be at any time, including as to whether our common stock will sustain their current market prices, or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of common stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.\nPrice declines in our common stock could also result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors, including:\n\u00b7 adverse results or delays in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 adverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our product candidates, clinical trials or the manufacturing processes of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations, patents or new products by our competitors;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u00b7 any lawsuit involving us or our product candidates;\n\u00b7 announcements concerning our competitors, or the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries in general;\n\u00b7 developments concerning any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may enter into;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in recommendations by securities analysts or lack of analyst coverage;\n\u00b7 deviations in our operating results from the estimates of analysts;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock; and\n\u00b7 loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, litigation has often been brought against that company. Any such lawsuit could consume resources and management time and attention, which could adversely affect our business.\nA significant number of shares of our common stock are subject to issuance upon exercise or conversion of outstanding warrants, options and convertible securities, which upon such exercise or conversion may result in dilution to our security holders.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 1,209,649 shares of our common stock at an average exercise price of $8.96 per share, and outstanding options to purchase 669,769 shares of our common stock at an average exercise price of $8.68 per share. The exercise price and/or the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances, including certain issuances of securities at a price equal to or less than the then current exercise price, subdivisions and stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers or sales of properties and assets and upon the issuance of certain assets or securities to holders of our common stock, as applicable. Although we cannot determine when these warrants or options will ultimately be exercised, it is reasonable to assume that such warrants and options will be exercised only if the exercise price is below the market price of our common stock. To the extent any of our outstanding warrants or options are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued that will generally be eligible for resale in the public market (subject to limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act with respect to shares held by our affiliates), which will result in dilution to our security holders. The issuance of additional securities could also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were 7,527,853 outstanding shares of our Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock. Each share of Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock is convertible into 0.20 shares of common stock and accrues dividends at the rate of 10% per year compounded annually. At December 31, 2015, these shares would be convertible into 1,505,571 shares of common stock and the accrued dividends on these shares totaled $2.8 million. These shares of Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock also have certain liquidation preferences that in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation or certain reorganization transactions could have the effect of reducing the value attributable to common stockholders.\nOur principal stockholders and management beneficially own a majority of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Therefore, these stockholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nProvisions of Washington law and our current articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of Washington law and our current articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u00b7 providing for a classified board of directors with staggered terms;\n\u00b7 requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u00b7 eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7 prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u00b7 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Washington, we are governed by the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, which, among other things, restricts the ability of stockholders owning 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would without these provisions.\nAlthough we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, pursuant to our articles of incorporation, we are not permitted to pay cash dividends on our common stock until all accrued dividends on the outstanding Series B shares have been paid in full. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nMaintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules of the NYSE MKT. The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and place strain on our personnel, systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently.\nWe currently do not have an internal audit group, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud.\nIn accordance with NYSE MKT rules, we are required to maintain a majority independent board of directors. The various rules and regulations applicable to public companies make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors will be significantly curtailed.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have two securities analysts and may never obtain additional research coverage by other securities and industry analysts. If no additional securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. If we obtain additional securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined under the JOBS Act. For so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although we may lose such status earlier, depending on the occurrence of certain events. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering conducted after we became a reporting company under the Exchange Act pursuant to our registration statement on Form 10 (File No. 000-23930), (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Exchange Act, which means that the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30th of the prior year, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive or our company less comparable to certain other public companies because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nCertain holders of our common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock by us, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including conducting clinical trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities and costs associated with operating as a public company. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 80577, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ARMP"}
