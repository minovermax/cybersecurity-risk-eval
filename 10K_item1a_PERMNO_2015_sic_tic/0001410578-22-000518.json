{"cik": "910267", "company": "TITAN PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur ProNeura development programs are at very early stages and will require substantial additional resources that may not be available to us.\nTo date, other than our work on Probuphine in OUD and our work on nalmefene, we have conducted only limited research and development activities assessing our ProNeura delivery system\u2019s applicability in other potential indications. While the nalmefene program is being funded in large part by NIDA, there is no assurance that NIDA will continue to provide the necessary funding to complete the regulatory approval process for this product candidate. We will also require substantial additional funds to advance our kappa opioid agonist program beyond the proof-of-concept stage and to support further research and development activities, including the anticipated costs of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and eventual commercialization of any therapeutic based on our ProNeura platform technology. If we are unable to obtain substantial government grants or enter into third party collaborations to fund our ProNeura programs, we will need to seek additional sources of financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining the requisite funding for our ProNeura programs, we could be forced to discontinue product development. Furthermore, funding arrangements with collaborative partners or others may require us to relinquish rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or license rights to technologies, product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available.\nOur ability to successfully develop any future product candidates based on our ProNeura drug delivery technology is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, including: delays in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; failure to receive regulatory approvals; emergence of superior or equivalent products; inability to manufacture on our own, or through any others, product candidates on a commercial scale; and failure to achieve market acceptance. Because of these risks, our research and development efforts may not result in any commercially viable products and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nClinical trials required for new product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain.\nConducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process. The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per trial. Delays associated with products for which we are directly conducting clinical trials may cause us to incur additional operating expenses. The commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including, for example:\n\u25cf inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of qualified materials under cGMP for use in clinical trials;\n\u25cf slower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u25cf failure to recruit a sufficient number of patients; modification of clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf changes in regulatory requirements for clinical trials;\n\u25cf the lack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u25cf the emergence of unforeseen safety issues;\n\u25cf delays, suspension, or termination of the clinical trials due to the institutional review board responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site; and\n\u25cf government or regulatory delays or \u201cclinical holds\u201d requiring suspension or termination of the trials.\nThe results from early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. Accordingly, even if we obtain positive results from early clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future clinical trials. Clinical trials may not demonstrate statistically significant safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates.\nThe failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indications could cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with third parties conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of our products.\nWe depend on third-party laboratories and medical institutions to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials for our products and other third-party organizations to perform data collection and analysis, all of which must maintain both good laboratory and good clinical practices. We also depend upon third party manufacturers for the production of any products we may successfully develop to comply with cGMP of the FDA, which are similarly outside our direct control. If third party laboratories and medical institutions conducting studies of our products fail to maintain both good laboratory and clinical practices, the studies could be delayed or have to be repeated.\nWe face risks associated with product liability lawsuits that could be brought against us.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of human therapeutic products entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. We currently have a limited amount of product liability insurance, which may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us in the event that the use or misuse of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. In the event we are forced to expend significant funds on defending product liability actions, and in the event those funds come from operating capital, we will be required to reduce our business activities, which could lead to significant losses. Adequate insurance coverage may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. If available, we may not be able to maintain any such insurance at sufficient levels of coverage and any such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Whether or not a product liability insurance policy is obtained or maintained in the future, any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources or destroy the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim.\nWe may be unable to protect our patents and proprietary rights.\nOur future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to:\n\u25cf obtain and keep patent protection for our products, methods and technologies on a domestic and international basis;\n\u25cf enforce our patents to prevent others from using our inventions;\n\u25cf maintain and prevent others from using our trade secrets; and\n\u25cf operate and commercialize products without infringing on the patents or proprietary rights of others.\nWe cannot assure you that our patent rights will afford any competitive advantages, and these rights may be challenged or circumvented by third parties. Further, patents may not be issued on any of our pending patent applications in the U.S. or abroad. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before a potential product can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, reducing or eliminating any advantage of the patent. If we sue others for infringing our patents, a court may determine that such patents are invalid or unenforceable. Even if the validity of our patent rights is upheld by a court, a court may not prevent the alleged infringement of our patent rights on the grounds that such activity is not covered by our patent claims.\nIn addition, third parties may sue us for infringing their patents. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to:\n\u25cf pay substantial damages;\n\u25cf stop using our technologies and methods;\n\u25cf stop certain research and development efforts;\n\u25cf develop non-infringing products or methods; and\n\u25cf obtain one or more licenses from third parties.\nIf required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are sued for infringement, we could encounter substantial delays in development, manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates. Any litigation, whether to enforce our patent rights or to defend against allegations that we infringe third party rights, will be costly, time consuming, and may distract management from other important tasks.\nWe also rely in our business on trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information. We seek to protect this information, in part, through the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors and others. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that those agreements will provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information and prevent their unauthorized use or disclosure. To the extent that consultants, key employees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our proposed products, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such information, which may not be resolved in our favor.\nWe must comply with extensive government regulations.\nThe research, development, manufacture, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to an extensive regulatory approval process by the FDA in the U.S. and comparable health authorities in foreign markets. The process of obtaining required regulatory approvals for drugs is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Approval policies or regulations may change, and the FDA and foreign authorities have substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. Regulatory approval may entail limitations on the indicated usage of a drug, which may reduce the drug\u2019s market potential. Even if regulatory clearance is obtained, post-market evaluation of the products, if required, could result in restrictions on a product\u2019s marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the regulatory approval process and are commercialized.\nWe face intense competition.\nWith respect to our product development programs, we face competition from numerous companies that currently market, or are developing, products for the treatment of the diseases and disorders we have targeted, many of which have significantly greater research and development capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources than we have. We also compete with universities and other research institutions in the development of products, technologies and processes, as well as the recruitment of highly qualified personnel. Our competitors may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective than the ones we have under development or that render our proposed products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we will.\nWe depend on a small number of employees and consultants.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of a limited number of personnel and the loss of one or more of such individuals could substantially impair our ongoing commercialization efforts. We compete in our hiring efforts with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and it may be difficult and could take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the range of skills and experience required and because of our limited resources.\nIn addition, we retain scientific and clinical advisors and consultants to assist us in all aspects of our business. Competition to hire and retain consultants from a limited pool is intense. Further, because these advisors are not our employees, they may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, and typically they will not enter into non-compete agreements with us. If a conflict of interest arises between their work for us and their work for another entity, we may lose their services. In addition, our advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours.\nWe face potential liability related to the privacy of health information we obtain from clinical trials sponsored by us or our collaborators, from research institutions and our collaborators, and directly from individuals.\nNumerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. In addition, most health care providers, including research institutions from which we or our collaborators obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics, such as the current COVID-19 global pandemic, that could adversely affect our operations or financial results.\nThe spread of COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, including restrictions on travel, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and state and local governments to mitigate its transmission, has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business. While the duration of the pandemic and its potential economic impact are difficult to predict, it already has caused significant disruption in the healthcare industry and is likely to have continuing impacts as it continues. The travel restrictions, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, quarantine policies, and general concerns about the spread of COVID-19 were a significant factor in our decision to wind down our commercial operations because of the resulting disruptions in the delivery of healthcare to patients, our sales and marketing efforts and REMS training activities, as well as the operations of the various parts of our supply and distribution chain. Although state and local governments began to ease COVID-19 restrictions in the second quarter of 2021, as we have seen with the onset of the Delta and Omicron variants, the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our business, healthcare systems in general or the global economy as a whole will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and may result in a sustained economic downturn that could affect our ability to access capital on reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data. Cybersecurity breaches could expose us to liability, damage our reputation, compromise our confidential information or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data. Our computer systems may be vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack. Security breaches pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our key business partners face similar risks, and a security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. While we continue to invest in data protection and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred net losses in almost every year since our inception, which losses will continue for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred net losses in almost every year since our inception. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net losses of approximately $8.8 million and $18.2 million, respectively, and had net cash used in operating activities of approximately $7.9 million and $17.2 million, respectively. These net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. We expect to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future as we focus on development of ProNeura based products. The amount of future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to obtain government or third-party funding for our development programs.\nWe will require additional proceeds to fund our product development programs and working capital requirements.\nWe currently estimate that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and product development efforts only to the end of the third quarter of 2022. We will require substantial additional funds to advance our kappa opioid agonist program beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and to fund any of our ProNeura development programs, including nalmefene, into the clinic and to complete the regulatory approval process necessary to commercialize any products we might develop. Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. While we are currently evaluating the alternatives available to us, including the possible sale of our Probuphine assets, government grants, third-party collaborations for one or more of our ProNeura programs and potential merger opportunities, our efforts to address our liquidity requirements may not be successful. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any source of capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or will not involve substantial dilution to our stockholders. Our failure to obtain substantial funds in the next several months would likely result in the cessation of one or more of our development programs or the wind-down of our business.\nOur net operating losses and research and development tax credits may not be available to reduce future federal and state income tax payments.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $258.9 million and approximately $7.5 million, respectively, and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $110.6 million and approximately $9.2 million, respectively, available to offset future taxable income, if any. Current federal and state tax laws include substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credits in the event of an ownership change and we cannot assure you that our net operating loss and tax carryforwards will continue to be available.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile, which could prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above your purchase price.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf results of our product development efforts;\n\u25cf regulatory actions with respect to our products under development or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors\u2019 operating results or growth rate;\n\u25cf announcements by us, our potential future collaborators or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u25cf issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u25cf announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u25cf market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general; and\n\u25cf general economic and market conditions.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock and could subject us to securities class action litigation.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions provide that:\n\u25cf the authorized number of directors can be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u25cf our bylaws may be amended or repealed by our board of directors or our stockholders;\n\u25cf stockholders may not call special meetings of the stockholders or fill vacancies on the board of directors;\n\u25cf our board of directors is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our board of directors does not approve;\n\u25cf our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights, and therefore our stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding will be able to elect all of our directors; and\n\u25cf our stockholders must comply with advance notice provisions to bring business before or nominate directors for election at a stockholder meeting.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nDuring 2020, we received several notices from the Listing Qualifications Department the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, regarding the fact that the market price of our common stock was below the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing. As a result of the reverse stock split we effected on November 30, 2020, we were able to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement and remain listed on Nasdaq. We have also previously received notices of noncompliance due to our failure to maintain the $2,500,000 minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement for continued listing. We were able to regain compliance with that requirement through capital raises and our discontinuation of the expenses associated with Probuphine commercial operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to meet all of the criteria necessary for Nasdaq to allow us to remain listed. For example, our share price has recently fallen below the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing.\nIf our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, our common stock would likely then trade only in the over-the- counter market. If our common stock were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; a determination that our shares are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our securities to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; a reduced amount of news and analyst coverage for our Company; and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock and would substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\nIn addition to the foregoing, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the- counter market, the application of the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. If our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the- counter market at a price of less than $5.00 per share, our common stock would be considered a penny stock. The SEC\u2019s penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that before a transaction in a penny stock occurs, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s agreement to the transaction. If applicable in the future, these rules may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares, until our common stock no longer is considered a penny stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well.\nSales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur in the future. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe will seek to raise additional funds and may finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing securities that would dilute your ownership. Depending on the terms available to us, if these activities result in significant dilution, it may negatively impact the trading price of our shares of common stock.\nWe have financed our operations, and we expect to continue seeking to finance our operations, acquisitions, if any, and the development of strategic relationships by issuing equity and/or convertible securities, which could significantly reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Further, any additional financing that we secure, including any debt financing, may require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to, or pari passu with, those of our common stock. Any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or the issuance or sale of other securities or instruments senior to our shares of common stock. The holders of any securities or instruments we may issue may have rights superior to the rights of our common stockholders. If we experience dilution from the issuance of additional securities and we grant superior rights to new securities over common stockholders, it may negatively impact the trading price of our shares of common stock and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends and have no plans to pay any cash dividends in the future.\nHolders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors. To date, we have paid no cash dividends on our shares of our preferred or common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in\nthe foreseeable future. In addition, the declaration and payment of cash dividends is restricted under the terms of our existing Loan Agreement. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, to provide funds for operations of our business. Therefore, any return investors in our preferred or common stock may have will be in the form of appreciation, if any, in the market value of their shares of common stock.", "PERMNO": 82848, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "TTNP"}
