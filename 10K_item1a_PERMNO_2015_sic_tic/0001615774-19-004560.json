RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which will affect our ability to obtain future financing and may require us to curtail our operations.\nOur financial statements as of December 31, 2018 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. The independent registered public accounting firm that audited our 2018 financial statements, in their report, included an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses since inception and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to achieve any of the foregoing.\nWe have incurred substantial operating losses in each year since our inception and expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable or, if achieved, be able to sustain profitability.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses without corresponding revenues unless and until we expand our commercialization efforts. To date, as part of our limited pilot launch in the U.S. market, we have generated limited revenue from our Pure-Vu System, but we do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we expand our commercialization efforts, which is subject to significant uncertainty. We expect to incur significant marketing expenses in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and there can be no assurance that we will generate significant revenues or ever achieve profitability. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was approximately $22.3 million and $13.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $61.4 million.\nOur cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will only fund our operations for a limited time and we will need to raise additional capital to support our development and commercialization efforts.\nWe are currently operating at a loss and expect our operating costs will increase significantly as we incur costs associated with commercialization activities related to our Pure-Vu System. Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in their report on our financial statements. At December 31, 2018, we had a cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance of approximately $21.1 million. Based on our current business plan, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance as of December 31, 2018, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through the fourth quarter of 2019.\nIf our available cash balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including due to risks described herein, we may seek to raise additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations or licensing arrangements. We will need to raise additional capital, and we may also consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities, or for other reasons, including to:\n\u25cf fund development and efforts of any future products;\n\u25cf acquire, license or invest in technologies;\n\u25cf acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and\n\u25cf finance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf our revenue growth rate and ability to generate cash flows from operating activities;\n\u25cf our sales and marketing and research and development activities;\n\u25cf costs of and potential delays in product development;\n\u25cf changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products; and\n\u25cf costs related to international expansion.\nWe do not currently have any arrangements or credit facilities in place as a source of funds, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, and if we are not successful in raising additional capital, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and strategic collaborations. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, that could increase our expenses and require that our assets secure such debt. Equity financing, if obtained, could result in dilution to our then existing stockholders and/or require such stockholders to waive certain rights and preferences. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We can provide no assurances that any additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, if we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our operations, we might have to enter into strategic collaborations that could require us to share commercial rights to the Pure-Vu System with third parties in ways that we currently do not intend or on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we choose to pursue additional indications and/or geographies for the Pure-Vu System or otherwise expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate, we may also need to raise additional capital sooner than expected.\nFuture capital raises may dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership and/or have other adverse effects on our operations.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership will be reduced and these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights senior to those of our Common Stock and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations, including liens on our assets. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or products, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nEffective on December 1, 2016, Motus G.I. Medical Technologies LTD, and the holders of all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Motus G.I. Medical Technologies LTD (the \u201cLTD Stockholders\u201d), entered into a share exchange agreement (the \u201cShare Exchange Agreement\u201d) with us. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, as a condition of and contemporaneously with the initial closing (the \u201cInitial Closing\u201d) of the 2017 Private Placement, the LTD Stockholders sold to us, and we acquired, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Motus G.I. Medical Technologies LTD (the \u201cShare Exchange Transaction\u201d) and Motus G.I. Medical Technologies LTD became our direct wholly-owned subsidiary As a result of the Share Exchange Transaction, our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss, carryforwards and federal tax credit may be limited under Sections 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The limitations apply if an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined by Section 382, occurs. Generally, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect \u201cfive percent shareholders\u201d increases by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during the applicable testing period (typically three years). In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an \u201cownership change\u201d and, consequently, Section 382 limitations. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset United States federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the statute originally named the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) which enacts a broad range of changes to the Code. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and net operating losses, allows for the expensing of certain capital expenditures, and puts into effect a number of changes impacting operations outside of the United States including, but not limited to, the imposition of a one-time tax on accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income that has not previously been subject to tax, and modifications to the treatment of certain intercompany transactions. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. We have revalued our net deferred tax assets and liabilities at the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rate, resulting in a write-down of our gross deferred tax assets of approximately $0.4 million as of December 31, 2017. We continue to examine the impact this tax legislation, as well as any additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, may have on our business. The impact of this tax legislation on holders of our Common Stock is uncertain and could be adverse. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our Common Stock.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Third-Party Reimbursement\nWe are subject to complex and costly regulation.\nOur product, and any products we may develop in the future, are subject to regulation by the FDA and other national, supranational, federal and state governmental authorities. It can be costly and time-consuming to obtain regulatory clearance and/or approval to market a new or modified medical device or other product. Clearance and/or approval might not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Regulations are subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action, which may further increase our costs or reduce sales. Unless an exception applies, the FDA requires that the manufacturer of a new medical device or a new indication for use of, or other significant change in, an existing medical device obtain either FDA 510(k) pre-market clearance or pre-market approval before that product can be marketed or sold in the United States. Modifications or enhancements to a product that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, technology, materials, labeling, packaging, or manufacturing process may also require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly premarket approval. The FDA has indicated that it intends to continue to enhance its pre-market requirements for medical devices. Although we cannot predict with certainty the future impact of these initiatives, it appears that the time and cost to get medical devices to market could increase significantly.\nIn addition, we are subject to regulations that govern manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising, and adverse-event reporting that apply after we have obtained clearance or approval to sell a product. Our failure to maintain clearance for our Pure-Vu System, to obtain clearance or approval for new or modified products, or to adhere to regulations for manufacturing, labeling, advertising or adverse event reporting could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, if we determine a product manufactured or marketed by us does not meet our specifications, published standards or regulatory requirements, we may seek to correct the product or withdraw the product from the market, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Many of our facilities and procedures, and those of our suppliers are subject to ongoing oversight, including periodic inspection by governmental authorities. Compliance with production, safety, quality control and quality assurance regulations can be costly and time-consuming.\nThe sales and marketing of medical devices is under increased scrutiny by the FDA and other enforcement bodies. If our sales and marketing activities fail to comply with FDA regulations or guidelines, or other applicable laws, we may be subject to warnings or enforcement actions from the FDA or other enforcement bodies.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain governmental approvals to market our Pure-Vu System outside the United States and the European Union countries.\nTo be able to market and sell our Pure-Vu System in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations of those countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Many non-European markets, including major markets in South America and Asia Pacific, have allowed for expedited regulatory review and approval based on an existing CE Mark. We have affixed a CE Mark to our Pure-Vu System in the EU in February 2018, and intend to target countries with a regulatory approval process with similar requirements to CE Mark. However, obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals are complex and expensive and subject to delays, and management cannot be certain that we will receive and be able to maintain regulatory approvals in any foreign country in which we plan to market our Pure-Vu System or in the time frame in which we expect.\nModifications to our product may require new 510(k) clearance or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until approvals are obtained.\nAfter a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly premarket approval. Changes that do not rise to this level of significance, including certain manufacturing changes, may be made without FDA clearance upon documentation in the manufacturer\u2019s files of the determination of the significance of the change. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with the manufacturer\u2019s determination. If the FDA disagrees with any determination that we may make in the future and requires us to seek new 510(k) clearance for modifications to any previously approved or cleared products for which we have concluded that new approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or distribution of our products or to recall the modified product until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. In the future we may seek to expand the indication for which the Pure-Vu System is cleared or approved to allow us to actively promote the product and a less-prep regimen to patients. This would require us to perform one or more clinical trials to facilitate the approval of such expanded labeling, however, if such trials are unsuccessful or the FDA denies our expanded labeling, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nIn the European Union/European Economic Area (the \u201cEU/EEA\u201d), we will be required to inform the Notified Body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices we market or sell in the EEA of any planned changes to our quality system or changes to our devices which could affect compliance with the essential requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Directive or the devices\u2019 intended purpose. The Notified Body will then assess the changes and verify whether they affect the products\u2019 conformity with the essential requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Directive or the conditions for the use of the device. If the assessment is favorable, the Notified Body will issue a new CE Certificate of Conformity or an addendum to the existing CE Certificate of Conformity attesting compliance with the essential requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Directive. If it is not, we may not be able to market and sell the product in the EEA.\nIf our product malfunctions, or causes or contributes to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our product also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results. Similar strict regulatory requirements concerning safety reporting and post-market surveillance obligations apply in the EU.\nOur Pure-Vu System may in the future be subject to product recalls. A recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, including a third-country authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within ten working days after the recall is initiated. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or a distributor could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. A recall of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our product in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be subject to liability claims, be required to bear other costs, or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA or another third-country competent authority. We may initiate voluntary recalls that we determine do not require notification of the FDA or another third-country competent authority. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls.\nWe are also required to follow detailed recordkeeping requirements for all firm-initiated medical device corrections and removals. In addition, in October 2014, the FDA issued guidance intended to assist the FDA and industry in distinguishing medical device recalls from product enhancements. Per the guidance, if any change or group of changes to a device addresses a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFDCA\u201d), that change would generally constitute a medical device recall and require submission of a recall report to the FDA. Similar strict regulatory requirements concerning medical device recall and related reporting obligations apply in the EU.\nOur Pure-Vu System is not currently reimbursable through private or governmental third-party payors, which could limit market acceptance.\nOur Pure-Vu System and the procedure to cleanse the colon in preparation for colonoscopy are not currently reimbursable through private or governmental third-party payors in any country. We intend to seek reimbursement through private or governmental third-party payors in the future, however coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we commercialize and, even if available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. The commercialization of our Pure-Vu System depends on prospective patients\u2019 ability to cover the costs of the procedure, and/or physician willingness to subsidize all or some of the costs of the procedure. We believe that a substantial portion of individuals who are candidates for the use of the Pure-Vu System worldwide do not have the financial means to cover its cost. Moreover, healthcare providers may be reluctant to make the initial investment in the system. A general regional or worldwide economic downturn could negatively impact demand for our Pure-Vu System. In the event that medically eligible patients deem the costs of our procedure to be prohibitively high or consider alternative treatment options to be more affordable, or healthcare providers deem the cost of the system to be too high, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted.\nIf we or our sales personnel or distributors do not comply with fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws for any products approved in the U.S., or with similar foreign laws where we market our products, we could face significant liability.\nThere are numerous federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws, false claims, and physician transparency laws. Our relationships with physicians and surgeons, hospitals and our independent distributors are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including significant fines, damages and monetary penalties and in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.\nMany foreign countries have enacted similar laws addressing fraud and abuse in the healthcare sector. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance requirements in multiple jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nWe may become liable for significant damages or be restricted from selling our products if we engage in inappropriate promotion of our Pure-Vu System.\nOur promotional materials and training methods for our Pure-Vu System must comply with FDA and other foreign applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of the \u201coff-label\u201d use of our Pure-Vu System, including by using our Pure-Vu System in a way not approved by the FDA or not consistent with the intended purpose for which Pure-Vu System is CE marked in the EU. The Pure-Vu System is currently indicated to connect to standard colonoscopes to facilitate intra-procedural cleaning of a poorly prepared colon by irrigating or cleaning the colon and evacuating the irrigated fluid, feces and other bodily fluids and matter. We do not currently promote a particular prep regimen as this is left up to the discretion of the physician since our current indication does not reference any preparation protocol. Healthcare providers may use our products off-label, as the FDA or the competent authorities in the EU Member States do not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA or a competent authority in an EU Member State determines that our promotional materials, training or marketing efforts constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or marketing efforts or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties. Although we do not intend to engage in any activities that may be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged, directly or indirectly, in off-label promotion. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us and harm our reputation.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in the healthcare reform laws.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) imposes, among other things, an excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, although this tax has been suspended for calendar years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. It is unclear at this time if the moratorium will be further extended. We anticipate that primarily all of our sales of our Pure-Vu System in the United States will be subject to this 2.3% excise tax after December 31, 2019. Additionally, Congress could terminate the moratorium or further change the law related to the medical device tax in a manner that could adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur Pure-Vu System is currently our sole product and we are completely dependent on the successful marketing and sale of this product. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop any additional products.\nOur Pure-Vu System, inclusive of the Pure-Vu Slim Sleeve and Gen 2, is currently our sole product and we are completely dependent on the success of this product. We may fail to successfully commercialize our product. Successfully commercializing medical devices such as ours is a complex and uncertain process, dependent on the efforts of management, distributors, outside consultants, physicians and general economic conditions, among other factors. Any factors that adversely impact the commercialization of our Pure-Vu System, including, but not limited to, competition or acceptance in the marketplace, will have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing or commercializing any potential enhancements to our Pure-Vu System or any other products. Our inability to successfully commercialize our Pure-Vu System and/or successfully develop and commercialize additional products or any enhancements to our Pure-Vu System which we may develop would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a medical technology company with a limited operating history.\nWe are a medical technology company with a limited operating history. We received clearance from the FDA, and CE Mark approval in Europe, for our Pure-Vu System and are preparing for a planned full launch of the Pure-Vu System in the United States inpatient colonoscopy market in 2019. We expect that sales of our Pure-Vu System will account for substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future. However, we have limited experience in selling our products and we may be unable to successfully commercialize our Pure-Vu System for a number of reasons, including:\n\u25cf market acceptance of our Pure-Vu System by physicians and patients will largely depend on our ability to demonstrate its relative safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness and ease of use;\n\u25cf our inexperience in marketing, selling and distributing our products;\n\u25cf we may not have adequate financial or other resources to successfully commercialize our Pure-Vu System;\n\u25cf we may not be able to manufacture our Pure-Vu System in commercial quantities or at an acceptable cost;\n\u25cf the uncertainties associated with establishing and qualifying a manufacturing facility;\n\u25cf patients will not generally receive reimbursement from third-party payors for the use of our Pure-Vu System for colon cleansing, which may reduce widespread use of our Pure-Vu System;\n\u25cf the introduction and market acceptance of competing products and technologies; and\n\u25cf rapid technological change may make our Pure-Vu System obsolete.\nPotential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a company with a limited operating history will face. In particular, potential investors should consider that we cannot assure you that we will be able to:\n\u25cf successfully execute our current business plan for the commercialization of our Pure-Vu System, or that our business plan is sound;\n\u25cf successfully contract for and establish a commercial supply of our product;\n\u25cf achieve market acceptance of our Pure-Vu System; and\n\u25cf attract and retain an experienced management and advisory team.\nIf we cannot successfully execute any one of the foregoing, our business may not succeed and your investment will be adversely affected.\nThe Pure-Vu System may not be accepted by physicians and patients.\nOur Pure-Vu System for use during colonoscopy screenings to clean the colon through irrigation and evacuation of bowel contents is a new technology and may be perceived as more invasive than current colonoscopy screening procedures, and patients may be unwilling to undergo the procedure. Moreover, patients may be unwilling to depart from the current standard of care. In addition, physicians tend to be slow to change their medical treatment practices because of perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products. Physicians may not recommend or prescribe our Pure-Vu System until there is long-term clinical evidence to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods, there are recommendations from prominent physicians that our Pure-Vu System is safe and efficient and reimbursement or insurance coverage is available. We cannot predict when, if ever, physicians and patients may adopt the use of our Pure-Vu System. If our Pure-Vu System does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by patients, physicians and healthcare payors, we may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable.\nIf we are not able to successfully commercialize our Pure-Vu System, the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, may be limited.\nThe commercial success of our Pure-Vu System will depend upon its acceptance by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance of our Pure-Vu System will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf relative convenience, burden and ease of administration;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u25cf the willingness of physicians to prescribe the Pure-Vu System and of the target patient population to try new procedures;\n\u25cf efficacy of our Pure-Vu System compared to competing procedures;\n\u25cf the introduction of any new products and procedures that may in the future become available for colonoscopy preparation may be approved;\n\u25cf pricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf the inclusion or omission of our Pure-Vu System in applicable treatment guidelines;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in FDA-approved labeling;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors; and\n\u25cf the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nIf our Pure-Vu System does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our Pure-Vu System may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nWe currently have a limited sales and marketing organization. If we are unable to secure a sales and marketing partner and/or establish satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities, we may not successfully commercialize our Pure-Vu System.\nAt present, we have limited sales or marketing personnel. In order to commercialize devices that are approved for commercial sales, we must either collaborate with third parties that have such commercial infrastructure and/or continue to develop our own sales and marketing infrastructure. If we are not successful entering into appropriate collaboration arrangements, recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our Pure-Vu System, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. If we elect to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure we may not realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we will have to compete with established and well-funded medical device companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our Pure-Vu System without strategic partners or licensees include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to use our Pure-Vu System;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nOur Pure-Vu System may cause adverse side effects that prevent its widespread adoption or that may necessitate its withdrawal from the market.\nOur Pure-Vu System is currently believed to have the same side effects as a standard colonoscopy, such as inducing trauma to the colon\u2019s mucosa or, in rare cases, perforation of the colon. With more extensive use, the Pure-Vu System may be found to cause additional undesirable and unintended side effects or show a higher rate of side effects than a standard colonoscopy that may prevent or limit its commercial adoption and use. Even upon receiving clearance from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, our products may later exhibit adverse side effects that prevent widespread use or necessitate withdrawal from the market. The manifestation of such side effects could cause our business to suffer.\nIf we do not convince gastroenterologists that our products are attractive alternatives to the currently marketed medical devices and suitable for use in addressing bowel preparation or cleansing, we will not be commercially successful.\nIf we are not successful in convincing gastroenterologists of the merits of our products or educating them on the use of our products, they may not use our products and we will be unable to fully commercialize our products or reach profitability. Gastroenterologists may be hesitant to change their medical treatment practices for the following reasons, among others:\n\u25cf lack of experience with our products and concerns regarding potential side effects;\n\u25cf lack of clinical data currently available to support the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u25cf lack or perceived lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits;\n\u25cf perceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures; and\n\u25cf the time commitment that may be required for training.\nIn addition, we believe recommendations and support of our products by influential gastroenterologists are important for market acceptance and adoption. If we do not receive support from such gastroenterologists or long term data does not show the benefits of using our products, gastroenterologists may not use our products. In such circumstances, we may not be able to grow our revenues or achieve profitability.\nIf we are unable to train gastroenterologists and their clinical staff on the safe and appropriate use of our products, we may be unable to achieve revenue growth or profitability.\nAn important part of our sales process includes the ability to train gastroenterologists and their clinical staff on the safe and appropriate use of our products. We have very limited experience in training and retaining qualified independent gastroenterologists to perform the colon cleansing procedure using our Pure-Vu System. If we are unable to attract gastroenterologists to our training programs, it may lead to a higher rate of injury, negative publicity and an increased risk of product liability, which would adversely affect our growth or profitability.\nThere is a learning process involved in gastroenterologists and their clinical staff becoming proficient in the use of our products. It is critical to the success of our commercialization efforts to train a sufficient number of gastroenterologists and to provide them with adequate instruction in the use of our Pure-Vu System. This training process may take longer than expected and may therefore affect our ability to increase sales. Following completion of training, we expect to rely on the trained gastroenterologists to advocate the benefits of our products in the broader marketplace. Convincing gastroenterologists to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging, and we cannot assure you we will be successful in these efforts. If gastroenterologists and their clinical staff are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products. Such uses may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may face competition from other medical device companies in the future and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe medical device industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly evolving technology and intense research and development efforts. We have competitors in a number of jurisdictions that have substantially greater name recognition, commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. Established competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel devices or procedures that could make our Pure-Vu System obsolete or uneconomical. Any new product that competes with a cleared medical device may need to demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, cost, convenience, tolerability and safety to be commercially successful. Other competitive factors could force us to lower prices or could result in reduced sales, including increased use of alternatives to colonoscopies such as capsule endoscopy systems, virtual colonoscopies using a CT scan, and other similar screening tests for colon cancer. While none of these testing alternatives may ever fully replace the colonoscopy, over time, they may take market share away from conventional colonoscopies for specific purposes and may lower the potential market opportunity for us. In addition, new devices developed by others could emerge as competitors to our Pure-Vu System. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nOur products face the risk of technological obsolescence, which, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change. There can be no assurance that third parties will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective than ours or that would render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Additionally, new, less invasive surgical procedures and medications could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current procedures that use or could use our products. Accordingly, our success will depend in part upon our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes through the development of new products. Product development involves a high degree of risk, and we cannot assure you that our new product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products.\nIf defects are discovered in our products, we may incur additional unforeseen costs, hospitals may not purchase our products and our reputation may suffer.\nOur products incorporate mechanical parts, any of which can contain errors or failures, especially when first introduced. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after commercial shipment. Because our products are designed to be used to perform medical procedures, we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects. We cannot provide any assurances that our products will not experience component aging, errors or performance problems in the future. If we experience flaws or performance problems, any of the following could occur:\n\u25cf delays in product shipments;\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf delay in market acceptance;\n\u25cf diversion of our resources;\n\u25cf damage to our reputation;\n\u25cf product recalls;\n\u25cf regulatory actions;\n\u25cf increased service or warranty costs; or\n\u25cf product liability claims.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to penetrate foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\nOur future profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize our Pure-Vu System in foreign markets for which we intend to rely on collaborations with third parties. If we commercialize our Pure-Vu System in foreign markets, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf our customers\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement for our Pure-Vu System in foreign markets;\n\u25cf our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties;\n\u25cf the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements;\n\u25cf different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n\u25cf import or export licensing requirements;\n\u25cf longer accounts receivable collection times;\n\u25cf longer lead times for shipping;\n\u25cf language barriers for technical training;\n\u25cf reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u25cf the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.\nForeign sales of our Pure-Vu System could also be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are, and will be, completely dependent on third parties to manufacture our Pure-Vu System, and our commercialization of our Pure-Vu System could be halted, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain or maintain manufacturing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of our Pure-Vu System device components or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the capability or infrastructure to manufacture our Pure-Vu System, as well as the other related device components for high volume commercial purposes. We do have capability to produce limited units for use in our clinical trials, if required. As a result, we are obligated to rely on contract manufacturers for the commercial supply of our product. We currently rely on several manufacturing partners, however we anticipate engaging additional manufacturers for the production of the components of our Pure-Vu System as we expand our commercialization efforts.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture the Pure-Vu System must be compliant with FDA Quality System Regulation requirements and registered with the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMPs\u201d) for manufacture of medical devices, as issued in the Quality System Regulation (21 CFR Part 820). These cGMPs regulations cover all aspects of the manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to the Pure-Vu System. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture products that conform to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to maintain regulatory approval for or market the Pure-Vu System.\nOur contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. We will not have control over our contract manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure by any of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure to market the Pure-Vu System, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business. In addition, we will not have control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Failure by our contract manufacturers to comply with or maintain any of these standards could adversely affect our ability to maintain regulatory approval for or market our Pure-Vu System.\nIf, for any reason, these third parties are unable or unwilling to perform, we may not be able to terminate our agreements with them, and we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers or enter into favorable agreements with them and we cannot be certain that any such third parties will have the manufacturing capacity to meet future requirements. If these manufacturers, or any alternate manufacturers, experience any significant difficulties in their respective manufacturing processes for our product or should cease doing business with us, we could experience significant interruptions in supply or may not be able to create or maintain a commercial supply. Were we to encounter manufacturing issues, our ability to produce sufficient commercial supply might be negatively affected. Our inability to coordinate the efforts of our third party manufacturing partners or the lack of capacity available at our third party manufacturing partners, could impair our ability to supply our Pure-Vu System at required levels. If we face these or other difficulties with our manufacturing partners we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of our products if we decided to transfer the manufacture to one or more alternative manufacturers in an effort to deal with the difficulties.\nAny manufacturing problem or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in lost sales. Any reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical components and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to a future contract manufacturer caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of our Pure-Vu System, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales.\nThe manufacture of our Pure-Vu System, and the technology developed thereunder, is subject to certain Israeli government regulations which may impair our ability to outsource or transfer development or manufacturing activities with respect to any product or technology outside of Israel.\nWe have received, and may receive in the future, grants from the Government of the State of Israel through the IIA for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures pursuant to the IIA Regulations.\nThe terms of the IIA Regulations also require that products developed with IIA grants be manufactured in Israel at a rate (scope) which will not be less than the rate of manufacturing and added value in Israel that were included in the grant application submitted to the IIA. Furthermore, the IIA Regulations additionally require that the knowhow resulting from research and development according to an IIA-approved plan, not being the product developed within the framework of such approved plan, and any right deriving therefrom may not be transferred outside of Israel (including by way of certain licenses), unless prior approval is received from the IIA, which we intend to apply for but may not be granted. Even if such approval is granted, the transfer outside of Israel of manufacturing which is connected with the IIA-funded know-how may result in increased royalties (up to three times the aggregate amount of the IIA grants plus interest thereon), as well as in a higher royalty repayment rate. In addition, the transfer outside of Israel of IIA-funded know-how may trigger additional payments to the IIA (up to six times the aggregate amount of the IIA grants plus interest thereon). Even following the full repayment of any IIA grants, we must nevertheless continue to comply with the requirements of the IIA Regulations. The foregoing restrictions and requirements for payment may impair our ability to transfer or sell our technology assets outside of Israel or to outsource or transfer development or manufacturing activities with respect to any IIA-funded product or technology outside of Israel.\nFurthermore, companies that receive IIA funding are required to ensure that all rights in the IIA-backed product are retained by them. This means that all knowhow which is derived from the research and development conducted pursuant to an IIA approved plan, and every right derived from it, must be owned by the recipient of the IIA funding from the date such knowhow is generated. Companies that receive IIA funding are further subject to reporting requirements and other technical requirements, which are intended to allow the IIA to ensure that the IIA Regulations are being complied with.\nIf we fail to comply with any of the conditions and restrictions imposed by the IIA Regulations, or by the specific terms under which we received the grants, we may be required to refund any grants previously received together with interest and penalties, and, in certain circumstances, may be subject to criminal charges.\nFor additional information, see \u201cPart I-Item 1A - Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Operations in Israel.\u201d\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will remain valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. In addition, our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the United States, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us.\nCompetitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, or if we are unable to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue.\nWe may in the future be a party to patent litigation and administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell our Pure-Vu System.\nLitigation related to infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable, can be expensive and time consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. If we lose this kind of litigation, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, and prohibit us from using technologies essential to our Pure-Vu System, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If relevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe, we could be prevented from selling our Pure-Vu System unless we can obtain a license to use technology or ideas covered by such patents or are able to redesign our Pure-Vu System to avoid infringement. We do not know whether any necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all, or whether we could redesign our Pure-Vu System or processes to avoid infringement.\nCompeting products may also appear in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit, we could be prevented from marketing our Pure-Vu System in one or more foreign countries.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we employ and plan to employ individuals who were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject in the future to claims that our employees or prospective employees are subject to a continuing obligation to their former employers (such as non-competition or non-solicitation obligations) or claims that our employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nGeneral Company-Related Risks\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 44 full time employees. As our marketing and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we will need to expand the size of our employee and consultant base for managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. In addition, our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize the Pure-Vu System and any other future product candidates and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our future growth.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to manage our operations as we advance our product candidates through clinical trials and to expand our development or regulatory capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. Failure to achieve any of these goals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. In addition, the loss of the services of certain key employees would adversely impact our business prospects.\nWe depend on key members of our management team. The loss of the services of Tim Moran, our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Pomeranz, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer or any member of our senior management team, could harm our ability to execute our commercial strategy for our Pure-Vu System and the strategic objectives for our company. We entered into employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, but these agreements are terminable by the employees on short or no notice at any time without or with limited penalty. In addition, we do not maintain, and have no current intention of obtaining, \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance on any member of our management team.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific and commercial personnel, including sales and marketing executives and field personnel, is also critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous medical device and pharmaceutical companies for similar personnel and based on our company profile. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions. If we fail to recruit and then retain these personnel, we may not be able to effectively execute our commercial strategy for the Pure-Vu System.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of the Pure-Vu System.\nWe are, and may be in the future, subject to product liability claims and lawsuits, including potential class actions, alleging that our products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could be costly to defend and could result in settlement payments and adjustments not covered by or in excess of insurance. In addition, we may not be able to obtain insurance on terms acceptable to us or at all because insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain. Our failure to successfully defend against product liability claims or maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nExchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Israeli New Shekel (the \u201cNIS\u201d) and inflation may negatively affect our earnings and we may not be able to hedge our currency exchange risks successfully.\nThe U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. However, a portion of our operating expenses, including personnel and facilities related expenses, are incurred in NIS. As a result, we are exposed to the risks that the NIS may appreciate relative to the U.S. dollar, or, if the NIS instead devalues relative to the U.S. dollar, that the inflation rate in Israel may exceed such rate of devaluation of the NIS, or that the timing of such devaluation may lag behind inflation in Israel. In any such event, the dollar cost of our operations in Israel would increase and our dollar-denominated results of operations would be adversely affected. Given our general lack of currency hedging arrangements to protect us from fluctuations in the exchange rates of the NIS and other foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar (and/or from inflation of such foreign currencies), we may be exposed to material adverse effects from such movements. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation in Israel or the rate of devaluation (if any) of the NIS against the U.S. dollar.\nWe may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies that could negatively affect our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of businesses and assets. We also may pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage our intellectual property and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution. We have no history of acquiring other companies or with forming strategic partnerships. We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions also could result in the issuance of equity securities, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or future write-offs of intangible assets or goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that we would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may experience losses related to investments in other companies, which could have a material negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance, or joint venture.\nTo finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue shares of our Common Stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If the price of our Common Stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using our stock as consideration.\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock\nOur officers, directors, and principal stockholders exercise significant control over our Company, and will control our company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur officers, directors, entities controlled by our officers and directors, and principal stockholders who beneficially own more than 5% of our Common Stock, in the aggregate, beneficially own shares representing approximately 62.72% of our outstanding capital stock as of March 1, 2019. As a result, such entities and individuals have the ability, acting together, to control the election of our directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as: (i) a merger or a sale of our company, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and (iii) amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. This concentration of voting power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders and be disadvantageous to our stockholders with interests different from those entities and individuals. These individuals also have significant control over our business, policies and affairs as officers and directors of our company.\nOur quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations.\nTo date, as part of our limited pilot launch in the U.S. market, we have generated limited revenue from our Pure-Vu System, but we do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we expand our commercialization efforts, which is subject to significant uncertainty, and accordingly we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results in the future. The rate of market acceptance of our Pure-Vu System could contribute to this quarterly variability. Our limited operating history complicates our ability to project quarterly revenue and any future revenue generated from sales of our Pure-Vu System may fluctuate from time to time. In addition, our expense levels are based, in part, on expectation of future revenue levels. A shortfall in expected revenue, if any, could, therefore, result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income. As a result, our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations.\nAn active trading market for our Common Stock may not be sustained.\nPrior to the closing of our IPO on February 16, 2018, there had been no public market for our Common Stock. Although our Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the market for our shares has demonstrated varying levels of trading activity. Furthermore, the current level of trading may not be sustained in the future. The lack of an active market for our Common Stock may impair investors\u2019 ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable, may reduce the fair market value of their shares and may impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire additional intellectual property assets by using our shares as consideration.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could cause the market price of our Common Stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nOur stock price could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Common Stock or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nIn addition, in the future, we may issue additional shares of Common Stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into Common Stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our Common Stock, the price of our Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our Common Stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our Common Stock or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nOur share price may be volatile, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and our stockholders could incur substantial losses.\nThe market price for our Common Stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public;\n\u25cf issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; additions or departures of key management or other personnel;\n\u25cf disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u25cf announcement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n\u25cf sales of our Common Stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders; and\n\u25cf general economic, market or political conditions in the United States or elsewhere.\nIn particular, the market prices of early commercial-stage companies like ours have been highly volatile due to factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf any delay or failure to conduct a clinical trial for our product or receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory agents;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning our product\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf our or our competitors\u2019 technological innovations;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies or patents;\n\u25cf failure to complete significant transactions or collaborate with vendors in manufacturing our product; and\n\u25cf proposals for legislation that would place restrictions on the price of medical therapies.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of Common Stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Common Stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and NASDAQ Capital Markets and emerging growth companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nPursuant to the terms of our outstanding Royalty Payment Rights Certificates and our outstanding Placement Agent Royalty Payment Rights Certificates, we may be obligated to pay significant royalties.\nPursuant to the terms of the Royalty Payment Rights Certificates (as defined in \u201cPart III-Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence- Royalty Payment Rights Certificates - Related Party Participation\u201d) which were issued in connection with the conversion of all of our outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock upon the consummation of our IPO, we may be required to make certain royalty payments. After we generate sales of the current and potential future versions of the Pure-Vu System, including disposables, parts, and services, in excess of $20 million since our inception, then we will be required to pay to the holders of our Royalty Payment Rights Certificates a royalty equal to (i) three percent (3%) of our net sales, if any, in any calendar year, not in excess of $30 million per year. Additionally, after we receive any proceeds from the licensing of the current and potential future versions of the Pure-Vu System in excess of $3.5 million since our inception, then we will be required to pay to the holders of the Royalty Payment Rights Certificates a royalty equal to 5% of our licensing proceeds, if any, in any calendar year, not in excess of $30 million per year. The royalties will be payable up to the later of (i) the latest expiration date for our current patents (which is currently November 2034), or (ii) the latest expiration date of any pending patents as of the date of the initial closing of the 2017 Private Placement that may be issued in the future.\nPursuant to the terms of our Placement Agent Royalty Payment Rights Certificates issued in connection with the 2017 Private Placement, we will be required to pay the holders of the Placement Agent Royalty Payment Rights Certificates, in the aggregate, 10% of the amount of payments paid to the holders of the Royalty Payment Rights Certificates.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and will be able take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d which could make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years from the date of our initial public offering in February 2018, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nWe intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions described above until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Under the JOBS Act, \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nAs a newly public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are required to comply with certain of the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. We expect that compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, after we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined under the JOBS ACT we expect to incur additional management time and cost to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements applicable to companies that are deemed accelerated filers or large accelerated filers, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have not yet completed the process of compiling the system and processing documentation needed to comply with such requirements. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. In that regard, we currently do not have an internal audit function, and we will need to hire or contract for additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge.\nWe cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.\nThere may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud may materially harm our company.\nProper systems of internal controls over financial accounting and disclosure controls and procedures are critical to the operation of a public company. As we have a limited operating history, we only have 5 employees, and 5 contractors in our finance and accounting functions, which may result in a lack of segregation of duties and are at the very early stages of establishing, and we may be unable to effectively establish such systems, especially in light of the fact that we expect to operate as a publicly reporting company. This would leave us without the ability to reliably assimilate and compile financial information about our company and significantly impair our ability to prevent error and detect fraud, all of which would have a negative impact on our company from many perspectives.\nMoreover, we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, even if established, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to remediate the material weakness and otherwise maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nIn connection with the review of our third quarter 2018 financial statements and the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for non-routine complex transactions. Management did not appropriately identify the proper accounting treatment related to contingent payments and stock awards owed to a non-employee. Management has begun remediation by engaging a third party firm with technical accounting specialists to review the accounting for non-routine complex transactions on a prospective basis.\nIn light of the material weakness, we performed additional analyses and other post-closing procedures to ensure our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, our CEO and CFO have certified that, based on their knowledge, the consolidated financial statements, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-K.\nIf our steps are insufficient to successfully remediate the material weakness and otherwise establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our Common Stock could be materially and adversely affected. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nWe may have additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, because of our status as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accountants are not required to provide an attestation report as to our internal control over financial reporting for the foreseeable future.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by our management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as, if applicable, a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or, if applicable, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our Common Stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. We will also be required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis.\nHowever, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, if we take advantage (as we expect to do) of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years from the date of our initial public offering in February 2018, although if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30th before that time, we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the following December 31st. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future.\nAny of the foregoing occurrences, should they come to pass, could negatively impact the public perception of our company, which could have a negative impact on our stock price.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future, and consequently, any gains from an investment in our Common Stock will likely depend on appreciation in the price of our Common Stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. There is no guarantee that shares of our Common Stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nUpon dissolution of our company, our stockholders may not recoup all or any portion of their investment.\nIn the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the proceeds and/or assets of our company remaining after giving effect to such transaction, and the payment of all of our debts and liabilities and distributions required to be made to holders of any outstanding preferred stock will then be distributed to the stockholders of our Common Stock on a pro rata basis. There can be no assurance that we will have available assets to pay to the holders of our Common Stock, or any amounts, upon such a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, allows for our board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Common Stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10 million shares of our preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation and the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of our Common Stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our Common Stock or that is convertible into our Common Stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our Common Stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us, and our directors and officers.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, or any of our officers or directors, arising pursuant to, or a claim against us, or any of our officers or directors, with respect to the interpretation or application of any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation, as amended, or our bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the action may be brought in another state court sitting in the State of Delaware.\nRisks Related to Our Operations in Israel\nOur research and development facilities and some of our suppliers are located in Israel and, therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected by political, economic and military instability in Israel.\nOur research and development facilities are located in northern Israel. In addition, most of our employees are residents of Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect our business. Since the State of Israel was established in 1948, the State of Israel and its economy has experienced significant growth and expansion, coupled with an increase in the standard of living, and has developed one of the most advanced high-tech industries in the world. However, it continues to face many geo-political and other challenges that may affect companies located in Israel, such as ours. For example, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Although Israel has entered into various peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan as well as comprehensive agreements with the Palestinian Authority, there continues to be unrest and terrorist activity in Israel with varying levels of severity, as well as ongoing hostilities and armed conflicts between Israel and the Palestinian Authority and other groups in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, recent unrest was due to the United States\u2019 relocation of its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The effects of these hostilities and violence on the Israeli economy and our operations are unclear, and we cannot predict the effect on us of a further increase in these hostilities or any future armed conflict, political instability or violence in the region. We could be harmed by any major hostilities involving Israel, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners, boycotts or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel. The impact of Israel\u2019s relations with its Arab neighbors in general, or on our operations in the region in particular, remains uncertain. The establishment of new fundamentalist Islamic regimes or governments more hostile to Israel could have serious consequences for the stability in the region, place additional political, economic and military confines upon Israel, materially adversely affect our operations and limit our ability to sell our products to countries in the region.\nAdditionally, several countries, principally in the Middle East, still restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies, and additional countries and groups have imposed or may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and Israeli companies if hostilities in Israel or political instability in the region continues or increases. These restrictions may limit our ability to sell our products to companies in these countries. Furthermore, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, a global campaign attempting to increase economic and political pressure on Israel to comply with the stated goals of the movement, may gain increased traction and result in a boycott of Israeli products and services. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur commercial insurance policy does not cover losses associated with armed conflicts and terrorist attacks. Although the Israeli government in the past covered the reinstatement value of certain damages that were caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained, or if maintained, will be sufficient to compensate us fully for damages incurred. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations could also be disrupted by the obligations of personnel to perform military service. Some of our employees in Israel may be called upon to perform up to 54 days in each three year period (and in the case of military officers, up to 84 days in each three year period) of military reserve duty until they reach the age of 40 (and in some cases, depending on their specific military profession up to 45 or even 49 years of age) and, in certain emergency circumstances, may be called to immediate and unlimited active duty. In response to increases in terrorist activity, there have been periods of significant call-ups of military reservists and it is possible that there will be similar large-scale military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence of a significant number of employees related to military service, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nPursuant to the terms of the Israeli government grants we received for research and development expenditures, we are obligated to pay certain royalties on our revenues to the Israeli government. The terms of the grants require us to satisfy specified conditions and to make additional payments in addition to repayment of the grants upon certain events.\nWe have received, and may receive in the future, grants from the IIA for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures pursuant to the IIA Regulations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had received grants from the IIA in the aggregate amount of $1.332 million, and had a contingent obligation to the IIA up to an aggregate amount of approximately $1.383 million (assuming no increase, per the IIA Regulations, as described below). As of December 31, 2018, we paid a minimal amount to the IIA. We may apply for additional IIA grants in the future. However, as the funds available for IIA grants out of the annual budget of the State of Israel are subject to the pre-approval of the IIA and have been reduced in the past and may be further reduced in the future, we cannot predict whether we will be entitled to - or approved for - any future grants, or the amounts of any such grants (if approved).\nIn exchange for these grants, we are required to pay royalties to the IIA of 3% to 3.5% (which may be increased under certain circumstances) from our revenues generated (in any fashion) from knowhow developed using IIA grants, up to an aggregate of 100% of all such grants (which may be increased under certain circumstances) of the U.S. dollar-linked value of the grant, plus interest at the rate of 12-month LIBOR.\nThe IIA Regulations also require that certain amounts of products developed with IIA grants be manufactured in Israel and that certain technology developed thereunder may not be transferred outside of Israel (including by way of certain licenses), unless prior approval is received from the IIA, which we intend to apply for but may not be granted. Even if such approval is granted, the transfer outside of Israel of manufacturing which is connected with the IIA-funded know-how may result in increased royalties (up to three times the aggregate amount of the IIA grants plus interest thereon), as well as in a higher royalty repayment rate. In addition, the transfer outside of Israel of IIA-funded know-how may trigger additional payments to the IIA (up to six times the aggregate amount of the IIA grants plus interest thereon). Even following the full repayment of any IIA grants, we must nevertheless continue to comply with the requirements of the IIA Regulations. The foregoing restrictions and requirements for payment may impair our ability to transfer or sell our technology assets outside of Israel or to outsource or transfer development or manufacturing activities with respect to any IIA-funded know-how outside of Israel.\nFurthermore, companies that receive IIA funding are required to ensure that all rights in the IIA-backed product are retained by them. This means that all know-how which is derived from the research and development conducted pursuant to an IIA approved plan, and every right derived from it, must be owned by the recipient of the IIA funding from the date such know-how is generated. Companies that receive IIA funding are further subject to reporting requirements and other technical requirements, which are intended to allow the IIA to ensure that the IIA Regulations are being complied with.\nIf we fail to comply with any of the conditions and restrictions imposed by the IIA Regulations, or by the specific terms under which we received the grants, we may be required to refund any grants previously received together with interest and penalties, and, in certain circumstances, may be subject to criminal charges.\nIt may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a U.S. court against us in Israel or the United States to assert U.S. securities laws claims in Israel or to serve process on these experts.\nMotus GI Medical Technologies Ltd., our wholly owned subsidiary, is incorporated in Israel. Our Israeli experts reside in Israel, and substantially all of our technology and intellectual property assets are located in Israel. Therefore, a judgment obtained against us, or any of such persons may not be collectible in the United States and may not be enforced by an Israeli court. It also may be difficult for you to effect service of process on such persons in the United States or to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of U.S. securities laws on the grounds that Israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses, which can be a time consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure would also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel that addresses the matters described above. As a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against us in Israel, you may not be able to collect any damages awarded by either a U.S. or foreign court.\nWe may become subject to claims for payment of compensation for assigned service inventions by our current or former employees, which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business.\nUnder the Israeli Patents Law, 5727-1967, or the Patents Law, inventions conceived by an employee during the scope of his or her employment are regarded as \u201cservice inventions\u201d and are owned by the employer, absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights. The Patents Law also provides that if no such agreement between an employer and an employee exists, which prescribes whether, to what extent, and on what conditions the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her service inventions, then such matters may, upon application by the employee, be decided by a government-appointed compensation and royalties committee established under the Patents Law. A significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in Israel in the course of their employment. Such employees have agreed to waive and assign to us all rights to any intellectual property created in the scope of their employment with us, and most of our current employees, including all those involved in the development of our intellectual property, have agreed to waive economic rights they may have with respect to service inventions.\nHowever, despite such contractual obligations, we cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us by current or former employees demanding remuneration in consideration for assigned alleged service inventions or any other intellectual property rights. If any such claims were filed, we could potentially be required to pay remuneration to our current or former employees for such assigned service inventions or any other intellectual property rights, or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect our business.", "PERMNO": 17325, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "MOTS"}
