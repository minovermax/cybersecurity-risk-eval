RISK FACTORS.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors we have identified below. Any of the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance.\nOur industry is subject to intense competitive pressures.\nWe operate in markets that are highly competitive. We compete on the basis of price, quality, service, and / or brand name across the industries and markets we serve. Competitive pressures could affect the prices we are able to charge our customers or the demand for our products.\nWe may not always be able to compete on price, particularly when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures. Some of our competitors have substantially greater sales, financial and manufacturing resources and may have greater access to capital than Littelfuse. As other companies enter our markets or develop new products, competition may further intensify. Our failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to our customers\u2019 needs.\nThe end markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development, and commercialization expenses on capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products may change and are difficult to estimate.\nOur future success will depend upon our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to our customers\u2019 needs. We will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated requirements of our customers. We invest heavily in research and development without knowing that we will recover these costs. Our competitors may develop products or technologies that will render our products non-competitive or obsolete. If we cannot develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business may be interrupted by labor disputes or other interruptions of supplies.\nA work stoppage could occur at certain of our facilities, most likely as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements. In addition, we may experience a shortage of supplies for various reasons, such as financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters or production difficulties that may affect one of our suppliers. A significant work stoppage, or an interruption or shortage of supplies for any reason, if protracted, could substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The transfer of our manufacturing operations and changes in our distribution model could disrupt operations for a limited time.\nOur revenues may vary significantly from period to period.\nOur revenues may vary significantly from one accounting period to another due to a variety of factors including:\n\u25cf\nchanges in our customers\u2019 buying decisions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in demand for our products;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our distributor inventory stocking;\n\u25cf\nour product mix;\n\u25cf\nour effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf\ncosts and timing of our component purchases;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our inventory control;\n\u25cf\nthe degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity;\n\u25cf\nour ability to meet delivery schedules;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nlocal conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as labor conditions and political instability; and\n\u25cf\nseasonality of certain product lines.\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could adversely affect us.\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could result in lower sales revenue and cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major U.S. auto manufacturer or significant supplier likely could lead to substantial disruptions in the automotive supply base, resulting in lower demand for our products, which likely would cause a decrease in sales revenue and have a substantial adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to manage currency or commodity price fluctuations or supply shortages is limited.\nAs a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, we are exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We have multiple sources of supply for the majority of our commodity requirements. However, significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price increases could affect prices we charge our customers, our product costs, and the competitive position of our products and services. We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on our results. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted. In addition, because of intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs, we may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable. Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, significant portions of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. The impact of possible currency devaluation in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact our results and financial guidance. For additional discussion of interest rate, currency or commodity price risk, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks.\nA significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the Company's revenue and earnings.\nAlthough the company's financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, the majority of the company\u2019s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries. The company\u2019s most significant net long exposure is to the euro. The company\u2019s most significant net short exposures are to the Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, and Philippine peso. Changes in foreign exchange rates and in particular, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to political, economic, and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.\nWe have significant operating activities in numerous countries around the globe that contribute significantly to our revenues and earnings. Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global marketplace requires the company to place our production in countries outside the U.S., including emerging markets, to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost-efficient structure. In addition, we source a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third-party suppliers in low-cost countries. Our operating activities are subject to a number of risks generally associated with multi-national operations, including risks relating to the following:\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u25cf\ncurrency fluctuations and exchange restrictions;\n\u25cf\nimport and export duties and restrictions;\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of tariffs and other import or export barriers;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with regulations governing import and export activities;\n\u25cf\ncurrent and changing regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u25cf\npotentially adverse income tax consequences;\n\u25cf\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u25cf\nlabor unrest;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters;\n\u25cf\nterrorist activities;\n\u25cf\npublic health concerns;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; and\n\u25cf\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe engage in strategic acquisitions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions and / or may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses.\nWe are a company that seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions. We have in the past acquired a number of businesses or companies and additional product lines and assets. We intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional future acquisitions.\nAn acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable. This could cause our financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. The success of these transactions also depends on our ability to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in these acquisitions. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that we anticipated from an acquisition.\nWe may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nReorganization activities may lead to additional costs and material adverse effects.\nIn the past we have taken actions to restructure and optimize our production and manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies through relocations, consolidations, plant closings or asset sales. In the future we may take additional restructuring actions including the consolidating, closing or selling of additional facilities. These actions could result in impairment charges and various charges for such items as idle capacity, disposition costs and severance costs, in addition to normal or attendant risks and uncertainties. We may be unsuccessful in any of our current or future efforts to restructure or consolidate our business. Our plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during restructuring or consolidation may not be achieved. These activities may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEnvironmental liabilities could adversely impact our financial position.\nForeign, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes or in our finished goods. These environmental regulations have required us to expend a portion of our resources and capital on relevant compliance programs. Under these laws and regulations, we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our current or former properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if we did not cause the contamination. We may be subject to additional common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties. In addition, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs. Any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the conduct of our manufacturing operations, we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state, and local laws. The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated. In addition, we operate or own facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others. Certain of these properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials. Contaminants may migrate from, within or through these properties. These releases or migrations may give rise to claims. Where third parties are responsible for contamination, the third parties may not have funds, or not make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed upon us under environmental laws and regulations.\nThe company is responsible for the maintenance of discontinued coal mining operations in Germany. The risk of environmental remediation exists and the company is in the process of remediating the mines considered to be the most at risk.\nDisruptions in our manufacturing, supply or distribution chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nWe source materials and sell product through various international network channels. A disruption could occur within our manufacturing, distribution or supply chain network. This could include damage or destruction due to various causes including natural disasters or political instability which would cause one or more of these network channels to become non-operational. This could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or deliver our products in a timely manner, impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to our reputation. Such a disruption could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive industry and we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting this industry including industry cyclicality, and unexpected product recalls as well as the success of our customers\u2019 products.\nNet sales to the automotive industry represent a substantial portion of our revenues. Factors negatively affecting this industry and the demand for products also negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse occurrence, including industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, tax policies and regulations, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers\u2019 production schedules, unexpected product recalls or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. To the extent that demand for certain of our customers\u2019 products declines, the demand for our products may decline. Reduced demand relating to general economic conditions, consumer preferences, or interest rates may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions, and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. If we are unable to access the capital markets or bank credit facilities, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFixed costs may reduce operating results if our sales fall below expectations.\nOur expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations for future sales. Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed. We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales. Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe volatility of our stock price could affect the value of an investment in our stock and our future financial position.\nThe market price of our stock can fluctuate widely. Between January 2, 2016 and December 31, 2016, the closing sale price of our common stock ranged between a low of $90.61 and a high of $156.54. The volatility of our stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as volatility in the financial markets, general macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, analysts\u2019 expectations concerning our results of operations, or the volatility of our revenues as discussed above under \u201cOur Revenues May Vary Significantly from Period to Period.\u201d The historic market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices. We may not be able to sustain or increase the value of our common stock. Declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to retain personnel with stock incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future financing activities with or involving our common stock.\nCustomer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires disclosure of use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals. In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d metals, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are \u201cconflict free.\u201d\nWe are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security.\nWe rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with many of our business activities. Some of these networks and systems are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees, and other sensitive matters. As with most companies, we have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems, and other similar incidents, none of which have been material. Any future cyber incidents could, however, materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees; and jeopardize the security of our facilities. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption, and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware, and other cyber-attacks are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nLapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability or reputation.\nWe are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Nevertheless, lapses or deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures or in our internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time.\nThere can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not exist. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties, judgments or losses not covered by insurance, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nThe company\u2019s effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors, including U.S. and/or international tax legislation, mix of the company\u2019s earnings by jurisdiction, and U.S. and foreign jurisdictional tax audits.\nThe company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Therefore, it is subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions and such changes could have a material adverse affect on the company\u2019s effective tax rate and cash flows. As a U.S. company with significant non-U.S. operations (generally taxed at rates that are lower than the U.S. statutory rate), it is particularly susceptible to changes in U.S. tax rules. Various U.S. corporate tax legislative proposals are under consideration, some of which may have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s effective tax rate and cash flows. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions are considering tax legislation based upon recommendations made by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in connection with its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting study. The outcome of these legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s effective tax rate and cash flows.\nThe tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which the company operates vary widely. Therefore, the company\u2019s effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of its earnings by jurisdiction.\nThe company is also subject to examination of its tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. However, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations.\nFailure to attract and retain qualified personnel could affect our business results.\nOur success, both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions, depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate a highly-skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategy. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily upon engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees could hinder our ability to conduct research activities successfully and develop marketable products.\nWe may not be successful protecting our patents and trademarks.\nWe consider our intellectual property, including patents, trade names, and trademarks, to be of significant value to our business as a whole. Our products are manufactured, marketed, and sold under a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire or are allowed to lapse at various dates in the future. We develop and acquire new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and consider all of our intellectual property to be valuable. The company's policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the great majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements. Based on the broad scope of our product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, multiple losses or expirations could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 77918, "SIC": 3613, "TIC": "LFUS"}
