{"cik": "1159036", "company": "HALOZYME THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nRisks Related To Our Business\nBusiness interruptions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak or similar public health crises could cause a disruption of the development of our collaboration partners\u2019 product candidates and commercialization of approved products, impede our ability to supply bulk rHuPH20 to our partners or procure and sell Hylenex and otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business and results of operations by, among other things, disrupting the development of our collaboration partners\u2019 product candidates and commercialization of our partners\u2019 approved products, disrupting our ability to enter into new ENHANZE collaborations with potential partners in a timely manner, causing disruptions in the operations of our third party contract manufacturing organizations upon whom we rely for the production and supply of our commercial product Hylenex and the bulk rHuPH20 we supply to our partners, and causing other disruptions to our operations. For example, the outbreak of a coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic and has spread to most regions of the world including the city of San Diego, California where our main office is located.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, and to date has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions and other public health safety measures. The extent to which COVID-19 and its variants impacts our operations and/or those of our collaboration partners will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration or recurrence of the outbreak, additional or modified government actions, new information that will emerge concerning the severity and impact of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or address its impact in the short and long term, among others.\nWe have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by taking a number of actions including closing our offices in San Diego in March 2020, requesting that most of our personnel work remotely and restricting access to our facilities mostly to personnel who perform critical activities that must be completed on-site in accordance with California\u2019s initial statewide shelter-in-place order and ongoing guidances. Increased reliance on personnel working from home may have a negative impact on productivity, or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact business, by, among other things, increasing cyber security risk, impeding access to information that would be helpful to pursue our business objectives or disrupting our communications. We are continuing to monitor the situation to determine the timing for all employees to return to working from the office.\nThe business disruptions associated with a global pandemic could impact the business, product development priorities and operations of our collaboration partners, including potential delays in manufacturing their product candidates or approved products. For example, some of our collaboration partners are conducting or are planning to conduct clinical trials in geographies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The progress or completion of these clinical trials could be adversely impacted by the pandemic. Additionally, interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA, the EMA and other similar foreign regulatory agencies, or changes in regulatory priorities to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect required regulatory review, inspection, clearance and approval timelines. Disruptions such as these could result in delays in the development programs of our collaboration products or impede the commercial efforts for approved products, resulting in potential reductions or delays in our revenues from collaborator royalty or milestone payments. We do not know the extent to which our collaboration partners\u2019 development programs or product commercialization efforts will be impacted or delayed.\nWe rely on third party manufacturers to manufacture the bulk rHuPH20 that we supply to our collaboration partners for their commercial products and product candidates, as well as our commercial product Hylenex. If any such third party manufacturer is adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related consequences, including staffing shortages, production slowdowns and disruptions in delivery systems, availability of raw materials, reagents or components or if they divert resources or manufacturing capacity to accommodate the development of coronavirus treatments or vaccines, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to sell Hylenex or supply bulk rHuPH20 to our collaboration partners. Any such disruptions could result in reductions or delays in our revenues.\nThe effects of COVID-19 could worsen in countries that are already afflicted with the coronavirus which could further adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and could have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results. We do not yet know the full extent of the impact that COVID-19 may or will have on our business.\nIn addition, the trading prices for our common shares and other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of market and investor reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential consequences. As a result, access to sources of financing, should those be needed, may be more difficult and/or expensive. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of the coronavirus could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common shares.\nIf partners\u2019 product candidates do not receive and maintain regulatory approvals, or if approvals are not obtained in a timely manner, such failure or delay would substantially impair our ability to generate revenues.\nApproval from the FDA or equivalent health authorities is necessary to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and the other countries in which we anticipate doing business have similar requirements. The process for obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals is extensive, time-consuming, risky and costly, and there is no guarantee that the FDA or other regulatory bodies will approve any applications that may be filed with respect to any of our partners\u2019 product candidates, or that the timing of any such approval will be appropriate for the desired product launch schedule for a product candidate. We and our collaborators attempt to provide guidance as to the timing for the filing and acceptance of such regulatory approvals, but such filings and approvals may not occur when we or our collaborators expect, or at all. The FDA or other foreign regulatory agency may refuse or delay approval of our partners\u2019 product candidates for failure to collect sufficient clinical or animal safety data and require our collaborators to conduct additional clinical or animal safety studies which may cause lengthy delays and increased costs to our partners\u2019 development programs. Any such issues associated with rHuPH20 could have an adverse impact on future development of our partners\u2019 products which include rHuPH20, future sales of Hylenex recombinant, or our ability to maintain our existing collaborations or enter into new collaborations.\nWe and our collaborators may not be successful in obtaining approvals for any additional potential products in a timely manner, or at all. Refer to the risk factor titled \u201cOur collaboration product candidates may not receive regulatory approvals or their development may be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delayed or unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory requirements or safety concerns\u201d for additional information relating to the approval of product candidates.\nAdditionally, even with respect to products which have been approved for commercialization, in order to continue to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products, we or our collaborators must maintain our regulatory approvals. If we or any of our collaborators are unsuccessful in maintaining our regulatory approvals, our ability to generate revenues would be adversely affected.\nUse of Hylenex and the products and product candidates of our partners\u2019 could be associated with side effects or adverse events.\nAs with most pharmaceutical products, use of Hylenex and the products and product candidates of our collaborators could be associated with side effects or adverse events which can vary in severity (from minor reactions to death) and frequency (infrequent or prevalent). Side effects or adverse events associated with the use of Hylenex and the products or product candidates of our collaborators may be observed at any time, including in clinical trials or when a product is commercialized, and any such side effects or adverse events may negatively affect our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or market such products and product candidates. Side effects such as toxicity or other safety issues associated with the use of Hylenex and the products and product candidates of our collaborators could require us or our collaborators to perform additional studies or halt development or commercialization of these products and product candidates or expose us to product liability lawsuits which will harm our business. For example, we experienced a clinical hold on patient enrollment and dosing in our phase 2 study of PEGPH20 in patients with PDA (a discontinued program), which was not resolved until we implemented steps to address an observed possible difference in TE event rates between the arms of the study. We or our collaborators may be required by regulatory agencies to conduct additional animal or human studies regarding the safety and efficacy of our pharmaceutical products or product candidates which we have not planned or anticipated. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we or our collaborators will resolve any issues related to any product or product candidate side effects or adverse events to the satisfaction of the FDA or any regulatory agency in a timely manner or ever, which could harm our business, prospects and financial condition.\nIf our contract manufacturers or vendors are unable to manufacture and supply to us bulk rHuPH20 or other raw materials, reagents or components in the quantity and quality required by us or our collaborators for use in the production of Hylenex or our partners\u2019 products and product candidates, our Hylenex commercialization efforts or our partners\u2019 product development and commercialization efforts could be delayed or stopped and our business results of operations and our collaborations could be harmed.\nWe have existing supply agreements with contract manufacturing organizations Avid Bioservices, Inc. (Avid) and Catalent Indiana LLC (Catalent) to produce bulk rHuPH20. These manufacturers each produce bulk rHuPH20 under cGMP for use in Hylenex recombinant, and for use in collaboration products and product candidates. We rely on their ability to successfully manufacture bulk rHuPH20 according to product specifications. In addition to supply obligations, our contract manufacturers will also provide support for the chemistry, manufacturing and controls sections for FDA and other regulatory filings. We also rely on vendors to supply us with raw materials to produce reagents and other materials for bioanalytical assays used to support our partners\u2019 clinical trials. We also have a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Patheon under which Patheon provides the final fill and finishing steps in the production process of Hylenex recombinant. If any of our contract manufacturers or vendors: (i) is unable to retain its status as an FDA approved manufacturing facility; (ii) is unable to otherwise successfully scale up bulk rHuPH20 production to meet corporate or regulatory authority quality standards; (iii) is unable to procure raw materials, reagents or components necessary to produce bulk rHuPH20, Hylenex recombinant or our\nbioanalytical assays or (iv) fails to manufacture and supply bulk rHuPH20 in the quantity and quality required by us or our collaborators for use in Hylenex and collaboration products and product candidates for any other reason, our business will be adversely affected. In addition, a significant change in such parties\u2019 or other third party manufacturers\u2019 business or financial condition could adversely affect their abilities to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. We have not established, and may not be able to establish, favorable arrangements with additional bulk rHuPH20 manufacturers and suppliers of the ingredients necessary to manufacture bulk rHuPH20 should the existing manufacturers and suppliers become unavailable or in the event that our existing manufacturers and suppliers are unable to adequately perform their responsibilities. We have attempted to mitigate the impact of a potential supply interruption through the establishment of excess bulk rHuPH20 inventory where possible, but there can be no assurances that this safety stock will be maintained or that it will be sufficient to address any delays, interruptions or other problems experienced by any of our contract manufacturers. Any delays, interruptions or other problems regarding the ability of our contract manufacturers to supply bulk rHuPH20 or the ability of other third party manufacturers, to supply other raw materials or ingredients necessary to produce our products on a timely basis could: (i) cause the delay of our partners\u2019 clinical trials or otherwise delay or prevent the regulatory approval of our partners\u2019 product candidates; (ii) delay or prevent the effective commercialization of Hylenex or collaboration products and product candidates; and/or (iii) cause us to breach contractual obligations to deliver bulk rHuPH20 to our collaborators. Such delays would likely damage our relationship with our collaborators, and they would have a material adverse effect on royalties and thus our business and financial condition. Additionally, we rely on third parties to manufacture, prepare, fill, finish, package, store and ship our product and partners\u2019 product candidates on our behalf. If the third parties we identify fail to perform their obligations, the progress of partners\u2019 clinical trials could be delayed or even suspended and the commercialization of our product and partner products could be delayed or prevented.\nIf we or any party to a key collaboration agreement fail to perform material obligations under such agreement, or if a key collaboration agreement, is terminated for any reason, our business could significantly suffer.\nWe have entered into multiple collaboration agreements under which we may receive significant future payments in the form of milestone payments, target designation fees, maintenance fees and royalties. We are heavily dependent on our collaborators to develop and commercialize product candidates subject to our collaborations in order for us to realize any financial benefits, including revenues from milestones, royalties and product sales from these collaborations. Our collaborators may not devote the attention and resources to such efforts that we would ourselves, change their clinical development plans, promotional efforts or simultaneously develop and commercialize products in competition to those products we have licensed to them. Any of these actions could not be visible to us immediately and could negatively impact our ability to forecast and our ability to achieve the benefits and revenue we receive from such collaboration. In addition, in the event that a party fails to perform under a key collaboration agreement, or if a key collaboration agreement is terminated, the reduction in anticipated revenues could negatively impact our operations. In addition, the termination of a key collaboration agreement by one or more of our collaborators could have a material adverse impact on our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements with new collaborators on favorable terms, if at all. In certain circumstances, the termination of a key collaboration agreement would require us to revise our corporate strategy going forward and reevaluate the applications and value of our technology.\nHylenex and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates rely on the rHuPH20 enzyme, and any adverse development regarding rHuPH20 could substantially impact multiple areas of our business, including current and potential collaborations, as well as any proprietary programs.\nrHuPH20 is a key technological component of Hylenex and our ENHANZE technology and most of our collaboration products and product candidates, including the current and future products and product candidates under our ENHANZE collaborations. If there is an adverse development for rHuPH20 (e.g., an adverse regulatory determination relating to rHuPH20, if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of rHuPH20, if we are unable to obtain or maintain material proprietary rights to rHuPH20 or if we discover negative characteristics of rHuPH20), multiple areas of our business, including current and potential collaborations, as well as proprietary programs would be substantially impacted. For example, elevated anti-rHuPH20 antibody titers were detected in the registration trial for Baxalta\u2019s HYQVIA product as well as in a former collaborator\u2019s product in a Phase 2 clinical trial with rHuPH20, but have not been associated, in either case, with any adverse events. We monitor for antibodies to rHuPH20 in our collaboration and proprietary programs, and although we do not believe at this time that the incidence of non-neutralizing anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in either the HYQVIA program or the former collaborator\u2019s program will have a significant impact on our proprietary product and our partners\u2019 product and product candidates, there can be no assurance that there will not be other such occurrences in the foregoing programs or that concerns regarding these antibodies will not also be raised by the FDA or other health authorities in the future, which could result in delays or discontinuations of our Hylenex commercialization activities, the development or commercialization activities of our partners, or deter our entry into additional collaborations with third parties.\nOur business strategy and our strategic focus is currently limited to only a few fields or applications of our technology which may increase the risk for potential negative impact from adverse developments. Future expansion of our strategic focus to additional applications of our technology may require the use of additional resources, result in increased expense and ultimately may not be successful.\nWe routinely evaluate our business strategy, and may modify this strategy in the future in light of our assessment of unmet medical needs, growth potential, resource requirements, regulatory issues, competition, risks and other factors. As a result of these strategic evaluations, we may focus our resources and efforts on one or a few programs or fields and may suspend or reduce our efforts on other programs and fields. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we decided to focus our resources on our ENHANZE technology and our commercial product, Hylenex. By focusing on these areas, we increase the potential impact on us if one of those partner programs does not successfully complete clinical trials, achieve commercial acceptance or meet expectations regarding sales and revenue. We may also expand our strategic focus by seeking new therapeutics applications of our technology which may require the use of additional resources, increased expense and would require the attention of senior management. There can be no assurance that any such investment of resources would ultimately result in additional approved collaboration products or commercial success of new therapeutic applications of our technology.\nOur collaboration product candidates may not receive regulatory approvals or their development may be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delayed or unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory requirements or safety concerns.\nClinical testing of pharmaceutical products is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and the failure or delay of a clinical trial can occur at any stage, including the patient enrollment stage. Even if initial results of preclinical and nonclinical studies or clinical trial results are promising, our collaborators may obtain different results in subsequent trials or studies that fail to show the desired levels of dose safety and efficacy, or our collaborators may not, obtain applicable regulatory approval for a variety of other reasons. Preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical trials for collaboration product candidates could be unsuccessful, which would delay or preclude regulatory approval and commercialization of the product candidates. In the U.S. and other jurisdictions, regulatory approval can be delayed, limited or not granted for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022during the course of clinical studies, the final data may differ from initial reported data, and clinical results may not meet prescribed endpoints for the studies or otherwise provide sufficient data to support the efficacy of our collaborators\u2019 product candidates;\n\u2022clinical and nonclinical test results may reveal inferior pharmacokinetics, side effects, adverse events or unexpected safety issues associated with the use of our collaborators\u2019 product candidates;\n\u2022regulatory review may not find that the data from preclinical testing and clinical trials justifies approval;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require that our partners change their studies or conduct additional studies which may significantly delay or make continued pursuit of approval commercially unattractive;\n\u2022a regulatory agency may reject partner trial data or disagree with their interpretations of either clinical trial data or applicable regulations;\n\u2022a regulatory agency may require additional safety monitoring and reporting through Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or conditions to assure safe use programs;\n\u2022a partner may decide to not pursue regulatory approval for such a product;\n\u2022a regulatory agency may not approve our manufacturing processes or facilities, or the processes or facilities of our collaborators, our contract manufacturers or our raw material suppliers;\n\u2022a regulatory agency may identify problems or other deficiencies in our existing manufacturing processes or facilities, or the existing processes or facilities of our collaborators, our contract manufacturers or our raw material suppliers;\n\u2022a regulatory agency may change its formal or informal approval requirements and policies, act contrary to previous guidance, adopt new regulations or raise new issues or concerns late in the approval process; or\n\u2022a partner product candidate may be approved only for indications that are narrow or under conditions that place the product at a competitive disadvantage, which may limit the sales and marketing activities for such product candidate or otherwise adversely impact the commercial potential of a product.\nIf a collaboration product candidate is not approved in a timely fashion or obtained on commercially viable terms, or if development of any product candidate is terminated due to difficulties or delays encountered in the regulatory approval process, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, and we would become more dependent on the development of other collaboration product candidates and/or our ability to successfully acquire other technologies. There can be no assurances that any collaboration product candidate will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner, or at all. There can be no assurance that partners will be able to gain clarity as to the FDA\u2019s requirements or that the requirements may be satisfied in a commercially feasible way, in which case our ability to enter into collaborations with third parties or explore other strategic alternatives to exploit an opportunity will be limited or may not be possible.\nWe anticipate that certain collaboration products will be marketed, and perhaps manufactured, in foreign countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals in foreign countries is subject to delay and failure for the reasons set forth above, as well as for reasons that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The approval process varies among countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Foreign regulatory agencies may not provide approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA.\nOur third party collaborators are responsible for providing certain proprietary materials that are essential components of our collaboration products and product candidates, and any failure to supply these materials could delay the development and commercialization efforts for these collaboration products and product candidates and/or damage our collaborations.\nOur development and commercialization collaborators are responsible for providing certain proprietary materials that are essential components of our collaboration products and product candidates. For example, Roche is responsible for producing the Herceptin and MabThera required for its subcutaneous products and Baxalta is responsible for producing the GAMMAGARD LIQUID for its product HYQVIA. If a collaborator, or any applicable third party service provider of a collaborator, encounters difficulties in the manufacture, storage, delivery, fill, finish or packaging of the collaboration product or product candidate or component of such product or product candidate, such difficulties could (i) cause the delay of clinical trials or otherwise delay or prevent the regulatory approval of collaboration product candidates; and/or (ii) delay or prevent the effective commercialization of collaboration products. Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf we or our collaborators fail to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to promotion, sale and manufacturing of approved products, regulatory agencies may take action against us or them, which could significantly harm our business.\nAny approved products, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for these products, are subject to continual requirements and review by the FDA, state and foreign regulatory bodies. Regulatory authorities subject a marketed product, its manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities to continual review and periodic inspections. We, our collaborators and our respective contractors, suppliers and vendors, will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, including complying with regulations and laws regarding advertising, promotion and sales of drug products, required submissions of safety and other post-market information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP regulations (including requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation), and the requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping requirements. Regulatory agencies may change existing requirements or adopt new requirements or policies. We, our collaborators and our respective contractors, suppliers and vendors, may be slow to adapt or may not be able to adapt to these changes or new requirements.\nIn particular, regulatory requirements applicable to pharmaceutical products make the substitution of suppliers and manufacturers costly and time consuming. We have minimal internal manufacturing capabilities and are, and expect to be in the future, entirely dependent on contract manufacturers and suppliers for the manufacture of our products and for their active and other ingredients. The disqualification of these manufacturers and suppliers through their failure to comply with regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business because the delays and costs in obtaining and qualifying alternate suppliers (if such alternative suppliers are available, which we cannot assure) could delay our partners\u2019 clinical trials or otherwise inhibit our or partners\u2019 ability to bring approved products to market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Likewise, if we, our collaborators and our respective contractors, suppliers and vendors involved in sales and promotion of our products do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example off-label or false or misleading promotion, this could materially harm our business and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in any of the following:\n\u2022restrictions on our or our partners\u2019 products or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022warning letters;\n\u2022withdrawal of our or our partners\u2019 products from the market;\n\u2022voluntary or mandatory recall;\n\u2022fines;\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022suspension or termination of any of our partners\u2019 ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal to permit the import or export of our or our partners\u2019 products;\n\u2022refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022product seizure;\n\u2022injunctions; or\n\u2022imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such funds.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund our operations and for general corporate purposes if revenues do not occur as expected. Our current cash reserves and expected revenues may not be sufficient for us to fund general operations and conduct our business at the level desired. In addition, if we engage in acquisitions of companies, products or technologies in order to execute our business strategy, we may need to raise additional capital. We may raise additional capital in the future through one or more financing vehicles that may be available to us including (i) new collaborative agreements; (ii) expansions or revisions to existing collaborative relationships; (iii) private financings; (iv) other equity or debt financings; (v) monetizing assets; and/or (vi) the public offering of securities.\nIf we are required to raise additional capital in the future, it may not be available on favorable financing terms within the time required, or at all. If additional capital is not available on favorable terms when needed, we will be required to raise capital on adverse terms or significantly reduce operating expenses through the restructuring of our operations or deferral of strategic business initiatives. If we raise additional capital through a public offering of securities or equity, a substantial number of additional shares may be issued, which may negatively affect our stock price and these additional shares will dilute the ownership interest of our current investors.\nWe currently have significant debt and may incur additional debt. Failure by us to fulfill our obligations under the applicable debt agreements may cause the repayment obligations to accelerate.\nThe aggregate amount of our consolidated indebtedness, net of debt discount, as of December 31, 2021 was $876.7 million, which includes $90.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Convertible Notes and $805.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Convertible Notes, net of unamortized debt discount of $1.5 million and of $17.7 million, respectively. We also may incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nOur indebtedness may:\n\u2022make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases or other general business purposes;\n\u2022require us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to make payments on our existing or any future debt will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate cash and may also depend on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing. It will also depend on financial, business or other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. We will need to use cash to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to fund operations, strategic initiatives and working capital requirements. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations, an event of default may occur under any of our debt instruments which could result in an acceleration of such debt upon which we may be required to repay all the amounts outstanding under some or all of our debt instruments. Such an acceleration of our debt obligations could harm our financial condition. From time to time, we may seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases or exchanges would be on such terms and at such prices as we determine, and will depend on current market conditions, our liquidity needs, any restrictions in our contracts and other factors. The amounts involved in such transactions could be material.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Even if holders of the Convertible Notes do not elect to convert their notes, we are required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability\nwhen the conditional conversion feature is triggered, which results in a material reduction of our net working capital. For example, as of December 31, 2021, the conditional conversion feature was triggered and our 2024 Convertible Notes are classified as a current liability.\nConversion of our Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of our Convertible Notes, to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion, will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the Convertible Notes or our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nIf collaboration product candidates are approved for marketing but do not gain market acceptance resulting in commercial performance below that which was expected or projected, our business may suffer and we may not be able to fund future operations.\nAssuming that existing or future collaboration product candidates obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for commercial sale, a number of factors may affect the market acceptance of these newly-approved products, including, among others:\n\u2022the degree to which the use of these products is restricted by the approved product label;\n\u2022the price of these products relative to other therapies for the same or similar treatments;\n\u2022the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third party payors including government insurance programs and private insurers;\n\u2022the introduction of generic or biosimilar competitors to these products;\n\u2022the perception by patients, physicians and other members of the health care community of the effectiveness and safety of these products for their prescribed treatments relative to other therapies for the same or similar treatments;\n\u2022the ability and willingness of our collaborators to fund sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u2022the effectiveness of the sales and marketing efforts of our collaborators.\nIf these collaboration products do not gain or maintain market acceptance or experience reduced sales resulting in commercial performance below that which was expected or projected, the royalties we expect to receive from these products will be diminished which could harm our ability to fund future operations, including conduct acquisitions, execute our planned share repurchases, or affect our ability to use funds for other general corporate purposes and cause our business to suffer.\nIn addition, our partners\u2019 product candidates will be restricted to the labels approved by FDA and applicable regulatory bodies, and these restrictions may limit the marketing and promotion of the ultimate products. If the approved labels are restrictive, the sales and marketing efforts for these collaboration products may be negatively affected.\nOur ability to license our ENHANZE technology to our collaboration partners depends on the validity of our patents and other proprietary rights.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our inventions, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We have multiple patents and patent applications throughout the world pertaining to our recombinant human hyaluronidase and methods of use and manufacture, including an issued U.S. patent which expires in 2027 and an issued European patent which expires in 2024, which we believe cover the products and product candidates under our existing collaborations, and Hylenex. Although we believe our patent filings represent a barrier to entry for potential competitors looking to utilize these hyaluronidases, upon expiration of our patents other pharmaceutical companies may (if they do not infringe our other patents) seek to compete with us by developing, manufacturing and selling biosimilars to the active drug ingredient in our ENHANZE technology used by our collaboration partners in combination with their products. Any such loss of patent protection or proprietary rights could lead to a reduction or loss of revenues, incentivize one or more of our key ENHANZE collaboration partners to terminate their relationship with us and impact our ability to enter into new collaboration and license agreements.\nDeveloping and marketing pharmaceutical products for human use involves significant product liability risks for which we currently have limited insurance coverage.\nThe testing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products involves the risk of product liability claims by consumers and other third parties. Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, product liability claims can be high in the pharmaceutical industry, and our insurance may not sufficiently cover our actual liabilities. If product liability claims were to be\nmade against us, it is possible that the liabilities may exceed the limits of our insurance policy, or our insurance carriers may deny, or attempt to deny, coverage in certain instances. If a lawsuit against us is successful, then the insurance coverage may not be sufficient and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. Furthermore, various distributors of pharmaceutical products require minimum product liability insurance coverage before purchase or acceptance of products for distribution. Failure to satisfy these insurance requirements could impede our ability to achieve broad distribution of our proposed products, and higher insurance requirements could impose additional costs on us. In addition, since many of our collaboration product candidates include the pharmaceutical products of a third party, we run the risk that problems with the third party pharmaceutical product will give rise to liability claims against us.\nIf our collaborators do not achieve projected development, clinical, or regulatory goals in the timeframes publicly announced or otherwise expected, the commercialization of our collaboration products may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline, and we may face lawsuits relating to such declines.\nFrom time to time, our collaborators may publicly articulate the estimated timing for the accomplishment of certain scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals. The accomplishment of any goal is typically based on numerous assumptions, and the achievement of a particular goal may be delayed for any number of reasons both within and outside of our and our collaborators\u2019 control. If scientific, regulatory, strategic or other factors cause a collaboration partner to not meet a goal, regardless of whether that goal has been publicly articulated or not, our stock price may decline rapidly. Stock price declines may also trigger direct or derivative shareholder lawsuits. As with any litigation proceeding, the eventual outcome of any legal action is difficult to predict. If any such lawsuits occur, we will incur expenses in connection with the defense of these lawsuits, and we may have to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in connection with any resolution thereof. Although we have insurance coverage against which we may claim recovery against some of these expenses and costs, the amount of coverage may not be adequate to cover the full amount or certain expenses and costs may be outside the scope of the policies we maintain. In the event of an adverse outcome or outcomes, our business could be materially harmed from depletion of cash resources, negative impact on our reputation, or restrictions or changes to our governance or other processes that may result from any final disposition of the lawsuit. Moreover, responding to and defending pending litigation significantly diverts management\u2019s attention from our operations.\nIn addition, the consistent failure to meet publicly announced milestones may erode the credibility of our management team with respect to future milestone estimates.\nFuture acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nIn order to augment our product pipeline or otherwise strengthen our business, we may decide to acquire additional businesses, products and technologies. As we have limited experience in evaluating and completing acquisitions, our ability as an organization to make such acquisitions is unproven. Acquisitions could require significant capital infusions and could involve many risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022we may have to issue additional convertible debt or equity securities to complete an acquisition, which would dilute our stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock;\n\u2022an acquisition may negatively impact our results of operations because it may require us to amortize or write down amounts related to goodwill and other intangible assets, or incur or assume substantial debt or liabilities, or it may cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;\n\u2022we may encounter difficulties in assimilating and integrating the business, products, technologies, personnel or operations of companies that we acquire;\n\u2022certain acquisitions may impact our relationship with existing or potential collaborators who are competitive with the acquired business, products or technologies;\n\u2022acquisitions may require significant capital infusions and the acquired businesses, products or technologies may not generate sufficient value to justify acquisition costs;\n\u2022we may take on liabilities from the acquired company such as debt, legal liabilities or business risk which could be significant;\n\u2022an acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses and distract our management;\n\u2022acquisitions may involve the entry into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience; and\n\u2022key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us.\nIf any of these risks occurred, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. There is no assurance that we will be able to identify or consummate any future acquisitions on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do pursue any acquisitions, it is possible that we may not realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions or that the market will not view such acquisitions positively.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nOur effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. Nevertheless, our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability between different tax jurisdictions, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations and may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\nIn addition, on September 30, 2021, we determined, based on our facts and circumstances, that it was more likely than not that a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets would be realized and, as a result, substantially all of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was released. This resulted in substantially and disproportionately increasing our reported net income and our earnings per share compared to our operating results for 2021. Historical and future comparisons to these amounts are not, and will not be, indicative of actual profitability trends for our business. Beginning in 2022, we expect to commence recording income tax expense at an estimated tax rate that will likely approximate statutory tax rates, which would result in a significant reduction in our net income and net income per share.\nRisks Related To Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is subject to significant volatility.\nWe participate in a highly dynamic industry which often results in significant volatility in the market price of common stock irrespective of company performance. The high and low sales prices of our common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 were $56.40 and $31.79, respectively. In addition to the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and all other risks and uncertainties that are either not known to us at this time or which we deem to be immaterial, any of the following factors may lead to a significant drop in our stock price:\n\u2022the presence of competitive products to those being developed by our partners;\n\u2022failure (actual or perceived) of our collaborators to devote attention or resources to the development or commercialization of products or product candidates licensed to such collaborator;\n\u2022a dispute regarding our failure, or the failure of one of our third party collaborators, to comply with the terms of a collaboration agreement;\n\u2022the termination, for any reason, of any of our collaboration agreements;\n\u2022the sale of common stock by any significant stockholder, including, but not limited to, direct or indirect sales by members of management or our Board of Directors;\n\u2022the resignation, or other departure, of members of management or our Board of Directors;\n\u2022general negative conditions in the healthcare industry;\n\u2022pandemics or other global crises;\n\u2022general negative conditions in the financial markets;\n\u2022the cost associated with obtaining regulatory approval for any of our collaboration product candidates;\n\u2022the failure, for any reason, to secure or defend our intellectual property position;\n\u2022the failure or delay of applicable regulatory bodies to approve our partners\u2019 product candidates;\n\u2022identification of safety or tolerability issues;\n\u2022failure of our partners\u2019 clinical trials to meet efficacy endpoints;\n\u2022suspensions or delays in the conduct of our partners\u2019 clinical trials or securing of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022adverse regulatory action with respect to our and our collaborators\u2019 products and product candidates such as loss of regulatory approval to commercialize such products, clinical holds, imposition of onerous requirements for approval or product recalls;\n\u2022our failure, or the failure of our third party collaborators, to successfully commercialize products approved by applicable regulatory bodies such as the FDA;\n\u2022our failure, or the failure of our third party collaborators, to generate product revenues anticipated by investors;\n\u2022disruptions in our clinical or commercial supply chains, including disruptions caused by problems with a bulk rHuPH20 contract manufacturer or a fill and finish manufacturer for any product or product collaboration candidate;\n\u2022the sale of additional debt and/or equity securities by us;\n\u2022our failure to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u2022a restructuring of our operations;\n\u2022an inability to execute our share repurchase program in the time and manner we expect due to market, business, legal or other considerations; or\n\u2022a conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock.\nFuture transactions where we raise capital may negatively affect our stock price.\nWe are currently a \u201cWell-Known Seasoned Issuer\u201d and may file automatic shelf registration statements at any time with the SEC. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or other securities under our current or future shelf registration statements could lower the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, the Indentures and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, the Indentures and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. First, our Board of Directors is classified into three classes of directors. Under Delaware law, directors of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause unless the corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, does not provide otherwise. In addition, our bylaws limit who may call special meetings of stockholders, permitting only stockholders holding at least 50% of our outstanding shares to call a special meeting of stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not include a provision for cumulative voting for directors. Under cumulative voting, a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors. Finally, our bylaws establish procedures, including advance notice procedures, with regard to the nomination of candidates for election as directors and stockholder proposals.\nThese provisions in our charter documents may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors.\nFurther, in connection with our Convertible Notes issuances, we entered into an indenture, dated as of November 18, 2019, and an indenture dated as of March 1, 2021 (the\u201cIndentures\u201d) with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Certain provisions in the Indenture could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a takeover would constitute a fundamental change, holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes in cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Convertible Notes in connection with such takeover. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Convertible Notes and the Indentures could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us.\nThese provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur partners\u2019 products must receive regulatory approval before they can be sold, and compliance with the extensive government regulations is expensive and time consuming and may result in the delay or cancellation of collaboration product sales, introductions or modifications.\nExtensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business. All pharmaceutical companies, including ours, are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulation by the health regulatory agencies including the FDA (and with respect to controlled drug substances, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)) and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies and state and local/regional government agencies. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other domestic and foreign statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, recordkeeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our product and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental approvals, including regulatory approvals in jurisdictions outside the United States, prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping our products. Consequently, there is always a risk that the FDA or other applicable governmental authorities, including those outside the United States, will not approve our partners\u2019 products or may impose onerous, costly and time-consuming requirements such as additional clinical or animal testing. Regulatory authorities may require that our partners\u2019 change our studies or conduct additional studies, which may significantly delay or make continued pursuit of approval commercially unattractive to our partners. For example, the approval of Baxalta\u2019s HYQVIA BLA was delayed by the FDA until we and Baxalta provided additional preclinical data sufficient to address concerns regarding non-neutralizing antibodies to rHuPH20 that were detected in the registration trial. Although these antibodies have not been associated with any known adverse clinical effects, and the HYQVIA BLA was ultimately approved by the FDA, the FDA or other foreign regulatory agency may, at any time, halt our and our collaborators\u2019 development and commercialization activities due to safety concerns. In addition, even if our product or partners\u2019 products are approved, regulatory agencies may also take post-approval action limiting or revoking our or our partners\u2019 ability to sell these products. Any of these regulatory actions may adversely affect the economic benefit we may derive from our product or our partners\u2019 products and therefore harm our financial condition.\nUnder certain of these regulations, in addition to our partners, we and our contract suppliers and manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection of our or their respective facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of products by the FDA, the DEA and other authorities, which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that we and our contract suppliers and manufacturers are in compliance with all applicable regulations. The FDA also conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems, or our contract suppliers\u2019 and manufacturers\u2019 processes, are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. If our partners, we, or our contract suppliers, fail these inspections, our partners may not be able to commercialize their products in a timely manner without incurring significant additional costs, or at all.\nIn addition, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulatory requirements on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to various broad federal and state healthcare laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur business operations and activities may be directly, or indirectly, subject to various broad federal and state healthcare laws, including without limitation, anti-kickback laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), false claims laws, civil monetary penalty laws, data privacy and security laws, tracing and tracking laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including, but not limited to, research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion and other business arrangements. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with principal investigators and research subjects, as well as sales, marketing and education programs. Many states have similar healthcare fraud and abuse laws, some of which may be broader in scope and may not be limited to items or services for which payment is made by a government health care program.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. While we have adopted a healthcare corporate compliance program, it is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our operations or activities are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished\nprofits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nIn addition, any sales of products outside the U.S. will also likely subject us to the FCPA and foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nWe may be required to initiate or defend against legal proceedings related to intellectual property rights, which may result in substantial expense, delay and/or cessation of the development and commercialization of our products.\nWe primarily rely on patents to protect our intellectual property rights. The strength of this protection, however, is uncertain. For example, it is not certain that:\n\u2022we will be able to obtain patent protection for our products and technologies;\n\u2022the scope of any of our issued patents will be sufficient to provide commercially significant exclusivity for our products and technologies;\n\u2022others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies and obtain patent protection before we do; and\n\u2022any of our issued patents, or patent pending applications that result in issued patents, will be held valid, enforceable and infringed in the event the patents are asserted against others.\nWe currently own or license several patents and also have pending patent applications applicable to rHuPH20 and other proprietary materials. There can be no assurance that our existing patents, or any patents issued to us as a result of our pending patent applications, will provide a basis for commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will not face third party challenges or be the subject of further proceedings limiting their scope or enforceability. Any weaknesses or limitations in our patent portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, if any of our pending patent applications do not result in issued patents, or result in issued patents with narrow or limited claims, this could result in us having no or limited protection against generic or biosimilar competition against our product candidates which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may become involved in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or other proceedings in other jurisdictions, to determine the priority, validity or enforceability of our patents. In addition, costly litigation could be necessary to protect our patent position.\nWe also rely on trademarks to protect the names of our products (e.g. Hylenex recombinant). We may not be able to obtain trademark protection for any proposed product names we select. In addition, product names for pharmaceutical products must be approved by health regulatory authorities such as the FDA in addition to meeting the legal standards required for trademark protection and product names we propose may not be timely approved by regulatory agencies which may delay product launch. In addition, our trademarks may be challenged by others. If we enforce our trademarks against third parties, such enforcement proceedings may be expensive.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation that we seek to protect with confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and others with whom we discuss our business. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability or enforceability of these agreements, and we might not be able to resolve these disputes in our favor.\nIn addition to protecting our own intellectual property rights, third parties may assert patent, trademark or copyright infringement or other intellectual property claims against us. If we become involved in any intellectual property litigation, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including but not limited to treble damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Further, we may be stopped from developing, manufacturing or selling our products until we obtain a license from the owner of the relevant technology or other intellectual property rights. If such a license is available at all, it may require us to pay substantial royalties or other fees.\nPatent protection for protein-based therapeutic products and other biotechnology inventions is subject to a great deal of uncertainty, and if patent laws or the interpretation of patent laws change, our competitors may be able to develop and commercialize products based on our discoveries.\nPatent protection for protein-based therapeutic products is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. In recent years, there have been significant changes in patent law, including the legal standards that govern the scope of protein and biotechnology patents. Standards for patentability of full-length and partial genes, and their corresponding proteins, are changing. Recent court decisions have made it more difficult to obtain patents, by making it more difficult to satisfy the patentable subject matter requirement and the requirement of non-obviousness, have decreased the availability of injunctions against infringers, and have increased the likelihood of challenging the validity of a patent through a declaratory judgment action. Taken together, these decisions could make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain, license and enforce\nour patents. In addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (HR 1249) was signed into law in September 2011, which among other changes to the U.S. patent laws, changes patent priority from \u201cfirst to invent\u201d to \u201cfirst to file,\u201d implements a post-grant opposition system for patents and provides for a prior user defense to infringement. These judicial and legislative changes have introduced significant uncertainty in the patent law landscape and may potentially negatively impact our ability to procure, maintain and enforce patents to provide exclusivity for our products.\nThere also have been, and continue to be, policy discussions concerning the scope of patent protection awarded to biotechnology inventions. Social and political opposition to biotechnology patents may lead to narrower patent protection within the biotechnology industry. Social and political opposition to patents on genes and proteins and recent court decisions concerning patentability of isolated genes may lead to narrower patent protection, or narrower claim interpretation, for isolated genes, their corresponding proteins and inventions related to their use, formulation and manufacture. Patent protection relating to biotechnology products is also subject to a great deal of uncertainty outside the U.S., and patent laws are evolving and undergoing revision in many countries. Changes in, or different interpretations of, patent laws worldwide may result in our inability to obtain or enforce patents, and may allow others to use our discoveries to develop and commercialize competitive products, which would impair our business.\nIf third party reimbursement and customer contracts are not available, Hylenex and our partners\u2019 products may not be accepted in the market resulting in commercial performance below that which was expected or projected.\nOur ability to earn sufficient returns on Hylenex and our partners\u2019 ability to earn sufficient returns on their products will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed care organizations and other healthcare providers.\nThird-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit both the coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drug products to contain costs. Consequently, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Third party payors may not establish adequate levels of reimbursement for the products that we and our partners commercialize, which could limit their market acceptance and result in a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition.\nCustomer contracts, such as with group purchasing organizations and hospital formularies, will often not offer contract or formulary status without either the lowest price or substantial proven clinical differentiation. If, for example, Hylenex is compared to animal-derived hyaluronidases by these entities, it is possible that neither of these conditions will be met, which could limit market acceptance and result in a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition.\nThe rising cost of healthcare and related pharmaceutical product pricing has led to cost containment pressures from third-party payers as well as changes in federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices that could cause us and our partners to sell our products at lower prices, and impact access to our and our partners\u2019 products, resulting in less revenue to us.\nAny of our proprietary or collaboration products that have been, or in the future are, approved by the FDA may be purchased or reimbursed by state and federal government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations. Such third party payors increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing. The trend toward managed healthcare in the U.S., the growth of such organizations, and various legislative proposals and enactments to reform healthcare and government insurance programs, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Modernization Act of 2003 and the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), could significantly influence the manner in which pharmaceutical products are prescribed and purchased, resulting in lower prices and/or a reduction in demand. Such cost containment measures and healthcare reforms could adversely affect our ability to sell our product and our partners\u2019 ability to sell their products.\nIn the U.S., our business may be impacted by changes in federal reimbursement policy resulting from executive actions, federal regulations, or federal demonstration projects.\nThe federal administration and/or agencies, such as CMS, have announced a number of demonstration projects, recommendations and proposals to implement various elements described in the drug pricing blueprint. CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare and overseeing state Medicaid programs and Health Insurance Marketplaces, has substantial power to implement policy changes or demonstration projects that can quickly and significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. For example, in November 2020, former President Trump announced the interim final rule to implement the Most Favored Nations drug pricing model seeking to tie Medicare payment rates to an international index price. This final rule is currently subject to a preliminary injunction. Additionally, a number of Congressional committees have also held hearings and evaluated proposed legislation on drug pricing and payment policy which may affect our business. For example, in July 2019, the Senate Finance Committee advanced a bill that in part would penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers for increasing drug list prices covered by Medicare Part B and Part D, faster than the rate of inflation, and cap out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare Part D beneficiaries. Several other proposals have been introduced that, if enacted and implemented, could affect access to and sales of our and our partners\u2019 products, allow the federal\ngovernment to engage in price negotiations on certain drugs, and allow importation of prescription medication from Canada or other countries.\nIn this dynamic environment, we are unable to predict which or how many federal policy, legislative or regulatory changes may ultimately be enacted. To the extent federal government initiatives decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our or our partners\u2019 products, limit or impact our decisions regarding the pricing of biopharmaceutical products or otherwise reduce the use of our or our partners\u2019 U.S. products, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, individual states are considering proposed legislation and have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third party payors or other restrictions could negatively and materially impact our revenues and financial condition. We anticipate that we will encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries outside the U.S.\nIn addition, private payers in the US, including insurers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), integrated healthcare delivery systems, and group purchasing organizations, are continuously seeking ways to reduce drug costs. Many payers have developed and continue to develop ways to shift a greater portion of drug costs to patients through, for example, limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans and higher co-pay or coinsurance obligations. Consolidation in the payer space has also resulted in a few large PBMs and insurers which place greater pressure on pricing and utilization negotiations for our and our partners\u2019 products in the U.S., increasing the need for higher discounts and rebates and limiting patient access and utilization. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates and other price reductions, fees, coverage and plan changes, or exclusions imposed by these private payers on our and our partners\u2019 products could have an adverse event on product sales, our business and results of operations.\nWe also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.\nWe face intense competition and rapid technological change that could result in the development of products by others that are competitive with or superior to our proprietary and collaboration products, including those under development.\nOur proprietary and collaboration products have numerous competitors in the U.S. and abroad including, among others, major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions that have developed competing products. Many of these competitors have substantially more resources and product development, manufacturing and marketing experience and capabilities than we do. The competitors for Hylenex recombinant include, but are not limited to, Bausch Health Companies, Inc.\u2019s FDA-approved product, Vitrase\u00ae, an ovine (ram) hyaluronidase, and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s product, Amphadase\u00ae, a bovine (bull) hyaluronidase. For our ENHANZE technology, such competitors may include major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology firms. These competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective, safer, or less costly than our current or future proprietary and collaboration products and product candidates or that could render our and our partners\u2019 products, technologies and product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive.\nGeneral Risks\nOur inability to attract, hire and retain key management and scientific personnel could negatively affect our business.\nOur success depends on the performance of key management and scientific employees with relevant experience. We depend substantially on our ability to hire, train, motivate and retain high quality personnel, especially our scientists and management team. If we are unable to identify, hire and retain qualified personnel, our ability to support current and future alliances with strategic collaborators could be adversely impacted. Our use of domestic and international third-party contractors, consultants and staffing agencies also subjects us to potential co-employment liability claims.\nFurthermore, if we were to lose key management personnel, we may lose some portion of our institutional knowledge and technical know-how, potentially causing a disruption or delay in one or more of our partnered development programs until adequate replacement personnel could be hired and trained. In addition, we do not have key person life insurance policies on the lives of any of our employees which would help cover the cost of associated with the loss of key employees.\nOur operations might be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nOur operations, including laboratories, offices and other research facilities, are located in multiple buildings in San Diego, California. We depend on our facilities and on our collaborators, contractors and vendors for the continued operation of our business. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, pandemics, interruptions in the supply of natural resources, political and governmental changes, wildfires and other fires, floods, explosions, actions of animal rights activists, earthquakes and civil unrest could disrupt our operations or those of our collaborators, contractors and vendors. Even though we believe we carry commercially reasonable business interruption and liability insurance, and our contractors may carry liability insurance that protect us in certain events, we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our and our contractors\u2019 insurance policies or for which we or our contractors do not have coverage. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results. Moreover, any such event could delay our partners\u2019 research and development programs.\nCyberattacks, security breaches or system breakdowns may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results and reputation.\nWe and our partners are subject to increasingly sophisticated attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology storage and access systems and are devoting resources to protect against such intrusion. Cyberattacks could render us or our partners unable to utilize key systems or access important data needed to operate our business. The wrongful use, theft, deliberate sabotage or any other type of security breach with respect to any of our or any of our vendors and partners\u2019 information technology storage and access systems could result in the breakdown or other service interruption, or the disruption of our ability to use such systems or disclosure or dissemination of proprietary and confidential information that is electronically stored, including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials or personal information belonging to us, our staff, our patients, customers and/or other business partners which could result in a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We continue to invest in monitoring, and other security and data recovery measures to protect our critical and sensitive data and systems. However, these may not be adequate to prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks or breaches of our systems. In addition, our cybersecurity insurance may not be sufficient to cover us against liability related to any such breaches. Furthermore, any physical break-in or trespass of our facilities could result in the misappropriation, theft, sabotage or any other type of security breach with respect to our proprietary and confidential information, including research or clinical data or damage to our research and development equipment and assets. Such adverse effects could be material and irrevocable to our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation.", "PERMNO": 90436, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HALO"}
