{"cik": "707886", "company": "UNITED COMMUNITY FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nLike all financial companies, United Community\u2019s business and results of operations are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outside of our control. In addition to the other information in this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could materially impact our business and future results of operations.\nUnited Community and the Bank have an enterprise risk management program. The Board Risk Management Committee provides oversight of the program. The Board also adopted the Corporate Risk Management and Control Policy. The policy provides a framework for risk identification, monitoring and mitigation through a risk assessment process, including reviewing of policies and procedures to enhance the controls and risk management practices at United Community and the Bank. The Officers Risk Management Committee leads this process as part of an ongoing program.\nRisk Related to Economic, Political and Market Conditions\nEconomic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA reduction in the availability of credit, the lack of confidence in the financial sector, a decrease in consumer confidence, an increase in volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Economic turmoil in Europe and Asia and changes in oil production in the Middle East affect the economy and stock prices in the United States, which can affect United Community\u2019s earnings and capital and the ability of its customers to repay loans. In addition, the timing and circumstances of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union (Brexit) and their effects on the United States are unknown. As a result of the challenges presented by economic conditions, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u2022\nInability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, or decreases in value of real estate collateral securing the payment of such loans resulting in significant credit losses, which could result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\n\u2022\nIncreased regulation of the financial services industry, including heightened legal standards and regulatory requirements or expectations. Compliance with such regulation will likely increase costs and may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\u2022\nDisruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations, may result in an inability to borrow on favorable terms or at all from other financial institutions.\n\u2022\nIncreased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions, which may adversely affect our ability to market competitive products and services.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, inflation, recession, unemployment, the money supply and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. While we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk.\nIncreases in interest rates can affect the value of available for sale securities, loans and other assets, including our ability to realize gains on the sale of these assets. We originate loans for sale and for our portfolio. Increasing interest rates may reduce the origination of loans for sale and consequently the fee income we earn on such sales. Further, increasing interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases, resulting in an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized.\nIn contrast, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing clients to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of assets related to the servicing rights on loans sold to be lower than originally anticipated. If this happens, we may need to write down our servicing assets faster, which would accelerate our expense and lower our earnings.\nVolatility in the economy may negatively impact the fair value of our common shares.\nThe market price for our common shares has been volatile in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future, including:\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of developments related to our business;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nSales of substantial amounts of our securities into the marketplace;\n\u2022\nGeneral conditions in our markets or the worldwide economy;\n\u2022\nA default by another large financial institution;\n\u2022\nA shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to market expectations;\n\u2022\nOur inability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nOur announcement of other projects.\nA transition away from LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect our income and expenses and the value of various financial contracts.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021. It is uncertain at this time whether LIBOR will change or cease to exist or the extent to which those entering into financial contracts will transition to any other particular benchmark. Other benchmarks may perform differently than LIBOR or alternative benchmarks have performed in the past or have other consequences that cannot currently be anticipated. It is also uncertain what will happen with instruments that rely on LIBOR for future interest rate adjustments and which remain outstanding if LIBOR ceases to exist.\nAdverse changes in the financial markets may adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe capital and credit markets have been experiencing unprecedented levels of volatility since 2008. While the Company generally invests in securities with limited credit risk, certain investment securities we hold possess higher credit risk since they represent beneficial interests in structured investments collateralized by residential mortgages. Regardless of the level of credit risk, all investment securities are subject to changes in market value due to changing interest rates and implied credit spreads.\nStructured investments have at times been subject to significant market volatility due to the uncertainty of credit ratings, deterioration in credit losses occurring within certain types of residential mortgages, changes in prepayments of the underlying collateral and the lack of transparency related to the investment structures and the collateral underlying the structured investment vehicles.\nA default by another larger financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This \u201csystemic risk\u201d may adversely affect our business.\nRisk Related to Our Business\nIncreases in credit risks could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThere are inherent risks associated with our lending activities, including credit risk, which is the risk that borrowers may not repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing loans will decrease. We attempt to manage credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions and an on-going assessment of the quality of the credit already extended. However, conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply, declines in real estate value and other factors beyond our control may increase our credit risk. Such changes in the economy may have a negative impact on the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of our collateral. In addition, substantial portions of our loans are to individuals and businesses in Ohio. Consequently, any decline in the state\u2019s economy could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Home Savings will be unable to collect both the contractual interest payments and the contractual principal payments, as scheduled in the loan agreement. Construction loans generally involve greater underwriting and default risks than loans secured by mortgages on existing properties because construction loans are more difficult to appraise and to monitor. In the event a default on a construction loan occurs and foreclosure follows, we may need to take control of the project and attempt either to arrange for completion of construction or dispose of the unfinished project.\nWe operate in an extremely competitive market, and our business will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\nIn our market area, we encounter significant competition from savings and loan associations, banks, credit unions, mortgage-banking firms, securities brokerage firms, asset management firms and insurance companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do and may offer services that we do not or cannot provide. In order to compete, Home Savings may need to lower interest rates on its products to match interest rates offered by its competition, which could have a negative impact on net interest margin and earnings.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nManagement\u2019s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods in order to ensure that they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Three of the most critical estimates are the level of the allowance for loan losses, the fair value of real estate owned and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will not significantly increase the allowance for loan losses, sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance or recognize a significant provision for the impairment of mortgage servicing rights. Material additions to the allowance for loan losses and any loan losses that exceed our reserves would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business. However, every loan we make carries a risk of non-payment. This risk is affected by, among other things: cash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed; in the case of a collateralized loan, the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral; the credit history of a particular borrower; changes in economic and industry conditions; and the duration of the loan.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. One of our most critical estimates is the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will not be required to charge earnings for significant unexpected loan losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is a reasonable estimate of known and probable incurred losses within the loan portfolio. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. Through a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio, management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses by considering general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio, the collateral supporting the loans and performance of customers relative to their financial obligations with us. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates and real estate values, which may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. We cannot fully predict the amount or timing of losses or whether the loan loss allowance will be adequate in the future.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to manage growth in our effectively.\nWe may acquire other financial institutions or parts of institutions in the future, open new branches, and consider new lines of business and new products or services. Expansions of its business would involve a number of expenses and risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions or expansions into new markets;\n\u2022\nthe potential inaccuracy of estimates and judgments used to evaluate the business and risks with respect to target institutions;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of hiring local management and opening new offices;\n\u2022\nthe delay in the generation of profits from commencing potential acquisitions or engaging in new activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to finance an expansion and the possible dilution to existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention to the expansion;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s lack of familiarity with new market areas;\n\u2022\nthe integration of new products and services and new personnel into our existing business;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and effects on United Community\u2019s results of operations; and\n\u2022\nthe risk of loss of key employees and customers.\nIf our growth involves the acquisition of companies through merger or other acquisition, the success of such merger or acquisition will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine the businesses in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost efficiencies, and does not cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of United Community to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or acquisition.\nFailure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on its business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect United Community\u2019s ability to successfully implement its business strategy.\nOur results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely impacted by potential losses in connection with actual or projected repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages sold into the secondary market.\nIn connection with the origination and sale of residential mortgages into the secondary market, we makes certain representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require it to repurchase such loans, substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. Although we believe that our mortgage documentation and procedures have been appropriate, it is possible that we will receive repurchase requests in the future and we may not be able to reach favorable settlements with respect to such requests. It is therefore possible that we may increase its reserves or may sustain losses associated with such loan repurchases and indemnification payments.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people. There are a limited number of qualified persons in our market area with the knowledge and experience required to successfully manage our business. The unexpected loss of services of other key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of a loss of their skills, knowledge of our market and years of industry experience. If the Company is not able to promptly recruit qualified personnel, which the Company requires to conduct our operations, our business and our ability to successfully implement our strategic plan could be affected.\nWe rely, in part, on external financing to fund our operations and the availability of such funds in the future could adversely impact our growth strategy and prospects.\nWe rely on deposits, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings to fund our banking operations. Although we consider our sources of funds to be adequate for its current funding needs, we may seek additional debt or equity capital in the future to achieve its long-term business objectives. The sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our shareholders, and debt refinancing arrangements may require us to pledge some of our assets and enter into covenants that would restrict its ability to incur further indebtedness. Additional financing sources, if sought, might be unavailable to the Company or, if available, could be on terms unfavorable to it. If additional financing sources are unavailable, not available on reasonable terms or we are unable to obtain any required regulatory approval for additional debt, our growth strategy and future prospects could be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends is subject to certain regulatory requirements.\nUnited Community is generally dependent upon the earnings of Home Savings for funds to pay dividends on our common shares. The payment of dividends by Home Savings is subject to certain regulatory restrictions. Federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) to its parent holding company if the depository institution would be undercapitalized as a result.\nU.S. tax laws applicable to Home Savings would cause a taxable recapture of accumulated bad debt reserves of up to $21.1 million to the extent that Home Savings makes a distribution to United Community while Home Savings does not have sufficient tax earnings and profits at the time of such distribution. The income tax liability resulting from such a distribution could be as great as $4.4 million. No deferred tax liability has been recorded for this potential recapture liability. For a further description, refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, until Home Savings restores its tax earnings and profits to an amount sufficient to avoid taxable bad debt reserve recapture upon distributions to United Community, we may be unwilling to approve a dividend from Home Savings to United Community even if Home Savings was otherwise permitted or able to make a dividend to United Community. As of December 31, 2018, the deficit in tax earnings and profits was approximately $12.0 million. Tax earnings and profits is generally increased by taxable income and tax-exempt income and decreased by income taxes payable and non-deductible expenses.\nAs a result, any payment of dividends in the future by United Community will be generally dependent on Home Savings\u2019 earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors.\nChanges in the fair value of our investment securities may reduce stockholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nAs of December 31, 2018, securities available for sale were $241.6 million and the net unrealized losses on those securities were $4.8 million. Stockholders\u2019 equity is increased or decreased by the change in unrealized gain or loss on these securities, through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). The unrealized gain or loss represents the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost of the securities. A decline in the estimated fair value of the portfolio results in, but is not limited to, a decline in stockholders\u2019 equity, book value per common share, and tangible book value per common share. Potential recovery of a debt security is dependent upon a number of factors as it approaches maturity, including, but not limited to, credit quality and market interest rates. Increases in market interest rates commonly result in declines in the fair value of debt securities. Equity securities have no stated maturity; therefore, declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time and are subject to market and issuer fundamentals.\nWe conduct quarterly reviews of our securities portfolio to determine if the declines are other-than-temporary. If we determine that fair value decreases are other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings as a component of noninterest income.\nWe continue to monitor the fair value of our securities portfolio as part of our ongoing other-than-temporary-impairment (OTTI) evaluation process. No assurance can be given that we will not need to recognize OTTI charges in the future. Additional OTTI charges may materially affect our financial condition and earnings. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on OTTI.\nPeriodic regulatory reviews may affect our operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to periodic reviews from state and federal regulators, which may impact our operations and our financial condition. As part of the regulatory review, the loan portfolio and the allowance for loan losses are evaluated. As a result, the incurred loss identified on loans or the assigned loan rating could change and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs. In addition, any downgrade in loan ratings could impact our level of impaired loans or classified assets. Any increase in our provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Findings of deficiencies in compliance with regulations could result in restrictions on our activities or even a loss in our financial holding company status.\nWe may be required to repurchase loans it has sold or indemnify loan purchasers under the terms of the sale agreements, which could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen we sell a mortgage loan, it agrees to repurchase or substitute a mortgage loan if it is later found to have breached any representation or warranty the Bank made about the loan or if the borrower is later found to have committed fraud in connection with the origination of the loan. While we have underwriting policies and procedures designed to avoid breaches of representations and warranties as well as borrower fraud, we cannot be sure that no breach or fraud will ever occur. Required repurchases, substitutions or indemnifications could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be a defendant from time to time in the future in a variety of litigation and other actions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe Company may be subject to claims or legal action from customers, employees or others. Financial institutions are facing a growing number of significant class actions, including those based on the manner or calculation of interest on loans and the assessments of overdraft fees. Future litigation could include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Like other financial institutions, the Company and the Bank are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against the Company, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm its reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed the Company\u2019s insurance coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, the Company may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may the Company be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures or interruptions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with, and depend on, third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial breaches in security of our vendors and our systems may have a significant effect on our business.\nFinancial institutions are under continuous threat of loss due to cyber-attacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. The most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud, denial of service, and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts. Loss can occur as a result of negative customer experience in the event of a successful denial of service attack that disrupts availability of our on-line banking services. The attempts to breach sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, could present significant operational, reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to us, if successful. The Company has security, backup and recovery systems in place and a comprehensive business continuity plan to ensure the systems will not be inoperable. The Company also has security in place to prevent unauthorized access to the systems. In addition, the Company has a cyber-liability insurance policy to protect against breaches of the Company and vendor systems. Third party service providers also are required to maintain similar controls. However, the Company cannot be certain the measures will be successful to prevent a security breach. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers. Security breaches also may increase reputational and legal risks, and the Company could experience an increase in expenses or losses resulting from such breaches.\nPotential misuse of funds or information by the Bank\u2019s employees or by third parties could result in damage to our customers for which we could be held liable, subject the Company to regulatory sanctions and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur employees handle a significant amount of funds, as well as financial and personal information. Although the Company has implemented systems to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds or information, there can be no assurance that such systems will be adequate or that a taking or misuse of funds or information by employees, by third parties who have authorized access to funds or information, or by third parties who are able to access funds or information without authorization will never occur. We could be held liable for such an event and could also be subject to regulatory sanctions. We could also incur the expense of developing additional controls to prevent future such occurrences. Although the Company has insurance to cover such potential losses, we cannot provide assurance that such insurance will be adequate to meet any liability. In addition, any loss of trust or confidence placed in the Company by our clients could result in a loss of business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information, whether through a breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could result in harm to such customer for which we may be held liable or incur sanctions.\nPotential misuse of funds or information by Home Savings\u2019 employees or by third parties could result in damage to Home Savings\u2019 customers for which Home Savings could be held liable, subject Home Savings to regulatory sanctions and otherwise adversely affect Home Savings\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nHome Savings\u2019 employees handle a significant amount of funds, as well as financial and personal information. Although Home Savings has implemented systems to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds or information, there can be no assurance that such systems will be adequate or that a taking or misuse of funds or information by employees, by third parties who have authorized access to funds or information, or by third parties who are able to access funds or information without authorization will never occur. Home Savings could be held liable for such an event and could also be subject to regulatory sanctions. Home Savings could also incur the expense of developing additional controls to prevent future such occurrences. Although Home Savings has insurance to cover such potential losses, Home Savings cannot provide assurance that such insurance will be adequate to meet any liability. In addition, any loss of trust or confidence placed in Home Savings by our customers could result in a loss of business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, our computer systems.\nHome Savings relies heavily on information systems to conduct our business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. Risks to the system result from a variety of factors, including the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, employees and others. As one example, some banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank\u2019s website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions. Home Savings is also at risk for the impact of natural disasters, terrorism and international hostilities on its systems or for the effects of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others. These risks also arise from the same types of threats to businesses with which Home Savings deals.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Accounting Changes\nLegislative, regulatory or accounting changes or actions could adversely impact the financial services industry and/or our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking laws and regulations are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance funds, and are not necessarily intended to benefit our shareholders. Changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact us. Future legislation or regulatory changes would likely increase compliance costs, along with possibly restricting the operations of United Community. In addition, regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses. In addition to laws, regulations and actions directed at the operations of banks in general, the CFPB has adopted regulations directed at consumer lending in particular. As discussed above, in October 2017, the CFPB issued the Payday Rule with respect to certain consumer loans to be effective on January 16, 2018, although compliance with most sections to be required starting on August 19, 2019. Then, on February 6, 2019, the CFPB issued two proposals with respect to the Payday Rule. These proposals do not change the provisions of the Payday Rule that address lender payment practices with respect to covered loans. The CFPB also stated that it will be considering other changes to the Payday Rule in response to requests received for exemptions of certain types of lenders or loan products and may commence separate additional rulemaking initiatives. The Company is currently assessing the expected effect of this new rule on the Bank\u2019s lending businesses and on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The costs of complying with this regulation or a determination to discontinue certain types of consumer lending in light of the expense of compliance could have an adverse effect on the financial conditions and results of operations of the Company. The Payday Rule applies to short-term loans that have terms of 45 days or less, longer-term balloon-payment loans and longer-term loans that have a cost of credit exceeding 36% per annum and for which the lender obtains a leveraged payment mechanism. Of these loan types, the Company does not offer either short-term loans that have terms of 45 days or less or longer-term balloon-payment loans. The Company may occasionally offer, on an accommodation basis, vehicle title loans, which qualify as longer-term loans which may have a cost of credit exceeding 36% per annum for which the Company obtains a leveraged payment mechanism. However, the Rule provides a conditional exemption for accommodation loans provided the lender and its affiliates have made 2,500 or fewer of these loans in the current year and have made 2,500 or fewer of these loans in the preceding calendar year. Based upon this information, the Payday Rule will have no impact on the Company.\nIn addition to laws, regulations and actions directed at the operations of banks, proposals to reform the housing finance market could negatively affect our ability to sell loans.\nAlthough it is impossible for the Company to predict at this time what changes in laws and regulations will be implemented and the effect they will have on the Company and the rest of our industry, it is possible that the Company\u2019s revenue could decrease, its interest expense could increase and deposit insurance premiums could change, and steps may need to be taken to increase qualifying capital. The Company\u2019s operating and compliance costs could increase and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to the Company\u2019s taxes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by the Company\u2019s customers, including changes in the deductibility of mortgage loan related expenses, may adversely affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for the Company\u2019s loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on the Company\u2019s customers could result in defaults on the loans the Bank has made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which the Company has invested.\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, formally known as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d was enacted into law. This new tax legislation, among other changes, limits the amount of state, federal and local taxes that taxpayers are permitted to deduct on their individual tax returns and eliminates other deductions in their entirety. Such limits and eliminations may result in customer defaults on loans the Bank has made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which we have invested.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nIncreased bank failures for several years commencing in 2008 greatly increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the deposit insurance fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC took a number of actions, including increasing assessment rates of insured institutions, requiring riskier institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring in rate adjustments based on secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels, changing the assessment base and requiring a prepayment of assessments for over three years.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that the Bank is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional financial institution failures, the Bank may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums. Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and its ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at the current rate or at all. The FDIC has recently adopted rules revising its assessments in a manner benefitting banks with assets totaling less than $10 billion. There can be no assurance, though, that assessments will not be changed in the future.\nChanges in accounting standards, policies, estimates or procedures could impact our reported financial condition or results of operations.\nEntities that set generally applicable accounting standards, such as the FASB, the SEC, and other regulatory boards, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restatement of the Company\u2019s financial statements for prior periods.\nIn June 2016, FASB issued a new accounting standard for recognizing current expected credit losses, commonly referred to as CECL. CECL will result in earlier recognition of credit losses and requires consideration of not only past and current events but also reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. The Company will be required to comply with the new standard in the first quarter of 2020. Upon adoption of CECL, credit loss allowances may increase, which would decrease retained earnings and regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators have adopted a regulation that will allow banks to phase in the day-one impact of CECL on regulatory capital over three years. CECL implementation poses operational risk, including the failure to properly transition internal processes or systems, which could lead to call report errors, financial misstatements, or operational losses.\nManagement\u2019s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods in order to ensure that they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nManagement has identified several accounting policies that are considered significant to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates about these matters, no assurance can be given that the application of alternative policies or methods might not result in the Company reporting materially different amounts.\nThe significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRegulation.\u201d", "PERMNO": 86299, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "UCFC"}
