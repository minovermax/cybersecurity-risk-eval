{"cik": "1575879", "company": "Caesars Acquisition Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Pending Acquisition of the Company by Caesars Entertainment\nWe may not be able to consummate our recently announced acquisition by CEC in the anticipated timeframe, or at all.\nAs previously announced, on December 22, 2014, we entered into the Merger Agreement with CEC, pursuant to which, subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, CAC will merge with and into CEC, with CEC as the surviving company. There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the consummation of the Merger with CEC, and completion of the Merger is contingent upon customary closing conditions, including approval of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders as well as CEC\u2019s stockholders and receipt of certain regulatory approvals. In addition to obtaining the stockholder approvals, consummation of the Merger is also subject to other conditions, including the CEOC restructuring plan having been confirmed by the bankruptcy court and minimum cash conditions for CGP LLC, as well as CEC and CERP. Failure to obtain the required approvals within the expected time frame, or having to make significant changes to the structure, terms, or conditions of the Merger to obtain such approvals, may result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Merger. There can be no assurance that these conditions of the Merger will be satisfied.\nEven if the CEOC restructuring plan is confirmed, under certain circumstances the Exchange Ratio may be adjusted or the Merger Agreement may be terminated.\nWe can therefore give you no assurance that the Merger will be consummated, in which case we would not realize the anticipated benefits of having completed the Merger, which may adversely affect us.\nThe combined company will require significant liquidity to fund CEOC\u2019s emergence from Chapter 11 and to achieve successful integration and achieve targeted synergies post-closing.\nAt emergence from Chapter 11, CEOC will be required to or may deem it advisable to settle in cash certain obligations (such as professional fees, certain accrued and unpaid interest, and debt obligations) that matured during the Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases. Additionally, based on the reorganization plan that CEOC has proposed, if the Bankruptcy Court approves such plan, Caesars Entertainment will be required to (i) contribute over $400 million to pay a forbearance fee, for general corporate purposes and to fund sources and uses and (ii) purchase up to approximately $1.0 billion of new equity in the restructured CEOC and its subsidiaries. As a result of these payments and investments, Caesars Entertainment may have less cash available in future periods for investments and operating expenses and, as result, the confirmation of the CEOC reorganization plan and emergence of CEOC from bankruptcy may have a negative impact on the combined company and on its ability to sustain its operations.\nWhile the Merger with CEC is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could disrupt our business.\nWe have experienced and, whether or not the pending Merger with CEC is completed, we may continue to experience disruption of our current plans and operations due to the pending Merger, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our employees and other key personnel may have uncertainties about the effect of the pending Merger, and those uncertainties may impact our ability to retain, recruit and hire key personnel while the Merger is pending or if it is not consummated. To date, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger with CEC, and these fees and costs are payable by us whether or not the proposed Merger is consummated. Furthermore, we cannot predict how our suppliers and customers will view or react to the proposed Merger, and some may be hesitant to do business with us in light of uncertainties about our ability to perform due to the proposed acquisition of us by CEC. If we are unable to reassure our customers and suppliers to continue transacting business with us, whether or not the proposed Merger is consummated, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are required to operate our business in the ordinary course, and we are also subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the proposed Merger without the consent of CEC, including, among other things, certain restrictions on our ability to enter new lines of business; make certain investments and acquisitions; sell, transfer, lease, dispose of or grant our assets; enter into certain contracts; incur indebtedness; and make certain capital expenditures. These restrictions, which could be in place for an extended period of time if the consummation of the Merger is delayed, could prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities and may otherwise harm our business, financial results and operations.\nIn the event that the pending Merger with CEC is not completed, the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results may be negatively impacted.\nAs noted above, the conditions to the completion of the Merger with CEC may not be satisfied, and even if the CEOC restructuring plan is confirmed, under certain circumstances the Exchange Ratio may be adjusted or the Merger Agreement may\nbe terminated. If the Merger with CEC is not completed for any reason, we would still be liable for significant transaction costs and the focus of our management would have been diverted from seeking other potential opportunities without realizing any benefits of the completed Merger. If we do not complete the Merger, certain litigation against us will remain outstanding and not be released. If we do not complete the Merger, the price of our common stock may decline significantly from the current market price, which may reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.\nIf the proposed Merger is not completed or we are not otherwise acquired, we may consider other strategic alternatives, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nIf the proposed Merger with CEC is not completed, our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") will review and consider various alternatives available to us, including, among others, continuing as a public company with no material changes to our business or capital structure or other alternative transactions. Any alternative transaction may involve various additional risks to our business, including, among others, distraction of our management team and associated expenses similar to those described above in connection with the proposed Merger, our ability to consummate an alternative transaction, the valuation assigned to our business in the alternative transaction, our ability or a potential buyer\u2019s ability to access capital on acceptable terms or at all and other variables that may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are subject to litigation initiated in connection with the Merger, which could be time consuming and divert the resources and the attention of management.\nCAC and the individual members of our Board of Directors have been named as defendants in certain lawsuits relating to the Merger Agreement and the proposed Merger, and may be named in additional lawsuits relating to the Merger Agreement and the proposed Merger. The lawsuits filed to date generally allege that the directors breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in a flawed sales process, by approving an inadequate price, and by agreeing to provisions that would allegedly preclude another interested buyer from making a financially superior proposal to acquire the company. The defense of any such lawsuits, and any additional lawsuits relating to the Merger Agreement and the proposed Merger, may be expensive and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Merger may be completed on terms different than those contained in the Merger Agreement.\nPrior to the completion of the Merger, the parties may, by their mutual agreement, amend or alter the terms of the Merger Agreement, including with respect to, among other things, the merger consideration to be received by our stockholders or any covenants or agreements with respect to the parties\u2019 respective operations pending completion of the Merger. In addition, either party may choose to waive certain requirements of the Merger Agreement, including some conditions to closing the Merger. Any such amendments, alterations or waivers may have negative consequences to the other parties or their respective stockholders, including the possibility that consideration paid in the Merger may be reduced.\nOur stockholders cannot be certain of the date they will receive the merger consideration or of the aggregate value of the merger consideration they will receive.\nThe date that our stockholders will receive the merger consideration depends on the completion date of the Merger, which is uncertain. In no event will the Merger be completed later than August 6, 2016 unless CAC and CEC otherwise agree. The date that the Merger becomes effective may be later than the date of the special meeting of our stockholders to approve the Merger, and at the time of our special meeting, our stockholders will not know the exact market value of the CEC Common Stock that they will receive upon completion of the Merger. The dollar value of the consideration received by our stockholders will depend upon the market value of CEC Common Stock at the effective time of the Merger, and such dollar value may be different from, and lower than, the dollar value of the merger consideration today or the date of the special meeting of our stockholders to approve the Merger.\nFurthermore, the Exchange Ratio fixed in the Merger Agreement is subject to adjustment during the Adjustment Period and may be adjusted for changes in the market price of either CAC Common Stock or CEC Common Stock. Accordingly, any change in the price of CEC Common Stock prior to the Merger may affect the market value of the merger consideration that our stockholders will receive as a result of the Merger.\nRisks Related to CGP LLC's Continued Dependence on Caesars Entertainment\nCAC and CGP LLC (including CGPH) are dependent on CES, CEOC and its subsidiaries to provide corporate services, back-office support and business advisory services through the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement and the CES Enterprise Services Agreement. CAC and CGP LLC cannot operate without the services provided by subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment and will be adversely affected if the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement is terminated.\nPursuant to the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement, CEOC and its subsidiaries provide corporate services, back-office support and business advisory services to CAC and CGP LLC. Additionally, pursuant to the CES Enterprise Services Agreement, CES provides corporate services and back-office support to CGPH. Moreover, CES provides management services to CGP LLC owned casinos. CAC and CGP LLC have a very short history of operating casinos and online entertainment. Therefore, the business and operations of CAC and CGP LLC are dependent on the services provided by Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries, and CAC and CGP LLC cannot operate without these services. If the quality of the services provided by Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries deteriorates, or if the terms under which Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries provide such services change in a manner that is adverse to CGP LLC, it could have a material adverse effect on CAC and CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, if the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement were to be terminated, or if Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries were to suffer significant liquidity or operational difficulties, becoming incapable of providing support and management services (or unable to provide such services at agreed upon levels) to CAC or CGP LLC or cease operations altogether, CAC and/or CGP LLC would no longer have access to the operational support and management expertise provided by Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries and it could have a material adverse effect on CAC and CGP LLC\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. Any failure by CAC or CGP LLC to obtain the operational and management support of Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries, and particularly any failure by CGP LLC to obtain Caesars Entertainment\u2019s expertise in operating casinos or maintaining access to the Total Rewards loyalty program, would adversely affect CAC and/or CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls that existed at December 31, 2014. If the material weakness is not remediated promptly or if we fail to establish and maintain an effective internal control environment, our ability to both timely and accurately report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires companies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute each year, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting, our management is required to assess and issue assertions concerning our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs of December 31, 2014, management identified a material weakness as described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures within this report. Accordingly, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of December 31, 2014.\nThe existence of this material weakness could have an adverse effect on management\u2019s ability to prevent or detect material errors on a timely basis. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business and our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nAlthough we believe we are taking appropriate actions to remediate the weakness we identified to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, we have taken measures to ensure the accuracy of our financial statements to date and will continue such measures in the future until we have remediated the material weakness as described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nWe do not control CES, and the interests of our co-investors may not align with our interests.\nCEOC, CERP and CGPH are members of CES, and CGPH and its subsidiaries will rely on CES to provide us with intellectual property licenses and property management services, among other services. Each member of CES is required to contribute as necessary to fund CES\u2019s operating costs and capital requirements in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement that governs CES. The amount CGPH will be required to fund following its initial contribution may be greater than its initial contribution, and will be subject to the review and approval of the CES steering committee. CGPH, CEOC and CERP control CES through its steering committee, which is comprised of one representative from each of CGPH, CEOC and CERP. In the event that CGPH interests do not align with those of CEOC or CERP, the interests of CEOC or CERP may be met before CGPH. In addition, certain decisions by CES may not be made without unanimous consent of the members, including CGPH. These actions include any decision with respect to liquidation or dissolution of CES, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all the assets of CES, usage of CES assets in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of CES, material amendment to CES\u2019s operating agreement, admission of new investors to CES and filing of any bankruptcy or similar action by CES. Thus,\nany Member of CES may block those actions requiring unanimous consent of the Members of CES notwithstanding that such actions are in our interest.\nCGP LLC is dependent on the expertise of Caesars Entertainment's senior management, who may not be directly invested in CGP LLC's success, which may have an adverse effect on CGP LLC and/or CAC\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nCGP LLC relies a great deal on the expertise and guidance of Caesars Entertainment's senior management who do not receive direct compensation from CGP LLC. As a result, Caesars Entertainment's senior management may devote substantially less time to the business and operations of CGP LLC than were they to be employed by CGP LLC. Senior management that is not invested in the success of CGP LLC's business may have an adverse effect on CGP LLC and/or CAC\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nLoss of the services of any key personnel from Caesars Entertainment could have a material adverse effect on the business of CGP LLC.\nThe leadership of Caesars Entertainment's senior management, has been a critical element of Caesars Entertainment's success. The advisory and management services provided to CGP LLC depend on this senior management. The death or disability of, or other extended or permanent loss of services, or any negative market or industry perception of Caesar Entertainment\u2019s senior management could have a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's business. CGP LLC is not protected by key man insurance or similar life insurance covering members of Caesars Entertainment's senior management, nor does CGP LLC have employment agreements with any of Caesars Entertainment's senior management.\nA default by Caesars Entertainment on certain of its debt obligations could adversely affect CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nCaesars Entertainment is a highly leveraged company and has pledged a significant portion of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries as collateral under certain of its debt obligations, including the trademarks for which CIE has licensed the right to use, including \"Caesars,\" \"Total Rewards\" and \"Harrah's.\" CEOC and its subsidiaries that are the owners of these trademarks filed for bankruptcy in January 2015. The stock of CEOC is also pledged to secure these debt obligations. If Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries were to default on these obligations, its lenders could exercise significant influence over CGP LLC's business. CGP LLC is dependent on a number of services from Caesars Entertainment, CEOC, and other subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment, pursuant to the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement, CGPH\u2019s CES Enterprise Services Agreement and CIE's Shared Services Agreement. If Caesars Entertainment and/or its subsidiaries file for bankruptcy protection under the U.S. bankruptcy code, their filing may materially and adversely affect CGP LLC\u2019s assets and operations. For example, in the event of a default by Caesars Entertainment, its lenders or their successors may elect to reject the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement or the CES Enterprise Services Agreement as an executory contract in a bankruptcy proceeding. Furthermore, in the event of such a default, Caesars Entertainment's lenders also may seek to reject CIE's cross marketing and trademark license agreement with Caesars Entertainment in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding and, as a result, CIE would no longer have licenses to use certain trademarks owned by Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries. The result of this influence and any related disruption in CGP LLC's business could have a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe value of the CEOC Notes held by CAC would be impaired in the event of a default by Caesars Entertainment on certain of its debt obligations and such impairment could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nCaesars Entertainment is a highly leveraged company and has significant obligations for interest payments and restrictions due to its indebtedness. If CEOC is unable to pay the interest when due under their outstanding indebtedness, or otherwise defaults on their debt obligations, the value of the CEOC Notes held by CAC would be impaired. An impairment in the value of the CEOC Notes could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nCGP LLC has an obligation to give a right of first refusal for any development opportunities to Caesars Entertainment, but Caesars Entertainment has no obligation to give any development opportunities to CGP LLC. Caesars Entertainment may keep all potential development opportunities for itself. CGP LLC would need to rely on a separate party to pursue any opportunities without the approval and assistance of Caesars Entertainment.\nCGP LLC is required to first provide any potential development opportunities to Caesars Entertainment to be considered by a committee of the Caesars Entertainment board of directors comprised of disinterested directors. CGP LLC can only proceed with such investment or opportunity to the extent such Caesars Entertainment committee declines the opportunity for itself or CEOC. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, and Director Independence. If the committee provides an opportunity to CGP LLC, we expect that CGP LLC will retain a 50% interest in the management fee to be received by Caesars Entertainment, unless otherwise agreed. However, because each opportunity will be negotiated as a separate transaction, there can be no assurances that CGP LLC and Caesars Entertainment will share equally (or that CGP LLC will share at all) in the management fee. If the committee does not provide the opportunity to CGP LLC, the\ncommittee can also decide to keep the opportunity for Caesars Entertainment. No assurances can be provided that the committee will ever provide an opportunity to CGP LLC.\nAlthough certain employees of each of the Sponsors are on the boards of directors of Caesars Entertainment and CAC, the certificates of incorporation of both companies provide that neither the Sponsors nor directors have any obligation to present any corporate opportunity to Caesars Entertainment or CAC. Accordingly, the Sponsors may pursue gaming, entertainment or other activities outside of Caesars Entertainment or CAC and have no obligation to present such opportunity to Caesars Entertainment or CAC; however, if any choose to present such opportunity to Caesars Entertainment or CAC, then such opportunity must follow the rights of first offer.\nIf the committee declines an opportunity altogether and CGP LLC pursues the opportunity without the support of Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC will be required to identify and obtain the necessary services from a third-party. No assurances can be provided that CGP LLC will be able to find a third-party to pursue an opportunity without Caesars Entertainment and any services provided may be more expensive than, or of less quality than, those that are provided by Caesars Entertainment, and as a result, could have a material adverse impact on the success of the opportunity.\nCaesars Entertainment's interests may conflict with CGP LLC\u2019s interests.\nThe interests of Caesars Entertainment could conflict with CGP LLC's interests. Caesars Entertainment is in a casino and entertainment business similar to CGP LLC and may, from time to time in the future, pursue for itself acquisitions that would be complementary to CGP LLC's business, in which case, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities would not be available to us. Without access to acquisition opportunities, CGP LLC will be limited in growing its business.\nThe success of CGP LLC's business depends in part on its continued participation in Caesars' Total Rewards loyalty program. If CIE and the casinos owned by CGP LLC are unable to access the Total Rewards loyalty program database, it could have a material adverse impact on CGP LLC's business.\nThe success of CGP LLC's business depends in part on its ability to direct targeted marketing efforts to important casino and hospitality customers. The ability of CGP LLC's business to undertake those marketing efforts depends to a significant extent on its continued participation in the Total Rewards loyalty program owned and maintained by CEOC and its subsidiaries, and following its commencement of operations, licensed to CES. In connection with this program, CIE and the casinos owned by CGP LLC can develop information which allows them to track casino play and award complimentaries and other promotional opportunities to their customers. Complimentaries and other similar rewards are customarily offered by casino and gaming facilities to their customers and are important incentives to those customers. If CIE and the casinos owned by CGP LLC are unable to access the Total Rewards loyalty program database, it could have a material adverse impact on CGP LLC's business. Participation in the Total Rewards loyalty program is one of our competitive strengths and our business and growth strategy are, in part, based on tracked play and targeted marketing efforts.\nIn the past, the removal of the Total Rewards loyalty program from a casino property has resulted in negative impacts on such property\u2019s financial results. Similarly, if we are unable to access the Total Rewards loyalty program database, we expect our annual revenue would decline, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nCIE and CGP LLC license their right to use and sublicense various trademarks and service marks from Caesars Entertainment and certain of its affiliates. Accordingly, if a third-party successfully challenges Caesars Entertainment or its affiliates' ownership of, or right to use, the Caesars-related marks or if CIE or CGP LLC is unable to stop unauthorized use of such marks, or if Caesars Entertainment or its affiliates use such marks in a way that negatively impacts the value of such marks, CIE's and CGP LLC's business or results of operations could be harmed.\nCIE and CGP LLC has licensed the right to use certain trademarks and service marks owned or used by various affiliates of Caesars Entertainment, including Caesars World, Inc., Caesars License Company, LLC and CEOC. These licensed trademarks and service marks include, among others, \"Caesars,\" \"Harrah\u2019s,\" and \"Total Rewards.\" See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, and Director Independence. CIE's and CGP LLC\u2019s rights to use these trademarks and service marks are among its most valuable assets. All of these entities filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2015, as more fully discussed in the risk factor below entitled \u201cA default by Caesars Entertainment on certain of its debt obligations could adversely affect CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\u201d\nIf the existing licensing arrangements were terminated and CIE and CGP LLC fail to enter into new arrangements in respect of these marks, CIE and CGP LLC could lose their rights to use these marks and the corresponding domain names, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and operating results. If a third-party successfully challenges Caesars Entertainment or its affiliates\u2019 ownership of, or right to use, these marks (including, for example, due to Caesars Entertainment or its affiliates\u2019 failure to file for protection of such marks), such a challenge could also have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, as the entities from whom CIE licenses the right to use such marks has entered into a bankruptcy proceeding, CIE\u2019s rights to use some\nor all of such marks could be terminated, which could also have a material adverse effect on CIE's and CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, these trademarks and service marks are used by Caesars Entertainment and its affiliates around the United States and internationally. Any negative events associated with the use of these marks by Caesars Entertainment or its affiliates may be out of CGP LLC's control, and may negatively impact the \"Caesars\", \"Harrah\u2019s\" or \"Total Rewards\" brands, which could harm CIE's CGP LLC's business and results of operations.\nFailure by CES or CEOC and its subsidiaries to protect the trademarks, technology and other intellectual property that CGP LLC uses could have a negative impact on the value of CGPH\u2019s brand names and adversely affect our business. In addition, CES or CEOC and its subsidiaries may have the right to limit the expansion of scope or usage of our intellectual property.\nCGP LLC currently licenses from CES and CEOC and its subsidiaries, intellectual property and technology material to its overall business strategy, and CGP LLC regards such intellectual property and technology to be an important element of its success. CGP LLC relies on CES and CEOC and its subsidiaries to seek to establish and maintain proprietary rights in such intellectual property and technology through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws. In addition, CGP LLC relies on CES and CEOC and its subsidiaries to maintain the trade secrets and confidential information licensed to CGP LLC by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. Despite these efforts to protect the proprietary rights on which CGP LLC relies, parties may infringe such intellectual property and use licensed information and technology that CGP LLC regards as proprietary and CGPH\u2019s rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. Monitoring the unauthorized use of CGP LLC\u2019s licensed intellectual property and technology is difficult. Litigation by CEOC and its subsidiaries or CES, as applicable, may be necessary to enforce the intellectual property rights and other rights on which we rely or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. We cannot assure you that all of the steps that CGP LLC, CEOC and its subsidiaries or CES have taken or will take to protect the licensed trademarks that CGP LLC uses in the United States will be adequate to prevent imitation of such trademarks by others. The unauthorized use or reproduction of the trademarks that CGPH uses could diminish the value of its brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect its business. In addition, the expansion of the scope or use of CGP LLC\u2019s intellectual property licensed from CEOC or CES, as applicable, in many cases is subject to the consent of CEOC or CES. Accordingly, CGP LLC may not be able to take advantage of new applications or uses of these licensed trade names, trademarks or other intellectual property without the consent of CEOC or CES, which may adversely affect CGP LLC\u2019s ability to compete or expand its business scope.\nCIE may be reliant on Caesars Entertainment to obtain online gaming licenses in many commercial jurisdictions and if the affiliation is terminated, or costs to maintain such affiliation exceed revenue generated from such affiliation, it would adversely affect CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business and result of operations.\nNevada, Delaware and New Jersey have enacted laws that require online casinos to also have a license to operate a brick-and-mortar casino, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate. If, like Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey, other U.S. jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing real money casino gaming subject to this brick-and-mortar requirement, CIE may be unable to offer online real money gaming in such jurisdictions if CIE does not have or is unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction. If CIE is able to offer online real money gaming in such jurisdictions because of CIE's affiliation with Caesars Entertainment, CIE will be reliant on continuing its relationship with Caesars Entertainment, and there can be no assurances that Caesars Entertainment will continue to maintain such affiliation. If CIE's affiliation with Caesars Entertainment is terminated or the costs to maintain such affiliation exceed revenue generated from online real money gaming, it would adversely affect CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business and result of operations.\nA bankruptcy court may conclude that each of the Transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions constitutes a financing rather than a true sale and as a result we would no longer have ownership and control over assets sold or contributed to CGP LLC to the same extent as we do now.\nFor the years ended years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, Caesars Entertainment and its consolidated subsidiaries reported a net loss of $2,771 million and $2,948 million, respectively. Furthermore, Caesars Entertainment and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as CEOC and its consolidated subsidiaries, have reported significant net losses during the past three fiscal years. In a bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment or any of its subsidiaries (such as the bankruptcy proceeding of CEOC and certain of its subsidiaries that was filed in January 2015) that sold or contributed assets to CGP LLC, including CEOC, the court may conclude that each of the Transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions constitutes a disguised financing rather than a true sale. In such case, the court would deem CGP LLC's assets as belonging to Caesars Entertainment, and consider us to be a lender to Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries to the extent of the purchase price CGP LLC paid for those assets. While we should have a claim against Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries for the amounts paid to them for the assets, we would no longer have ownership and control over the assets to the same extent as we do now. Moreover, if our claim against Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries is considered a financing, no guaranty exists that our claim will be deemed a secured claim entitled to a priority right of repayment from the assets, rather than a general unsecured claim against Caesars Entertainment\u2019s or\nCEOC\u2019s bankruptcy estate that shares pro rata with other creditors in any recovery from the residual value of the bankruptcy estate. Finally, a risk exists that any such claim might be primed in favor of a debtor-in-possession financing, or that the court might equitably subordinate our claim to those of other creditors, recharacterize the claim as equity or otherwise not allow the claim (including on equitable grounds).\nA bankruptcy court may substantively consolidate the bankruptcy estates of Caesars Entertainment and its debtor subsidiaries with CGP LLC, which would, among other things, allow the creditors of the bankrupt entities to satisfy their claims from the combined assets of the consolidated entities, including CGP LLC.\nEven though CGP LLC has certain bankruptcy remote features that restrict its ability to file for bankruptcy relief, there can be no assurance that a bankruptcy court will not direct CGP LLC's or any of its subsidiaries' substantive consolidation with Caesars Entertainment or a subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment in a bankruptcy case of Caesars Entertainment (including the pending bankruptcy of CEOC and certain of its subsidiaries filed in January 2015) or such subsidiary even if CGP LLC or its subsidiaries do not themselves file a bankruptcy petition. CGP LLC's or its subsidiaries' substantive consolidation with Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries in their bankruptcy cases would, among other things, allow the creditors of the bankrupt entities to satisfy their claims from the combined assets of the consolidated entities, including CGP LLC and its subsidiaries. This may dilute the value of distributions available for recovery to CGP LLC's creditors, and may prevent recovery by our stockholders of any value at all if the combined creditor claims exceed the combined value of the entities. In addition, substantive consolidation with Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries\u2019 bankruptcies may subject our assets and operations to the automatic stay, and may impair CGP LLC's ability to operate independently, as well as otherwise restrict our operations and capacity to function as a standalone enterprise.\nThe CEOC bankruptcy filing might trigger an independent investigation of the Transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions, and expose our and CGP LLC's contractual relationships with Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries to heightened scrutiny.\nAs CEOC and certain of its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy relief in January 2015, it may result in an independent investigation of the Transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions, including the formation of CES. For example, a trustee or examiner may be appointed in the CEOC bankruptcy case with the power to investigate the Transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions and determine, with the benefit of hindsight, whether such transactions overall, and their constituent parts (including the formation of CES), were fair and equitable and otherwise beneficial to CEOC and its subsidiaries that filed for bankruptcy relief. Additionally, any committees appointed in the CEOC bankruptcy case could conduct a similar investigation. Any such investigations may impose significant costs and expense on us and CGP LLC, and may divert management from its ability to conduct our business. In addition, we would expect that stakeholders of CEOC and its subsidiaries, including any committee appointed in such bankruptcy cases, would re-evaluate all of our and CGP LLC's contractual and business relationships with CEOC and its subsidiaries, and with CES. This may result in materially altered terms and conditions that may be economically unfavorable to investors in CAC, and may divert significant management resources.\nWe are subject to fraudulent transfer litigation that may require us to return the assets acquired in the Transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions, or their value, to Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries.\nCreditors of Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries may sue us and/or CGP LLC under state or federal bankruptcy law in an effort to recover, for their benefit, the assets we acquired in the Transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions as fraudulent transfers. (See Item 3. Legal Proceedings above for a discussion of these proceedings.) As a general matter, fraudulent transfer law allows a creditor to recover assets, or their value, from an initial or subsequent transferee if the debtor conveyed the assets with an actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors, or if the transfer was a constructive fraud. A constructive fraud exists even in the absence of an actual intent to defraud creditors. The principal elements of a constructive fraud are a transfer, made while a debtor was insolvent or that rendered a debtor insolvent, for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration or that left the debtor with less than sufficient capital with which to conduct its business. A court may \"collapse\" the component steps of the restructuring into a single set of integrated transactions to determine whether the restructuring overall effected a fraudulent transfer. If we and/or CGP LLC lose the lawsuits described above, we may have to return the assets or their value to Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries or be forced to pay additional amounts therefor.\nWe strongly believe there is no merit to the actions identified in (Item 3. Legal Proceedings) and will defend ourselves vigorously and seek appropriate relief should any action be brought. If a court were to find that the transfers and sales in the Transaction and the Asset Purchase Transactions were improper, that could trigger a default under the debt that we raised to finance these transfers. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCES may be subject to fraudulent transfer or other litigation that may result in its unwinding, or its licensing agreements with CEOC may otherwise be rescinded or terminated.\nCreditors of Caesars Entertainment, CEOC and their subsidiaries may commence an action against CES under state or federal bankruptcy law in an effort to rescind, avoid or otherwise terminate, for their benefit, the licensing agreements CEOC entered into with CES. Alternatively, as CEOC and certain of its subsidiaries has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they may reject their licensing agreements with CES. If CES can no longer enforce such licensing agreements, it may be unable to perform under its licensing agreements with CGP LLC and its subsidiaries. As a result, among other things, CGP LLC and its subsidiaries may no longer have access to the Total Rewards loyalty program and may no longer be able to use certain intellectual property, such as the Caesars trademark, which could have a material adverse effect on CAC and CGP LLC\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur operations depend on material contracts with third parties, including Caesars Entertainment, the continued enforcement of which may be adversely impacted by a bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment or CES.\nA debtor operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code may exercise certain rights that may adversely affect our contractual relations and ability to participate in the Caesars Entertainment system. For example, the protection of the statutory automatic stay which arises by operation of section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case prohibits us from terminating a contract with CEOC or any of its debtor subsidiaries. The Bankruptcy Code also invalidates clauses that permit the termination of contracts automatically upon the filing by one of the parties of a bankruptcy petition or which are conditioned on a party\u2019s insolvency. Meanwhile in this circumstance, we would ordinarily be required to continue performing our obligations under such agreement. As a practical matter, legal proceedings to obtain relief from the automatic stay and to enforce rights to payments or terminate agreements can be time consuming, costly and uncertain as to outcome.\nIn addition, under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor may decide whether to assume or reject an executory contract, including the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement, the management contracts for all of the casino properties owned by CGP LLC, the shared service agreement with CIE, or upon its formation, any licensing agreement with CES. Assumption of a contract would permit the debtor to continue operating under the assumed contract; provided that the debtor (i) immediately cures all existing defaults thereunder or provides adequate assurance that such defaults will be promptly cured, (ii) compensates the non-debtor party for any actual monetary loss incurred as a result of the debtor\u2019s default or provides adequate assurance that such compensation will be forthcoming and (iii) provides the non-debtor party with adequate assurance of future performance under the contract. As a general matter, a bankruptcy court approves a debtor\u2019s assumption of a contract as long as assumption appears to be in the best interest of the debtor's estate, the debtor is able to perform and it is a good business decision to assume the contract. Subject to bankruptcy court approval and satisfaction of the \"business judgment\" rule, a debtor in chapter 11 may reject an executory contract, and rejection of an executory contract in a chapter 7 case may occur automatically by operation of law. If a debtor rejects an executory contract, the non-debtor party to the contract generally has an unsecured claim against the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estate for breach of contract damages arising from the rejection. On request of any party to such contract, a bankruptcy court may order the debtor to determine within a specific period of time whether to assume or reject an executory contract.\nFurther, CEOC and its subsidiaries that filed for bankruptcy protection, as debtors, may seek bankruptcy court approval to assume material contracts, including among others, the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement, the CES Enterprise Services Agreement, the CIE Cross-Marketing Agreement or other valuable license agreements under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and may also seek to assign such agreement to a third-party. A debtor may also seek to reject such contracts. If CEOC, for example, rejects the CES Enterprise Services Agreement, CES may not be able to provide us operational support and management expertise, with the result that we may lack sufficient support to manage our operations, and may no longer be able to use certain licensed intellectual property, such as certain trademarks.\nIn addition, Caesars Entertainment, as a debtor, may attempt to reject the CGP LLC Operating Agreement as an executory contract. This might affect our continued existence, and other corporate governance rights. It may also relieve Caesars Entertainment from performing its obligations under CGP LLC's limited liability company agreement, including honoring its obligations under the liquidation right and call right.\nClaims of our stockholders and CGP LLC against Caesars Entertainment or CEOC in a Caesars Entertainment or CEOC bankruptcy might be equitably subordinated or disallowed.\nBankruptcy law allows the court to equitably subordinate claims to those of other creditors or equity holders based on inequitable conduct. A bankruptcy court may also recharacterize a claim for debt as equity, or not allow a claim for other reasons including on equitable grounds. Claims of insiders, including stockholders, are subject to heightened scrutiny and a court may find inequitable conduct in the form of overreaching or self-dealing transactions. If a claim is subordinated to those of other creditors or equity holders, or recharacterized as equity, the claim will likely receive no distribution from the bankruptcy estate unless the estate has enough assets to satisfy the non-subordinated creditors in full; a claim that is disallowed would not share in\nrecoveries from the estate to the extent of such disallowance. The equitably subordinated or disallowed claim need not necessarily relate to the inequitable conduct. Therefore, a damages claim arising from the rejection of an executory contract may be subordinated or disallowed based on conduct wholly unrelated to the contractual relationship itself. Under these principles, should a court determine that they are triggered in the bankruptcy of CEOC or in a bankruptcy of CEC, if one were to occur, claims of our stockholders and CGP LLC, including claims based on notes issued by Caesars Entertainment or CEOC or guarantees by Caesars Entertainment, may not share ratably with claims from other general unsecured creditors or may be disallowed.\nFollowing assignment of the management agreements to CES upon its commencing operations as of October 1, 2014, CGPH is dependent upon CES to operate CGPH's properties.\nEach of CGPH's properties is managed by CES. CGPH is dependent upon CES to provide the services necessary to operate CGPH's properties. CGPH does not have a history of operating casinos. Therefore, CGPH's properties are dependent on the services provided by CES and CGPH cannot operate CGPH's properties without these services. If the quality of the services provided by CES deteriorates, or the terms under which CES provides services change in a manner that is adverse to CGPH, it could have a material adverse effect on CGPH\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. Following the commencement of operations and receipt of regulatory approvals for CES, at CGPH\u2019s request, the property management agreements were assigned to CES. CES is a newly formed entity and will not receive the management fees under the property management agreements. Furthermore, CES is dependent upon its members (CGPH, CEOC and CERP) to provide it with the operating funds and capital requirements (the allocation of which shall be based on each member\u2019s ownership interest in CES) necessary to provide services under the property management agreements. If any of the members of CES fail to provide it with the operating funds necessary to operate CES, CES may not be able to fully provide the services required by the property management agreements to operate CGPH's properties.\nIn addition, if the property management agreements were to be terminated, or if CES were to suffer significant liquidity or operational difficulties, becoming incapable of providing property management services (or unable to provide such services at agreed upon level) to CGPH or cease operations altogether, CGPH may be unable to continue to operate its properties, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Caesars Growth Partners, LLC's Business\nCGP LLC may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of current or potential future acquisitions.\nOn May 20, 2014, we closed a transaction whereby CGP LLC (or one or more of its designated direct or indirect subsidiaries) agreed to acquire from Caesars Entertainment certain of its properties and related assets as more fully described further in Part I, Item 1 - Asset Purchase Transactions. There are incremental risks and uncertainties related to the Agreement and the Asset Purchase Transactions contemplated thereunder, many of which are outside of our control, including the following:\n\u2022the diversion of our management's attention from our ongoing business concerns:\n\u2022the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and/or others relating to the Transactions; and\n\u2022the amounts of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Asset Purchase Transactions.\nFor example, we and CGP LLC have been named in two separate lawsuits related to the Asset Purchase Transactions, as more fully described below in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. In addition, CGP LLC's ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, including, but not limited to the Asset Purchase Transactions, will depend, in part, on its ability to integrate the businesses of such acquired companies with its business. The combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time consuming process. This process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies, and may not result in the full benefits expected. The difficulties of combining the operations of two companies include, among others:\n\u2022coordinating marketing functions;\n\u2022undisclosed liabilities;\n\u2022unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, marketing and administration methods;\n\u2022retaining key employees;\n\u2022consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u2022obtaining all necessary gaming regulatory approvals.\nFor instance, CIE has been highly reliant on its acquisition of Playtika and other companies, including Buffalo Studios, to generate revenues. CGP LLC may not realize the expected benefits of future CIE acquisitions, if any, and may not continue to realize the benefits of the Buffalo Studios acquisition, due to one or more of the difficulties listed above or other difficulties associated with the combination of the operations of two or more companies. If CGP LLC is unable to realize in whole or in part the benefits anticipated for any current or future acquisitions, it could have a material adverse effect on its, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nCGP LLC may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nCGP LLC intends to continue to make significant investments to support its business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, expand into new markets, develop new games and features or enhance CIE\u2019s existing games, improve its operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel and technologies. Accordingly, CAC and CGP LLC may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If CAC raises additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we or CGP LLC secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. CAC and CGP LLC are newly formed entities and may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. For instance, the lack of operating history and relationship with Caesars Entertainment may impede CGP LLC's ability to raise debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurances that we could pursue a future offering of securities at an appropriate price to raise the necessary financing. If CAC and CGP LLC are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to them when they require it, their ability to continue to support CGP LLC's business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nCAC and CGP LLC do not have restrictions on their ability to raise debt and may highly leverage their capital structure, which could adversely affect CGP LLC's ability to pursue certain opportunities.\nCAC and CGP LLC have no restrictions on their ability to raise a significant amount of debt financing and/or alter their capital structures. Should CAC or CGP LLC significantly leverage themselves, CAC or CGP LLC will be subject to considerable interest payment expenses that could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. Further, once CAC has a highly leveraged capital structure, CGP LLC may lose certain advantages it has against competitors that have similar capital structures that makes pursuing new, capital-intensive, opportunities more challenging.\nWe may not realize any or all of our projected cost savings, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, CEC and CES have implemented certain cost savings programs and are in the process of identifying opportunities to improve profitability by reducing costs. For example, Caesars Entertainment and CES are currently in the process of reviewing its corporate level expenses and has identified cost savings, a portion of which would directly reduce our expenses. Any cost savings that we realize from such efforts may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, any cost savings that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues, or through increases in other expenses. For example, cutting advertising or marketing expenses may have an unintended negative affect on our revenues. These cost savings plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time. We cannot assure you that cost-savings initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that the benefits we expect will be achieved on a timely basis or at all.\nOur historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical financial information we have included in this Form 10-K has been prepared using assumptions and allocations that we believe are reasonable. However, such historical financial information does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a stand-alone entity separate from Caesars Entertainment during the periods presented. In addition, the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the future.\nCGP LLC's business may be subject to seasonal fluctuations which could result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nCGP LLC's business may be subject to some degree of seasonality. For example, in the case of CIE, it may experience seasonality based on the playing habits of its players. As the growth of CIE's business stabilizes, the seasonal fluctuations may become more evident. In the case of CGP LLC\u2019s casino properties, weather conditions may deter or prevent customers from reaching the facilities or undertaking trips. Such conditions would particularly affect customers who are traveling longer\ndistances to visit CGP LLC\u2019s casino properties. We believe the number of customer visits to CGP LLC's casino properties will fluctuate based on the season, with winter months experiencing lower visitation; however, volume of business generated by our Las Vegas properties is generally lower during the summer months. Seasonality may cause CIE and CGP LLC\u2019s casino properties working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume and timing of sales. These factors, among other things, make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect CIE and CGP LLC\u2019s casino properties ability to manage working capital and to predict financial results accurately, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThere may be a significant degree of difficulty in operating CGP LLC's businesses separately from Caesars Entertainment, and managing that process effectively could require a significant amount of management\u2019s time.\nThe separation from Caesars Entertainment could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the operation of CGP LLC's businesses. Management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to the separation, which will decrease the time they will have to manage their ordinary responsibilities. If management is not able to manage the separation effectively, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the separation, CGP LLC's businesses and operating results could suffer.\nCIE may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that it expects to achieve from the separation of its operations from Caesars Entertainment.\nAs a company with operations separate from Caesars Entertainment, we believe that CIE will benefit from, among other things, allowing its businesses to better focus their financial and operational resources on their specific businesses and be better positioned to dedicate resources to pursue appropriate growth opportunities and execute strategic plans best suited to their business in an efficient manner. We believe the separation will allow the management of CIE to design and implement corporate strategies and policies that are based primarily on the business characteristics and strategic decisions of their respective business, allowing them to more effectively respond to industry dynamics and allowing the creation of effective incentives for their management and employees that are more closely tied to their respective business performance. However, CIE may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect it to achieve as a company with operations separate from Caesars Entertainment in the time we expect, if at all.\nWe will be allocated taxable income from CGP LLC for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of whether we receive corresponding cash distributions from CGP LLC to pay our tax liability.\nBecause CGP LLC is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be allocated taxable income from CGP LLC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for each fiscal year according to the terms of the CGP LLC Operating Agreement. We will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on such income at the current U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, regardless of whether CGP LLC makes corresponding cash distributions to us to pay our tax liability. The CGP LLC Operating Agreement provides for quarterly cash tax distributions (other than in connection with a liquidation or certain partial liquidations) to be made to us and Caesars Entertainment, but there is no guarantee that such tax distributions (or other cash distributions from CGP LLC) will be sufficient for us to pay our tax liabilities.\nThere are no assurances that there will be future development opportunities for CGP LLC or that CGP LLC will obtain a development project.\nCGP LLC's ability to expand into new markets to pursue development opportunities depends on passage of legislation that legalizes gambling in new markets and Caesars Entertainment not exercising its right of first offer. Although in the past few years a number of states have passed legislation permitting the development of gaming facilities, there can be no assurances that such trend will continue, and it is possible that legislatures and public sentiment will turn against permitting the development of gaming facilities. Should the states pass no additional legislation for issuing licenses or permitting the development of gaming facilities, CGP LLC will be unable to pursue development opportunities in new markets. Moreover, even if new markets open up, there can be no assurances that Caesars Entertainment and/or CGP LLC will be successful in the bid process for any new development opportunities; therefore, there can be no assurances that CGP LLC will be able to enter those new markets. For example, CGP LLC recently bid for a gaming license in the State of New York but was not selected. Further, there can be no assurances that Caesars Entertainment will not exercise its right of first refusal, thereby depriving CGP LLC of access to any potential development project. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, and Director Independence.\nThe bonds of CEOC and other fixed rate securities we hold are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates and would decrease in value if the interest rate increases.\nAs of December 31, 2014, CAC holds approximately $290 million in aggregate principal amount of the CEOC Notes with fixed rates of interest. Fixed rate securities are sensitive to fluctuations in market interest rates and if interest rates increase, the fixed rate securities held by CAC will decrease in value. Currently, market interest rates have been at record low rates.\nAccordingly, an increase in market interest rates from current levels could cause the value of the fixed rate securities to decrease significantly.\nCGP LLC and CAC are subject to extensive governmental regulation and taxation policies, the enforcement of which could adversely impact CGP LLC\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCGP LLC and CAC are subject to extensive gaming regulations and political and regulatory uncertainty. Regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where CGP LLC operates have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit the gaming or other licenses of CGP LLC's casino properties or developments, impose substantial fines and take other actions, any one of which could adversely impact CGP LLC's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regulatory authorities in one or more jurisdictions may require CGP LLC or CAC to obtain new licenses in connection with the Transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions or due to future changes in regulation. For instance, the Missouri Gaming Commission is requiring that CAC obtain certain licenses related to the formation of CES even though neither CAC nor CGP LLC operate in Missouri. The failure of CAC to obtain a license from the Missouri Gaming Commission could adversely impact Caesars Entertainment\u2019s gaming license in Missouri. If other jurisdictions require CGP LLC or CAC to obtain new licenses in connection with its operations, the formation of CES or due to future changes in regulation, and CGP LLC or CAC is unable to obtain those licenses, it could adversely impact CGP LLC's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of CIE holding an online gaming license, its operations and activities are subject to various gaming laws and laws in Nevada and New Jersey. We also expect CIE to be subject to these or similar laws as CIE seeks licenses for online real money gaming in the United States. For example, CIE has obtained a license in Nevada as an \"operator of an interactive gaming system\" and obtained regulatory approval to launch online poker in Nevada. In addition, CIE obtained a license in New Jersey in November 2013 to operate internet gaming in New Jersey. Among these laws are various \"suitability\" requirements which could limit CIE's ability to conduct business with certain third parties, make certain acquisitions and otherwise freely conduct its business. The results of such restrictions could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurthermore, interpretations of laws and local regulations and ordinances on which we rely may change or be made conditional on certain other factors, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, Harrah\u2019s New Orleans is currently subject to a local ordinance in New Orleans related to the minimum number of people who must be employed at Harrah\u2019s New Orleans. A change in the interpretation of this ordinance or a change in this ordinance could force a reevaluation of staffing at that property in a manner that could adversely affect the financial results of Harrah\u2019s New Orleans.\nFurthermore, because we are subject to regulation in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and because regulatory agencies within each jurisdiction review our compliance with gaming laws in other jurisdictions, it is possible that gaming compliance issues in one jurisdiction may lead to reviews and compliance issues in other jurisdictions. For example, recent events in connection with Caesars Entertainment\u2019s role with the proposed development of a casino gaming facility by Sterling Suffolk Racecourse, LLC (\u201cSterling Suffolk\u201d), owner of Suffolk Downs racecourse in East Boston, Massachusetts, have resulted in reviews in several other jurisdictions arising out of a report issued to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission from the Director of the Investigations and Enforcement Bureau for the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (the \u201cBureau\u201d) in\nOctober 2013. That report raised certain issues for consideration when evaluating our suitability as a qualifier in Massachusetts and made a recommendation that Caesars Entertainment had not met our burden by clear and convincing evidence to establish our suitability. Although Caesars Entertainment strongly disagrees with the director\u2019s recommendation, Caesars Entertainment withdrew its application as a qualifier in Massachusetts at the request of Sterling Suffolk. Neither Caesars Entertainment nor any of its affiliates were found unsuitable by any licensing authority, but other gaming regulatory agencies have asked for information about the issues raised in the report from the Bureau, and we are in the process of providing that information. We cannot assure you that existing or future jurisdictions would not raise similar questions with respect to our suitability arising out of the Bureau\u2019s report, or with respect to matters that may arise in the future, and we cannot assure you that such issues will not adversely affect us or our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, individual jurisdictions have also considered legislation or referendums, such as bans on smoking in casinos and other entertainment and dining facilities, which could adversely impact the operations of CGP LLC's casino properties. For example, Maryland law prohibits smoking inside the Horseshoe Baltimore facility. Additionally, the city council in New Orleans recently enacted an ordinance restricting smoking indoors in public places, including in Harrah\u2019s New Orleans. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in such jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact CGP LLC's financial performance.\nThe casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate. From time to time, various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the\nadministration of such laws, including increases in tax rates, which would affect the industry. If adopted, such changes could adversely impact CGP LLC's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActs of terrorism, natural disasters, severe weather and political, economic and military conditions may impede CGP LLC's ability to operate or harm its financial results.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties. For example, a substantial number of the customers of CGP LLC\u2019s casinos in Las Vegas and New Orleans use air travel for transportation to and from the casino. As a result of terrorist acts, domestic and international travel was severely disrupted, which resulted in a decrease in customer visits to Las Vegas or New Orleans. We cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act, security alerts or war, uprisings, or hostilities in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, or other countries throughout the world, will continue to directly or indirectly impact CGP LLC's business and operating results. As a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future, premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased, and some types of insurance are no longer available. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely impacted. In addition, natural and man-made disasters such as major fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and oil spills, or severe or inclement weather affecting the ability of CGP LLC\u2019s casino customers to travel can have a negative impact on its results of operations. In most cases, we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster, but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases. Although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster, the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds, if any, is out of our control. In some cases, however, we may receive no proceeds from insurance. Additionally, a natural disaster affecting one or more of our properties may affect the level and cost of insurance coverage we may be able to obtain in the future, which may adversely affect our financial position. As our operations depend in part on our customers\u2019 ability to travel, severe or inclement weather can also have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nPolitical, economic and military conditions may directly affect CGP LLC's business by impeding its operations or player demand. In particular, a key portion of the operations and personnel of Playtika, a subsidiary of CIE and the operator of Slotomania, are located in Israel, a country located in a particularly volatile region. CIE also has approximately 300 employees in Ukraine, a country currently facing political unrest and hostilities. Any hostilities, or any future armed conflicts, political or economic instability or violence in the Middle East or further disruptions in Ukraine could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar laws and regulations could have a negative impact on us.\nCGP LLC is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, which exposes CGP LLC to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in engaging in a cross-border business and in each of the countries in which CGP LLC and its businesses transacts business. CGP LLC is subject to requirements imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit U.S. companies and their affiliates from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. Policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that CGP LLC has implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. If the employees, contractors or agents of Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC\u2019s casino properties and CIE fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing its international operations, CGP LLC may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to CGP LLC's international operations increase CGP LLC's cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. CGP LLC and its businesses also deal with significant amounts of cash in its operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws (\"AML\") or regulations, on which in recent years, governmental authorities have been increasingly focused, with a particular focus on the gaming industry, by any of our resorts could have a negative effect on our results of operations. As an example, a major gaming company recently settled a U.S. Attorney investigation into its AML practices. On October 11, 2013, a subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment received a letter from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the United States Department of the Treasury (\"FinCEN\"), stating that FinCEN is investigating Desert Palace, Inc. (the owner of Caesars Palace) for alleged violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (\"BSA\") based on a BSA examination of Caesars Palace previously conducted by the Internal Revenue Service to determine whether it is appropriate to assess a civil penalty and/or take additional enforcement action against Caesars Palace. Additionally, Caesars Entertainment has been informed that a federal grand jury investigation related to these matters is on-going. Caesars Entertainment and CAC intend to cooperate fully with both the FinCEN and grand jury investigations. Based on proceedings to date, we are currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of these matters or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any.\nWe are, or may become involved, in legal proceedings that if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to our business. The nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners, and others in the ordinary course of business. As with all legal proceedings, however, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and in general, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCAC and CGP LLC are defendants in certain legal proceedings, including the lawsuits relating to the Merger Agreement and the proposed Merger, as discussed below in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. If a court were to find in favor of the claimants in these proceedings, such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to CGP LLC\u2019s Interactive Entertainment Business\nOne game has historically generated the majority of CIE's revenue, and CIE must continue to launch and enhance games that attract and retain a significant number of players in order to grow its revenue and sustain its competitive position.\nHistorically, CIE has depended on one game for the majority of its revenue and we expect that this dependency will likely continue for the foreseeable future. Specifically, Slotomania accounted for 51% of CIE's social and mobile online game revenue for 2014 and 47.7% of CIE's total revenue for 2014. CIE's growth depends on its ability to increase interest in its key established game, Slotomania, by continually enhancing the game. Each of CIE's games requires significant engineering, marketing and other resources to develop, launch and sustain via regular upgrades and expansions, and such costs on average have increased and are likely to continue to increase in the future. CIE's ability to successfully launch, sustain and expand games and attract and retain players largely depends on its ability to:\n\u2022\nanticipate and effectively respond to changing player interests and preferences;\n\u2022\nanticipate and respond to changes in the competitive landscape, including any future legalization of online real money gaming in the United States and other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nattract, retain and motivate talented game designers, product managers and engineers;\n\u2022\ndevelop, sustain and expand games that are fun, interesting and compelling to play;\n\u2022\neffectively market new games and enhancements to CIE's existing players and new players;\n\u2022\nminimize launch delays and cost overruns on new games and game expansions;\n\u2022\nminimize downtime and other technical difficulties; and\n\u2022\nacquire high quality assets, personnel and companies.\nIt is difficult to consistently anticipate player demand on a large scale, particularly as CIE develops new games in new markets, including international markets and mobile platforms. If CIE does not successfully launch and/or sustain games that attract and retain a significant number of players and extend the life of CIE's existing games, it could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf CIE's top game, Slotomania, does not maintain its popularity, CIE\u2019s results of operations could be harmed.\nIn addition to creating new games or expanding current games that are attractive to a significant number of players, CIE must extend the life of its existing games, in particular its most successful game, Slotomania. For a game to remain popular, CIE must routinely enhance, expand and/or upgrade the game with new features and content that players find attractive. Such enhancement requires the investment of significant resources, integration into new platforms, introduction of new languages, expansion into new jurisdictions and often presents new marketing and other challenges. CIE may not be able to successfully enhance, expand or upgrade CIE's current library of games. Any decrease in the popularity of CIE's social and mobile games, or any other adverse developments relating to CIE's most popular game, Slotomania, could have a material adverse effect on its, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nCIE relies on a small portion of its total players for nearly all of its revenue from social and mobile games and if CIE fails to grow or sustain its player base, its results of operations could be adversely affected.\nConsistent with the social and mobile games business model, only a small portion of CIE\u2019s social and mobile games players pay for virtual goods. During 2014, CIE\u2019s social and mobile games business had approximately 576 thousand average\nMonthly Unique Payers, or 3.4% of the total number of CIE's average Monthly Unique Users on its social and mobile platforms. In order to sustain and increase CIE's revenue levels, CIE must attract, retain and increase the number of players that are payers. To retain players, CIE must devote significant resources so that the games they play retain their interest and attract them to CIE's other games. If CIE fails to grow or sustain its player base, or if the rates at which CIE attracts and retain players declines or if the average amount of revenue CIE receives from its players declines, it could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe social and mobile games industry is rapidly growing and changing, which makes it difficult to evaluate CIE's business and prospects.\nSocial and mobile games, from which CGP LLC derived 93.6% of the revenue for the Interactive Entertainment business for 2014, is a rapidly growing and evolving industry. The growth of the industries and the level of demand and market acceptance of CIE's games are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. CIE's future operating results will depend on numerous factors affecting the social and mobile games industry, many of which are beyond CIE's control, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe occurrence and manner of legalization of online real money gaming in the United States beyond Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey;\n\u2022\ncontinued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of Facebook, other social networks and mobile platforms;\n\u2022\nchanging rules and requirements on social networks, like Facebook and mobile platforms, like Android and Apple iOS;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n\u2022\nchanging laws and regulations affecting social and mobile games;\n\u2022\nthe availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment;\n\u2022\nthe worldwide growth of personal computer, broadband Internet and mobile device users, and the rate of any such growth; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary consumer spending.\nCIE's ability to plan for game development, distribution and promotional activities will be significantly affected by its ability to anticipate and adapt to relatively rapid changes in the tastes and preferences of its current and potential players. New and different types of entertainment may increase in popularity at the expense of social and mobile games. A decline in the popularity of social or mobile games in general, or CIE's games in particular, could have a material adverse effect on its, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nCIE has a new business model and a short operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects and future financial results and may increase the risk that it will not be successful.\nCIE's business was formed in May 2009, and CIE's business changed significantly with the acquisition of Playtika in 2011. Consequently, CIE has a short operating history and a new business model, both of which make it difficult to effectively assess its future prospects. Today, CIE\u2019s business model is largely based on offering games that are free to play on social and mobile platforms, regulated online real money gaming in Nevada and New Jersey and its WSOP sponsorship and licensing businesses. However, we expect CIE's business model to evolve as other states legalize online poker or online gambling. Moreover, to date, CIE's social and mobile games business only earns revenue from a small portion of its players. In addition, CIE's experience in the complex business of online real money gaming is limited. CIE's future prospects are particularly difficult to assess because it has derived the majority of its historical revenue from its acquisition of Playtika in 2011. You should consider CIE's business and prospects in light of the challenges it faces, any one, or the combination, of which could have material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe low barriers to entry and intense competition that characterizes the social and mobile games industry could have an adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business financial condition and results of operations.\nThe social and mobile games industry has low barriers to entry and we expect more companies to enter the sector and a wider range of social and mobile games to be introduced. The industry is also highly competitive. CIE's competitors that develop social and mobile games vary in size and include publicly traded companies such as Zynga Inc. (\"Zynga\"), Glu Mobile, Gtech, King Entertainment and Electronic Arts. In addition, online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets, such as Tencent Holdings Limited in Asia, and high-profile companies with significant online presences that to date have not developed social and mobile games, such as Amazon.com, Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook, Google Inc. (\"Google\"), Microsoft and Yahoo! Inc., may decide to develop social and mobile games in the future. Some of these current and potential competitors have significant resources for developing or acquiring additional games, may be able to incorporate their own highly recognized brands and assets into their games, have a more diversified set of revenue sources than CIE currently does and may be less severely affected by changes in consumer preferences, regulations or other developments that\nmay impact the social and mobile games industry. As CIE continues to devote significant resources to developing games for social and mobile platforms, CIE will face significant competition from established companies that may have far greater experience than CIE, including Zynga and Electronic Arts. Moreover, there exists in the social and mobile games industry a significant \"first mover\" advantage. CIE's ability to compete effectively in respect to a particular style of game may be premised on introducing a game in that style before CIE's competitors. We cannot assure you that CIE will be able to continue to compete effectively or that CIE will be capable of maintaining or further increasing its current market share. CIE's failure to compete successfully in its various markets could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf CIE fails to effectively manage its growth, CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business and operating results could be harmed.\nCIE continues to experience rapid growth in its headcount and operations, which will continue to place significant demands on its management and operational, financial and technological infrastructure. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 35% of CIE's employees had been with CIE for less than one year and approximately 62% for less than two years. Moreover, a number of the individuals CIE relies on for its operations are consultants, not full-time employees on CIE's payroll. As CIE continues to grow, it must expend significant resources to identify, hire, integrate, develop and motivate a large number of qualified employees. If CIE fails to effectively manage its hiring needs and successfully integrate its new hires, CIE's ability to continue launching new games and enhance existing games could suffer.\nTo effectively manage the growth of CIE's business and operations, it will need to continue spending significant resources to improve its technology infrastructure, its operational, financial and management controls, and its reporting systems and procedures by, among other things:\n\u2022\nmonitoring and updating CIE's technology infrastructure to maintain high performance and minimize down time;\n\u2022\nenhancing information and communication systems to ensure that CIE's employees and offices around the world are well-coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other; and\n\u2022\nappropriately documenting CIE's information technology systems and business processes.\nIf CIE fails to successfully do these things, it could have a material adverse effect on its, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nCIE's growth prospects will suffer if it is unable to develop successful games for new and emerging platforms.\nWe expect CIE to devote substantial resources to the development of its social online and mobile games on new and emerging platforms, and its limited experience makes it difficult to know whether CIE will succeed in developing such games that appeal to players or advertisers on such new and emerging platforms. The uncertainties CIE faces include:\n\u2022\nits experience in developing social games for use primarily on Facebook, Google\u2019s Android and Apple\u2019s iOS may not be relevant for developing games for new and emerging platforms;\n\u2022\nmany new and emerging platforms are located in countries where CIE has no or limited operating experience;\n\u2022\nnew and emerging platforms may require different technological requirements to adapt CIE's games than its current platforms, which may require significant expense;\n\u2022\nCIE has limited experience working with wireless carriers, new and emerging platform providers and other partners whose cooperation CIE may need in order to be successful; and\n\u2022\nCIE will need to move beyond payment methods provided by social networks and successfully allow for a variety of payment methods and systems based on new mobile platforms, geographies and other factors.\nThese and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether CIE will succeed in developing commercially viable games for new and emerging social and mobile platforms. If CIE does not succeed in doing so, it could have a material adverse effect on its, therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf CIE is unable to maintain a good relationship with Facebook, Apple and/or Google, or if Facebook, Apple or Google were to change their respective terms of service in ways unfavorable to CIE, CIE's business may suffer.\nFacebook, Apple iOS and Google Android are significant distribution, marketing, promotion and payment platforms for CIE's games. In 2014, CIE generated approximately 95.6% of its social and mobile games revenue and 91.8% of its social and mobile games users through the Facebook, Apple iOS and Google Android platforms and we expect CIE to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. CIE is subject to Facebook's, Apple's and Google's respective standard terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of games and other applications on the Facebook, Apple iOS and Android platforms.\nCIE has benefited from Facebook's, Apple's and Google's strong brand recognition and large user bases. If Facebook, Apple iOS and/or Google loses its market position or otherwise falls out of favor with Internet users, CIE would need to identify alternative channels for marketing, promoting and distributing CIE's social and mobile games, which would consume substantial resources and may not be effective. In addition, Facebook, Apple and Google each have broad discretion to change their respective terms of service and other policies, without CIE's consent and without notice, with respect to CIE and other developers, and those changes may be unfavorable to CIE. Facebook, Apple and/or Google may also change their respective fee structures, add fees associated with access to and use of the Facebook, Apple iOS and Android platforms, change how the personal information of their respective users is made available to application developers on the Facebook, Apple iOS or Android platforms, restrict how Facebook, Apple iOS or Android users can share information with friends on their respective platforms, restrict or discontinue access for consumers from certain countries, discontinue or limit access to their respective platforms by CIE and other game developers or develop their own competitive offerings. If any of these events were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe loss of the services of key personnel at CIE could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nThe leadership of CIE's chief executive officer, Mitch Garber, and other executive officers has been a critical element of its success. The death or disability of Mitch Garber or other extended or permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, therefore CGP LLC\u2019s, business. CIE's other executive officers and other members of senior management, including Robert Antokol, co-founder of Playtika, have substantial experience and expertise in the social and mobile games industry and have made significant contributions to CIE's growth and success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results. CIE is not protected by key man or similar life insurance covering members of its senior management. CIE has employment agreements with certain of its executive officers, but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with CIE.\nIf CIE is unable to attract, retain and motivate employees, it may not be able to compete effectively and may not be able to successfully expand its businesses.\nCIE's success and ability to grow are dependent, in part, on its ability to hire, retain and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people, with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve and expand its business. Such employees, particularly game designers, product managers and engineers, are in high demand, and CIE devotes significant resources to identifying, hiring, training, integrating and retaining these employees. These efforts place significant demands on CIE's resources. Historically, CIE has hired a number of key personnel through strategic acquisitions, such as our acquisition of Playtika, and as competition with other social and mobile games companies increases, CIE may incur significant expenses in continuing this practice. The inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of a significant number of CIE's employees could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, therefore CGP LLC\u2019s, business, financial condition and operating results.\nExpansion into international markets is important for CIE's growth, and as CIE expands internationally it faces additional business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks, any of which could increase its costs and hinder its growth.\nContinuing to expand CIE's business to attract players in countries other than the United States is a critical element of CIE's business strategy. An important part of targeting international markets is developing offerings that have localized content and are customized for the players in those markets. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to international expansion through acquisitions, the establishment of additional offices and development studios, and increasing CIE's foreign language strategic offerings. CIE's ability to expand its business and to attract talented employees and players in an increasing number of international markets requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. Expanding CIE's international focus may subject it to risks that it has not faced before or increase risks that CIE currently faces, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable management and employees in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nchallenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and customizing games and other offerings that appeal to the tastes and preferences of players in international markets;\n\u2022\ncompetition from local game makers with significant market share in those markets and with a better understanding of local player preferences;\n\u2022\nprotecting and enforcing CIE's intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nnegotiating agreements with local distribution platforms that are economically beneficial to CIE and protective of its rights;\n\u2022\nthe inability to extend proprietary rights in CIE's brand, content or technology into new jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nimplementing alternative payment methods for virtual goods in a manner that complies with local laws and practices and protects CIE from fraud;\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, including privacy laws and laws relating to content;\n\u2022\ncompliance with anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, compliance with the FCPA;\n\u2022\ncredit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nprotectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in some countries;\n\u2022\nforeign tax consequences, including the requirement to pay value added tax, or VAT, in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls or U.S. tax restrictions that might restrict or prevent CIE from repatriating income earned in countries outside the United States; and\n\u2022\npolitical, economic and social instability.\nEntering new international markets can be expensive, CIE's ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any particular market is uncertain and the distraction of CIE's senior management team could mean that it is unable to capitalize on other strategic opportunities. If CIE is unable to successfully expand into new international markets, it could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe value of CIE's virtual goods is highly dependent on how CIE manages the economies in its games. If CIE fails to manage its game economies properly, its business may suffer.\nPlayers from whom CIE derives revenue purchase virtual goods in CIE's games because of the perceived value of these goods, which is dependent on the relative ease of securing an equivalent good via non-paid means within the game. The perceived value of these virtual goods can be impacted by various actions that CIE takes in the games, including offering discounts for virtual goods, giving away virtual goods in promotions or providing easier non-paid means to secure these goods. If CIE fails to manage its virtual economies properly, players may be less likely to purchase virtual goods, which could have a material adverse effect on its, and therefore CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe proliferation of hacking, security breaches, computer malware, \u201ccheating\u201d programs and scam offers that seek to exploit CIE's games and players affects the game-playing experience and may lead players to stop playing CIE's games.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in CIE's industry and may occur on its systems in the future. Because of CIE\u2019s prominence in the social and mobile game industry, CIE's affiliation with one of the largest gaming entertainment companies in the world, and because of the prominence of the brands CIE uses in its businesses, including Caesars, WSOP, Slotomania and Bingo Blitz, we believe CIE is a particularly attractive target for hackers. Though it is difficult to determine what harm may exactly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of CIE's network infrastructure to the satisfaction of its players may harm CIE's reputation and its ability to retain existing players and attract new players. CIE is particularly exposed to these risks in its online real money gaming business where players place an especially high value on the proper functioning of CIE's games. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nUnrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to develop, \"cheating\" programs and activities that enable players to exploit CIE's games, play them in an automated way or obtain unfair advantages over other players who do play fairly, including through the unauthorized sale of CIE\u2019s virtual goods. These programs and activities harm the experience of players who play fairly and may disrupt the real money operations and virtual economies of CIE's games. CIE devotes significant resources to discover and disable these programs and activities, but if CIE is unable to do so quickly its operations may be disrupted, its reputation damaged and players may stop playing its games. This may lead to lost revenue from paying players, increased cost of developing technological measures to combat these programs and activities, legal claims relating to the diminution in value of CIE's real money gaming credits, virtual currency and increased customer service costs needed to respond to dissatisfied players.\nCIE is subject to payment-related risks, such as risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, which could have adverse effects on CIE's business or results of operations due to unusually large or frequent chargebacks from customers.\nCIE accepts payments using a variety of methods, including PayPal, credit and debit cards. As CIE continues to introduce new payment options to its players, CIE may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements. CIE also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other payment options. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, CIE pays interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability. CIE relies on third parties to provide payment processing services and it could disrupt CIE\u2019s business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to CIE. CIE is also subject to rules and requirements governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for CIE to comply. If CIE fails to comply with these rules or requirements, CIE may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose its ability to accept PayPal, credit card, debit card, or other payments from consumers which could have a material adverse effect on its, and therefore CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, depending on the merchant category code assigned to CIE by the credit card associations, especially for its online real money gaming business, CIE may be subject to a higher percentage of declined transactions which could reduce the amount of money deposited.\nChargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions. Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided. In CIE\u2019s business, players occasionally seek to reverse their online real money gaming losses or purchases of virtual goods through chargebacks. Although CIE places great emphasis on control procedures to protect from chargebacks, these control procedures may not be sufficient to protect CIE from adverse effects on its business or results of operations due to unusually large or frequent chargebacks.\nProgramming errors or flaws in CIE's social and mobile games, or on its regulated online real money gaming websites, could harm CIE's reputation or decrease market acceptance of CIE's games, which could have a material adverse effect on its, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nCIE\u2019s social and mobile games, and its regulated online real money gaming websites, may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data, and these defects may only become apparent after their launch, particularly as CIE launches new games and rapidly launches new features to existing games under tight time constraints. We believe that if CIE's players have a negative experience with its games, they may be less inclined to continue or resume playing CIE's games or recommend its games to other potential players. Undetected programming errors, game defects and data corruption can disrupt CIE's operations, adversely affect the game experience of CIE's players by allowing players to gain unfair advantage, harm CIE\u2019s reputation, cause CIE's players to stop playing its games, divert CIE's resources and delay market acceptance of CIE's games, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nCompanies and governmental agencies may restrict access to Facebook, CIE's websites or the Internet generally, which could lead to the loss or slower growth of CIE's player base.\nCIE's online players need to access the Internet to play CIE's games. Companies and governmental agencies could block access to the Internet generally or the particular platform on which a player wishes to play CIE's games (e.g., Facebook) for a number of reasons such as security or confidentiality concerns or regulatory reasons, or they may adopt policies that prohibit employees from accessing Facebook, CIE's website, CIE's online gaming websites or other social platforms for work related efficiency reasons. For example, the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China has blocked access to Facebook in China and, according to an article in The Wall Street Journal, Proctor & Gamble recently implemented a policy restricting employee access to a number of popular entertainment websites. If companies or governmental entities block or limit access to Facebook, CIE's website, CIE's online gaming websites or otherwise adopt policies restricting players from playing CIE's games, it could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nEvolving regulations concerning data privacy may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could prevent CIE from providing its current games to its players or require CIE to modify its games, thereby harming its business.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the Internet and mobile platforms have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. In addition, the European Union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies with users in Europe. Various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices.\nCIE's business, including its ability to operate and expand internationally, could be adversely affected if laws or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with CIE's current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of CIE's website, games, features or its privacy policy. In particular, the success of CIE's business has been, and we expect will continue to be, driven by CIE's ability to responsibly use the data that CIE's players share with it. Therefore, CIE's business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the use or disclosure of data CIE's players choose to share with it, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such use and disclosure is obtained. Such changes may require CIE to modify its games and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit CIE's ability to develop new games and features that make use of the data that CIE's players voluntarily share with it.\nCIE's business is subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject CIE to claims or otherwise harm its business.\nIt is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to CIE in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the social and mobile industry, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution and antitrust. For example, certain jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere may deem CIE's social and mobile games to be gambling or marketing gambling to underage persons and therefore in violation of the laws of such jurisdictions. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as CIE conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of CIE's industry will increase and that CIE will be required to devote legal and other resources to address such regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and banking institutions may be interpreted to cover real money gaming credits, virtual currency or virtual goods. If that were to occur CIE may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on CIE meeting certain capital and other requirements and CIE may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase CIE\u2019s operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of social or mobile games or online real money gaming services and impair CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAny failure to protect CIE's trademarks or other intellectual property could have a negative impact on the value of CIE's brand names and adversely affect its business.\nThe development of intellectual property is part of CIE\u2019s overall business strategy and CIE regards its intellectual property to be an important element of its success. For example, CIE owns the WSOP brand and intellectual property, and CIE licenses or sublicenses trademarks for a variety of products and businesses related to this brand. CIE also owns the Slotomania brand. CIE seeks to establish and maintain its proprietary rights in its business operations and technology through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws. CIE files applications for and obtains copyrights and trademarks in the United States and in foreign countries where CIE believes filing for such protection is appropriate. CIE also seeks to maintain its trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. Despite CIE's efforts to protect its proprietary rights, parties may infringe its copyrights and trademarks and use information that CIE regards as proprietary and CIE\u2019s rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. In addition, parties may challenge CIE's copyright or trademark applications in the United States or other jurisdictions. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Monitoring the unauthorized use of CIE's intellectual property is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce CIE's intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of CIE's resources. The unauthorized use or reproduction of CIE's trademarks could diminish the value of its brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the future, it is possible that CIE will face allegations that it has infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from its competitors, non-practicing entities and former employers of its personnel. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. As the result of any court judgment or settlement, CIE may be obligated to cancel the launch of a new game, stop offering certain features, pay royalties or significant settlement costs, purchase licenses or modify its games and features while it develops substitutes.\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \"Leahy-Smith Act\"), was adopted in September 2011. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act did not become effective until up to 18 months after its enactment. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of CIE's business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and\nits implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of CIE's patent applications and the enforcement or defense of its issued patents, all of which could harm its business.\nCIE's business strategy is premised, in part, on the legalization of online real money gaming in the United States and its ability to predict and capitalize on any such legalization.\nIn the last few years, California, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Mississippi, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Iowa, Illinois, Washington D.C. and the Federal government have considered legislation that would legalize online real money gaming. To date, only Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey have enacted such legislation. If a large number of additional states or the Federal government fail to enact online real money gaming legislation or CIE is unable to obtain the necessary licenses to operate online real money gaming websites in United States jurisdictions where such games are legalized, CIE's future growth could be materially impaired as CIE would be limited to offering online real money gaming to players in jurisdictions outside the United States where legal. Moreover, there were bills introduced in Congress in 2014 that would ban online gaming in the United States. In addition, states or the Federal government may legalize online real money gaming in a manner that is unfavorable to CIE. For example, several states and the Federal government are considering draft laws that require online casinos to also have a license to operate a brick-and-mortar casino, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate. If, like Nevada and New Jersey, U.S. jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing real money casino gaming subject to this brick-and-mortar requirement, CIE may be unable to offer online real money gaming in such jurisdictions if CIE is unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction. If, however, legislation is enacted legalizing real money casino gaming without this requirement, CIE would lose its advantage over some of its potential competitors that do not have an affiliate with a brick-and-mortar casino operation. The loss of this or other similar advantages CIE receives as an affiliate of Caesars Entertainment, or the passage of a federal law banning online gaming in the United States could materially impair its ability to grow its online real money gaming business in the future.\nThere also exists in the online real money gaming industry a significant \"first mover\" advantage. CIE's ability to compete effectively in respect of a particular style of online real money gaming in the United States may be premised on introducing a style of gaming before its competitors. CIE's failure to do so could materially impair its ability to grow its online real money gaming business in the future.\nIn addition to the risk that online real money gaming will be legalized in a manner unfavorable to CIE, CIE may fail to accurately predict when online real money gaming will be legalized in significant jurisdictions. The legislative process in each U.S. state and at the Federal level is unique and capable of rapid, often unpredictable change. If CIE fails to accurately forecast when and how, if at all, online real money gaming will be legalized in additional U.S. jurisdictions, such failure could impair CIE's readiness to introduce online real money gaming offerings in such jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nNevada, Delaware and New Jersey are the only U.S. jurisdictions that have affirmatively legalized online real money gaming and are small jurisdictions that may not yield significant revenue.\nNevada, Delaware and New Jersey are the only U.S. jurisdictions that have enacted legislation legalizing online real money gaming. Both Nevada and Delaware are relatively small jurisdictions in terms of population compared to the rest of the United States and there may be significant competition for online real money gaming in these jurisdictions, and as a result, CIE may not be able to obtain a significant amount of revenue in these jurisdictions.\nIndividuals may seek to participate in online real money gaming in jurisdictions where it is illegal. If CIE is unsuccessful in blocking such individuals, CIE may suffer legal penalties or an impairment of its ability to offer online real money gaming in general.\nIndividuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal may nonetheless seek to engage CIE's online real money gaming offerings. While CIE will take steps to block access by individuals in such jurisdictions, those steps may be unsuccessful. In the event that individuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal engage CIE's online real money gaming offerings, CIE may be subject to criminal sanctions, regulatory penalties, the loss of existing or future licenses necessary to offer online real money gaming or other legal liabilities, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results. For example, gambling laws and regulations in many jurisdictions require gaming industry participants to maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations. If CIE is unsuccessful in blocking access to its online real money gaming offerings by individuals in a jurisdiction where such offerings are illegal, CIE could lose or be prevented from obtaining a license necessary to offer online real money gaming in a jurisdiction in which such offerings are legal and CGP LLC's other gaming licenses may be materially impacted.\nSocial and mobile games may become subject to regulation or prohibition in certain jurisdictions, which could increase CIE's compliance costs or limit the number of jurisdictions in which CIE is able to offer social and mobile games.\nCertain jurisdictions may seek to regulate or ban social and mobile games. For example, the UK Gambling Commission publicly indicated that it will consider whether to regulate social and mobile games in the future after considering the issues of\nconsumer protection. Under recent proposed legislation in Australia, certain online social games with a paid-for element would fall under the Interactive Gambling Act, and by being considered gambling would be at risk of outright ban. Thus far, in considering whether regulation or restriction is necessary, most jurisdictions have been interested in understanding the games and whether they constitute gambling under their laws or otherwise require regulation to protect the consumer. If the UK, Australia, or another jurisdiction important to CIE's social and mobile games business bans, regulates or restricts the business, it could have material impacts on how we market our product, on the cost associated with compliance with such regulation or, depending on the nature of the regulation, CIE could be prohibited from providing social and mobile games, all of which could have material adverse impacts on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nCIE is dependent on a small number of third parties for its online real money gaming platforms.\nCIE contracts with a small number of third-party partners to develop, launch, maintain and operate its software platforms for online real money gaming, including its relationship with 888 and Nyx Gaming. In addition, CIE enters into license agreements and pays license fees for certain intellectual property rights for the development, launch, maintenance and operation of CIE's real money gaming services. If, in the future, these third parties choose not to provide such services or licenses to CIE on terms acceptable to it, CIE will have to seek alternative means of securing comparable services or licenses, which may be on terms that are not as favorable as the current terms. With respect to CIE's platforms for online real money gaming, the termination of these services or licenses by any of these third parties could delay the launch of CIE's real money online poker operations in the United States if such operations are legalized. For example, if CIE's agreement with 888 related to online gaming services in the United States were to be breached, CIE would not be able to offer online poker in Nevada and/or New Jersey. The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nRecent changes in U.S. tax laws, the enactment of future legislation implementing changes in the U.S. taxation of international business activities, a change in the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact CIE's financial position and results of operations.\nRecent changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of CIE\u2019s foreign earnings. The Obama administration has made public statements indicating that it has made international tax reform a priority, and key members of the U.S. Congress have conducted hearings and proposed legislation in the past that addresses several international tax issues. Due to the large and expanding scale of CIE's international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase CIE's worldwide effective tax rate and harm CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, financial position and results of operations. Additionally, any increase or changes in taxes in other countries where CIE has significant operations, such as Israel, could harm CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, financial position and results of operations.\nMoreover, CIE's corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which CIE develops and uses its intellectual property and the transfer pricing of its intercompany transactions, are intended to provide CIE worldwide tax efficiencies. The application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States, to CIE\u2019s international business activities is subject to interpretation and depends on CIE\u2019s ability to operate its business in a manner consistent with its corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which CIE operates may challenge CIE\u2019s methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including CIE\u2019s transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which CIE operates its business is not consistent with the manner in which CIE reports its income to the jurisdictions, which could increase CIE\u2019s worldwide effective tax rate and harm its, and therefore CGP LLC's, financial position and results of operations.\nCIE is no longer a member of Caesars Entertainment's consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which will trigger intercompany gains between CIE and Caesars Entertainment or other members of Caesars Entertainment's consolidated group. CIE could be liable for taxes owed by Caesars Entertainment for periods prior to the date CIE became deconsolidated including with respect to the intercompany gains.\nCaesars Entertainment no longer owns 80% or more of the common stock of CIE, and therefore, under U.S. federal income tax laws, CIE ceased to be a member of Caesars Entertainment\u2019s consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The triggering of deferred intercompany gains between CIE and Caesars Entertainment or other members of Caesars Entertainment\u2019s consolidated group resulted in the realization of a gain for Caesars Entertainment with respect to the WSOP assets that CIE acquired from CEOC and its subsidiaries.\nAfter its deconsolidation from Caesars Entertainment\u2019s consolidated group, CIE is the parent of a new consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Pursuant to the terms of the tax matters agreement between CIE and Caesars Entertainment (the \"Tax Matters Agreement\"), however, CIE may be required to make payments to Caesars Entertainment in respect of taxes owed by Caesars Entertainment for periods prior to the date CIE became deconsolidated. In addition, under U.S. federal income tax laws, each member of a consolidated group is liable for the consolidated group\u2019s entire tax obligation.\nTherefore, to the extent that Caesars Entertainment, or other members of Caesars Entertainment\u2019s consolidated group, fail to make any U.S. federal income tax payments required by law attributable to periods during which CIE was a member of Caesars Entertainment\u2019s consolidated group, CIE could be liable for the shortfall. Similar principles may apply for foreign, state or local income tax purposes where CIE filed combined, consolidated or unitary returns with Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries for foreign, state or local income tax purposes.\nRisks Related to CGP LLC's Casino Properties and Developments Business\nCGP LLC's Casino Properties and Developments business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending resulting from downturns in the economy, the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, adverse changes in the global economy and other factors which could negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to access financing.\nChanges in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences are driven by factors beyond CGP LLC's control, such as perceived or actual general economic conditions; high energy, fuel and other commodity costs; the cost of travel; the potential for bank failures; a soft job market; an actual or perceived decrease in disposable consumer income and wealth; fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy; and terrorist attacks or other global events. CGP LLC's Casino Properties and Developments business is particularly susceptible to any such changes because CGP LLC\u2019s casino properties offers a highly discretionary set of entertainment and leisure activities and amenities. If discretionary consumer spending declines, then CGP LLC's results of operations will be adversely impacted.\nThe continuing economic downturn and adverse conditions in the local, regional, national and global markets have negatively affected CGP LLC and may continue to negatively affect CGP LLC in the future. During periods of economic contraction, CGP LLC's revenues may decrease while some of its costs remain fixed or even increase, resulting in decreased earnings. In addition, CGP LLC may also be unable to find additional cost savings to offset any decrease in revenues. Even an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer spending in CGP LLC's gaming operations and related facilities, as consumers spend less in anticipation of a potential economic downturn.\nTheoretical win rates for CGP LLC's casino operations depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond its control.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. Accordingly, CGP LLC\u2019s casino properties employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of game, on average, will win or lose in the long run. In addition to the element of chance, theoretical win rates are also affected by the spread of table limits and factors that are beyond CGP LLC's control, such as a player\u2019s skill and experience and behavior, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time players spend gambling. As a result of the variability in these factors, the actual win rates at the casino may differ from the theoretical win rates and could result in the winnings of CGP LLC's gaming customers exceeding those anticipated. The variability of these factors, alone or in combination, have the potential to negatively impact our actual win rates, which may adversely affect CGP LLC's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCGP LLC's casino operations extend credit to its customers and may not be able to collect gaming receivables from its credit players.\nCGP LLC\u2019s casino properties conduct their gaming activities on a credit basis as well as a cash basis, which credit is unsecured. Table games players typically are extended more credit than slot players, and high stakes players are typically extended more credit than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter.\nCGP LLC\u2019s casino properties extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible. While gaming debts are evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a \"marker,\" and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis and judgments in such jurisdictions on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.\nWe face the risk of fraud and cheating.\nCasino gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or cheat in order to increase winnings. Acts of fraud or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with the employees of CGP LLC's casinos. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers\nor other casino or gaming area staff. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in gaming operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on CGP LLC's reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on CGP LLCs business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete against our competitors, our profits will decline.\nThe gaming industry is highly competitive and CGP LLC's competitors vary considerably in size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, and geographic diversity. CGP LLC also competes with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, and with various other entertainment businesses. Competitors in each market that we participate may have greater financial, marketing, or other resources than CGP LLC do, and there can be no assurance that they will not engage in aggressive pricing action to compete with CGP LLC. Although we believe CGP LLC is currently able to compete effectively in each of the various markets in which we participate, we cannot ensure that CGP LLC will be able to continue to do so or that they will be capable of maintaining or further increasing their current market share. CGP LLC's failure to compete successfully in their various markets could adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nIn recent years, many casino operators have been reinvesting in existing markets to attract new customers or to gain market share, thereby increasing competition in those markets. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some markets, including Las Vegas, CGP LLC's largest market, and competition has increased significantly. For example, SLS Las Vegas opened in August 2014 on the northern end of the Strip, and the Genting Group has announced plans to develop a casino and hotel called Resorts World Las Vegas, which is expected to open in 2017 on the northern end of the Strip. Also, in response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. MGM has announced plans for The Park, which includes a new retail and dining development on the land between New York-New York and Monte Carlo, a renovation of the Strip-front facades of both resorts and a new 20,000 seat indoor arena for sporting events and concerts operated by AEG. Construction of The Park and the arena is expected to be complete in 2016. There have also been proposals for other large scale non-gaming development projects in Las Vegas by various other developers, however, there are no details as to when or if these projects will be completed. The expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of CGP LLC's competitors have increased competition in many markets in which they operate, and this intense competition is expected to continue. These competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect CGP LLC's financial performance.\nIn addition, in the mid-Atlantic region, existing casino resorts provide a number of gaming options for customers, thereby creating significant competition for Horseshoe Baltimore. The casino resorts in the mid-Atlantic region compete with each other on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment offered and size. Further, the casino resort that will open with the sixth license in Prince George\u2019s County granted by the State of Maryland may draw additional customers away from Horseshoe Baltimore. If Horseshoe Baltimore is unable to effectively compete with other regional casino resorts or keep customers, this inability may negatively affect Horseshoe Baltimore\u2019s, and therefore CGP LLC's, business and operations.\nCGP LLC's Casino Properties and Developments Business may be subject to material environmental liability, including as a result of unknown environmental contamination.\nThe Casino Properties and Developments Business is subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as emissions to air, discharges to streams and rivers and releases of hazardous substances and pollutants into the environment, as well as handling and disposal from municipal/non-hazardous waste, and which also apply to current and previous owners or operators of real estate generally. Federal examples of these laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Certain of these environmental laws may impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused particular contamination or release of hazardous substances. Should unknown contamination be discovered on CGP LLC's property, or should a release of hazardous substances occur on CGP LLC's property, CGP LLC could be required to investigate and clean up the contamination and could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury or investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination or release, which may be substantial. Moreover, such contamination may also impair CGP LLC's ability to use the affected property. Such liability could be joint and several in nature, regardless of fault, and could affect CGP LLC even if such property is vacated. The potential for substantial costs and an inability to use the property could adversely affect our business.\nCGP LLC's insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses it could suffer, and, in the future, its insurance costs may increase significantly or it may be unable to obtain the same level of insurance coverage.\nCGP LLC\u2019s casino properties may suffer damage to its property caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters and acts of war or terrorism) that could severely disrupt its business or subject it to claims by third parties who are injured or harmed. Although CGP LLC maintains insurance (including property, casualty, terrorism and business interruption insurance), that insurance may be inadequate or unavailable to cover all of the risks to which its business and assets may be exposed. Should an uninsured loss or loss in excess of insured limits occur, it could have a significant adverse impact on CGP LLC\u2019s operations and revenues.\nCGP LLC renews its insurance policies on an annual basis. If the cost of coverage becomes too high, CGP LLC may need to reduce its policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from its coverage in order to reduce the premiums to an acceptable amount. Among other factors, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in the current U.S. statutory requirement that insurance carriers offer coverage for certain acts of terrorism could adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause CGP LLC to elect to reduce its policy limits) and additional exclusions from coverage. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future CGP LLC may elect to not, or may be unable to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.\nPlanet Hollywood licenses the Planet Hollywood brand from affiliates of Robert Earl and there can be no assurances that the Planet Hollywood brand would not be negatively impacted by its use outside of our control.\nAffiliates of Robert Earl license certain intellectual property relating to the operation of the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino to Planet Hollywood. The license includes certain names and trademarks and the right to display certain memorabilia on the Planet Hollywood premises. Planet Hollywood has invested significant time and financing to establish its brand as a Hollywood-themed entertainment and non-gaming destination. The expiration or termination, or modification of the terms of this license may have a materially adverse effect on Planet Hollywood\u2019s, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial conditions and operating results.\nIn addition, the Planet Hollywood brand is used by affiliates of Robert Earl in Hollywood-themed restaurants, hotels and shops around the United States and internationally. Any negative events associated with the use of the Planet Hollywood brand with these restaurants and shops may be out of CGP LLC's control, and may negatively impact the brand\u2019s image for the Planet Hollywood casino, which could harm Planet Hollywood\u2019s, therefore CGP LLC's, business and results of operations.\nThe Maryland Joint Venture adds additional risk that may result in a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nCGP LLC indirectly holds approximately 40.9% interest in the Maryland Joint Venture. While CGP LLC can influence the ownership of the Maryland Joint Venture through its equity ownership, CGP LLC relies on the other equity partners for providing certain funding for the Maryland Joint Venture and there can be no assurances that the other equity partners will provide sufficient funding, or any funding at all, if needed. The failure of other equity partners in the Maryland Joint Venture to provide the appropriate level of funding may result in a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nCaesars Entertainment's call right on our Class A common stock may result in you being forced to sell our Class A common stock at a disadvantageous time and will cause you to own stock of Caesars Entertainment. This call right may not occur at all due to the discretion of Caesars Entertainment or the inability of Caesars Entertainment to meet the conditions required to exercise such right.\nAfter October 21, 2016, Caesars Entertainment will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to any transferee of all non-voting units of CGP LLC held by Caesars Entertainment, to acquire all or a portion of the voting units of CGP LLC (or, at our option, shares of CAC\u2019s Class A common stock) not otherwise owned by Caesars Entertainment at such time. As a result, you may be forced to sell your shares of CAC\u2019s Class A common stock on little notice and at a value that may cause you to realize a loss. The exercise of this right by Caesars Entertainment will result in you receiving consideration entirely or partly in the form of stock of Caesars Entertainment, which may be a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes in certain circumstances. If the exchange is not a tax-free reorganization, you may recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on such exchange depending on the amount of cash and the value of the stock of Caesars Entertainment you receive in such exchange and the adjusted tax basis of your shares of CAC\u2019s Class A common stock. There can be no assurances that the stock of Caesars Entertainment will maintain its value from the time of Caesars Entertainment\u2019s exercise of the call right or be part of an active trading market. As a consequence, you may be forced to dispose of the stock of Caesars Entertainment at a great loss.\nIn addition, Caesars Entertainment may exercise the call right in its sole discretion, subject to meeting certain conditions, or Caesars Entertainment may decide to not exercise the call right for any reason whatsoever. Moreover, if Caesars Entertainment does not meet certain liquidity requirements, debt leverage ratio and other requirements, it will be unable to exercise the call right. The uncertainty as to the timing of the exercise of the call right, if at all, by Caesars Entertainment may adversely affect the trading value of our stock. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, and Director Independence.\nCGP LLC is required to be liquidated on April 21, 2022, which may result in you receiving less than the full value of your Class A common stock.\nFollowing October 21, 2018 and until April 21, 2022, our Board will have the right to cause a liquidation of CGP LLC, including the sale or winding up of CGP LLC or other monetization of all of its assets. On April 21, 2022 (unless otherwise agreed by Caesars Entertainment and CAC), if our Board has not previously exercised its liquidation right, CGP LLC shall, and our Board shall cause CGP LLC to, effect a liquidation. Because the liquidation will occur on a set schedule, it is possible that regulations or market factors at the time of liquidation may impede the ability to liquidate the assets of CGP LLC. If CGP LLC is unable to liquidate portions of its assets, proceeds from the liquidation will be negatively impacted. Moreover, the forced liquidation does not preserve the flexibility to maximize the value of CGP LLC\u2019s assets in a sale by waiting for an advantageous time. In addition, CAC\u2019s allocable portion of the gain (if any) on the liquidation of the assets of CGP LLC will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rate. As a result, you may receive less than the full value of your Class A common stock should liquidation occur on April 21, 2022.\nAn active trading market for our Class A common stock may not develop.\nPrior to the closing of the Rights Offering and our listing on the NASDAQ Global Select market on November 19, 2013, there had not been a public market for our Class A common stock. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active trading market or how liquid that market might become. The Sponsors own approximately 66.0% of our Class A common stock and while the shares are eligible for resale, currently such shares are not available for the public market. As a result, our shares may be less liquid than the shares of other newly public companies or other public companies generally and there may be imbalances between supply and demand for our shares. As a result our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance. If an active trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling any of our common stock that you buy. Consequently, you may not be able to sell our Class A common stock at prices equal to or greater than the price you paid.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our Class A common stock may depress the price of shares of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nAll of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock are eligible for resale under Rule 144 or Rule 701 of the Securities Act, subject to volume limitations, applicable holding period requirements and the lock-up agreements or other contractual restrictions related to certain of our stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or other securities or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our Class A common stock or other securities, including future sales by Caesars Entertainment, will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock (including shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.\nThe price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Volatility in the market price of our Class A common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares of Class A common stock. The market price for our Class A common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nconditions that impact demand for the products and services of CGP LLC's businesses;\n\u2022\nthe public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in government and environmental regulation, including gaming taxes;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\narrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe small percentage of our shares that are publicly traded;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure;\n\u2022\nincreases in market interests rates that would decrease the value of CGP LLC's fixed-rate securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the stock price of, or a restructuring of, Caesars Entertainment;\n\u2022\nsales of Class A common stock by us or affiliates of the Sponsors;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of contractual lock-up agreements; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the gaming, lodging, hospitality and entertainment industries. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our Class A common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nHamlet Holdings controls us and their interests may conflict with or differ from your interests as a stockholder.\nHamlet Holdings beneficially owns approximately 66.0% of our Class A common stock. Hamlet Holdings has the power to control our Board. Moreover, Hamlet Holdings has the ability to vote on any transaction that requires the approval of our Board or our stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers and the sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, Hamlet Holdings, the members of which are comprised of three individuals affiliated with Apollo and two individuals affiliated with TPG, as of the date hereof beneficially owns approximately 61% of Caesars Entertainment\u2019s common stock and controls Caesars Entertainment. As a result, even though an independent committee of the Board of Caesars Entertainment may make decisions with regard to development opportunities for CGP LLC, Hamlet Holdings is in a position to exert a significant influence over both of CAC and Caesars Entertainment and the direction of their business and operations.\nThe interests of Hamlet Holdings and the Sponsors could conflict with or differ from the interests of holders of our Class A common stock. Affiliates of the Sponsors are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies they hold, and may from time to time in the future acquire interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours or may pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, in which case and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nThe concentration of ownership held by Hamlet Holdings could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of us or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination which another stockholder may otherwise view favorably. In addition, a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Hamlet Holdings could cause our stock price to decline. So long as Hamlet Holdings continues to beneficially own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, Hamlet Holdings will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.\nOur stockholders are subject to extensive governmental regulation and if a stockholder is found unsuitable by the gaming authority, that stockholder would not be able to beneficially own our Class A common stock directly or indirectly and we will have the right to redeem the Class A common stock of such disqualified holder.\nIn many jurisdictions, gaming laws can require any of our stockholders to file an application, be investigated and qualify or have his, her or its suitability determined by gaming authorities. Gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant should be deemed suitable. Subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved, for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities. For additional information on the criteria used in making determinations regarding suitability, see \"Gaming Regulation Overview\" in Exhibit 99.2 of this annual report.\nFor example, under Nevada gaming laws, each person who acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of any voting security, or beneficial or record ownership of any non-voting security or any debt security, in a public corporation which is registered with the Nevada Gaming Commission, or the Gaming Commission, may be required to be found suitable if the Gaming Commission has reason to believe that his or her acquisition of that ownership, or his or her continued ownership in general, would be inconsistent with the declared public policy of Nevada, in the sole discretion of the Gaming Commission. Any person required by the Gaming Commission to be found suitable shall apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Gaming Commission's request that he or she should do so and, together with his or her application for suitability, deposit with the Nevada Gaming Control Board (the \"Control Board\") a sum of money which, in the sole discretion of the Control Board, will be adequate to pay the anticipated costs and charges incurred in the investigation and processing of that application for suitability, and deposit such additional sums as are required by the Control Board to pay final costs and charges. Additionally, under Ohio law, an institutional investor, which is broadly defined and includes any corporation that holds any amount of our stock, will be required to apply for and obtain a waiver of suitability determination.\nFurthermore, any person required by a gaming authority to be found suitable, who is found unsuitable by the gaming authority, may not hold directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of any voting security or the beneficial or record ownership of any non-voting security or any debt security of any public corporation which is registered with the gaming authority beyond the time prescribed by the gaming authority. Such a finding could result in an owner of our securities being required to dispose of their securities at prices less than the price paid for such securities. A violation of the foregoing may constitute a criminal offense. A finding of unsuitability by a particular gaming authority impacts that person\u2019s ability to associate or affiliate with gaming licensees in that particular jurisdiction and could impact the person\u2019s ability to associate or affiliate with gaming licensees in other jurisdictions. The Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions establishing the right to redeem our Class A common stock held by disqualified holders if such holder is determined by any gaming regulatory agency to be unsuitable.\nMany jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and, in some jurisdictions, non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to gaming authorities, and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability, subject to limited exceptions for \"institutional investors\" that hold a company\u2019s voting securities for investment purposes only. Under Maryland gaming laws, we may not sell or otherwise transfer more than 5% of the legal or beneficial interest in Horseshoe Baltimore without the approval of the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission, or the Maryland Commission, after the Maryland Commission determines that the transferee is qualified or grants the transferee an institutional investor waiver. Some jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest and in Maryland an individual or business entity may not own an interest in more than one video lottery facility. It is unclear whether and to what extent such prohibitions will apply to online real money gaming operations when and if such operations become legal in U.S. jurisdictions other than Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in CAC may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that may be granted to our directors, officers, employees and service providers in the future. We may decide to establish equity incentive plans that will provide for the grant of common stock-based equity awards to our directors, officers, employees and service providers. In addition, we may issue equity in order to raise capital or in connection with future acquisitions and strategic investments, which would dilute your percentage ownership.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future, you should not expect to receive dividends on shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe have no present plans to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and, for the foreseeable future, intend to retain all of our earnings for use in our business. The declaration of any future dividends by us is within the discretion of our Board and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, as well as any other factors deemed relevant by our Board.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ Marketplace rules and, as a result, will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nHamlet Holdings controls a majority of our voting Class A common stock. As a result, we are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under the NASDAQ Marketplace rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \"controlled company\" and we have elected not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of the Board consists of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nAs a result of these exemptions, we do not have a majority of independent directors nor will our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors and we are not required to have an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees. Accordingly, a holder of our Class A common stock will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and our possible election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable to those of other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our Class A common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \"JOBS Act\"), and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies,\" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \"emerging growth company\" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards such that an \"emerging growth company\" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nWe have elected to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies.\nWe may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\" We will remain an \"emerging growth company\" until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1.0 billion, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a \"large accelerated filer\" under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we will rely on certain of these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs a result of our becoming a company with publicly traded common stock, our expenses and administrative burden increased and will likely further increase particularly after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act.\nAs a company with publicly traded common stock, we incur legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a company without a publicly traded equity security. In addition, our administrative staff is required to perform additional tasks. For example, we need to create or revise the roles and duties of our Board committees and retain a transfer agent. We are also required to hold an annual meeting for our stockholders, which will require us to expend resources to prepare, print and mail a proxy statement relating to the annual meeting.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations implemented by the SEC and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd-Frank\"), which amended the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, among other federal laws, are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. Dodd-Frank, signed into law on July 21, 2010, effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and will subject us to additional federal regulation. We cannot predict with any certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will impact the cost of compliance for a company with publicly traded common stock. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to Dodd-Frank and other new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing\nrevisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. We also expect that being a company with publicly traded common stock, these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. When these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE PRIVATE\nSECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nThis Form 10-K contains or may contain \"forward-looking statements\" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
