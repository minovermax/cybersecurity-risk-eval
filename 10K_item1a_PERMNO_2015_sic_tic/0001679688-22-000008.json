{"cik": "1679688", "company": "DigitalBridge Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us that we currently deem immaterial or that generally apply to all businesses also may adversely impact our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy\nOur business strategy includes owning and/or managing a wide array of asset classes within the digital infrastructure and real estate industry; however, we may not successfully implement this business strategy or ultimately realize any of the anticipated benefits of diversification.\nWe plan to invest, directly or through our managed funds, in multiple asset classes within digital infrastructure and real estate, including but not limited to, data centers, cell towers, fiber networks, small cells and edge infrastructure, throughout the United States and the world. Although there can be no assurance that we will achieve this objective, we intend to build digital infrastructure and real estate portfolios based on key attributes including, but not limited to, (i) market dynamics, (ii) asset quality, with a focus on hard-to-replicate assets, (iii) contract quality, with consideration given to contract duration, tenant quality, and tenant growth opportunities, (iv) management or platform potential, including through organic growth or acquisitions and (v) levels of leverage, based on the risk, duration and structure of cash flows of the underlying asset. However, we may not successfully implement our investment strategy. Even if we do fully achieve these goals, it is possible our multi-asset class portfolio will not perform as well as a portfolio that is concentrated in a particular type of digital assets.\nThere are no limitations on the number or value of particular types of investments that we may make. Even though our investment strategy involves investing in multiple asset classes within digital infrastructure and real estate, we are not required to meet any diversification standards, including geographic diversification standards. Therefore, our investments may become concentrated in type or geographic location. As of the date of this report, substantially all of the digital investments on the Company\u2019s balance sheet are data centers, primarily located in the United States. Our lack of diversification standards, along with our digital-focused investment strategy, could subject us to significant concentration risks with potentially adverse effects on our investment objectives.\nOur status as an owner, operator and investment manager of digital infrastructure and real estate may adversely impact our stock price and our REIT status.\nWe currently are a leading owner, operator and investment manager of digital infrastructure and real estate, which includes owning real estate assets on our balance sheet and operating an investment management platform. While we believe there are advantages to having both direct real estate investments and an investment management platform, these advantages may not be recognized by the investment community and, as a result, our stock price may be adversely affected. There are a very limited number of REITs pursuing an investment management growth strategy similar to our company, which may make it difficult for investors to value our overall business. If our company is perceived by investors as overly complex and difficult to analyze, our ability to raise capital and our stock price may be adversely impacted. We may decide to focus on either being an owner and operator of digital infrastructure and real estate on our balance sheet or operating an investment management platform, but not both.\nIn addition, the pace of growth of our investment management business, coupled with the completion of our legacy asset monetizations, may result in a decision to not continue as a REIT in 2022 or thereafter. If we elect not to continue as a REIT, we would be prohibited from electing to be a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. If we are unable to acquire sufficient qualifying REIT assets in 2022 to offset our legacy asset monetizations and the growth in our investment management business, we may determine that it is not in our best interest to continue qualifying as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income and generally would no longer be required to distribute any of the Company\u2019s net taxable income to our stockholders. The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations currently is 21%. As a REIT, we are permitted to deduct any dividends paid on our stock from our REIT taxable income. While we currently do not pay a dividend on our common stock, we pay dividends on our approximately $883.5 million of outstanding preferred stock. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would not be able to deduct any dividends (including the preferred dividends we currently pay) from our taxable income, which may result in higher income tax expense. A decision to de-REIT may not result in any of the anticipated benefits to our company and could negatively and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, returns to stockholders and the market price of our common stock.\nMoreover, our investment management business may involve risks not otherwise present with a direct investment in an investment vehicle\u2019s target assets, including, among others, investors failing to meet their capital commitment obligations, restrictions on our ability to transfer our interests in an investment vehicle, litigation risk between us and our investors, and exposure to potential liability in connection with our obligations as an investment vehicle\u2019s general partner/manager.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, have and the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to, significantly disrupt, and may materially adversely impact, our business, financial condition and ability to execute on our business objectives.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have, and another pandemic in the future could have, repercussions across regional and global economies and financial markets. The outbreak of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. The preventative measures taken to alleviate the public health crisis, including significant restrictions on travel between the United States and specific countries, and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d or \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders issued by local, state and federal authorities, has resulted in significant supply chain, transportation and labor disruptions and has adversely impacted global commercial activity across many industries. These disruptions, together with government stimulus and spending programs, have caused inflation to rise to its highest levels in the United States in nearly four decades, and concerns of persistent inflation are expected to lead to an environment of rising interest rates, which may negatively and adversely affect our business, our ability to effectuate our objectives and strategies, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nMany experts predict that the pandemic will trigger, or may have already triggered, a prolonged period of global economic slowdown and continued supply chain issues. A sustained downturn in the U.S. economy could delay or negatively impact our ability to raise capital for our current or anticipated digital-focused investment vehicles, which could constrict our ability to grow our business.\nIn addition, COVID-19 has had an adverse impact on the business and financial condition of publicly-traded mortgage REITs, including BRSP, in which the Company owns an approximate 29% interest. The borrowers of BRSP\u2019s real estate debt investments, including in the office, industrial, multifamily and hotel industries, have and will continue to be affected to the extent that COVID-19\u2019s persistence reduces occupancy, increases the cost of operation, limits hours or necessitates the closure of the properties collateralizing such debt investments. In addition, governmental measures, such as quarantines, states of emergencies, restrictions on travel, stay-at-home orders, and other measures taken to curb the spread of the COVID-19 may negatively impact the ability of BRSP\u2019s borrowers or tenants to continue to obtain necessary goods and services or provide adequate staffing, which may also adversely affect BRSP's loan investments and operating results and, consequently, its share price and ability to pay dividends to us. The Company\u2019s FFO is directly impacted by BRSP\u2019s performance as a result of the Company's ownership interest in BRSP and, to the extent BRSP continues to experience operational challenges as a result of COVID-19, our FFO will similarly be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, or a future pandemic, could have material and adverse effects on our business, income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects and ability to service our debt obligations and has, and may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends and other distributions to our stockholders due to, among other factors:\n\u2022difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis and our tenants/borrowers\u2019 abilities to fund their business operations and meet their obligations to us;\n\u2022difficulty raising capital and attracting investors at our current and any future managed investment vehicles due to the volatility and instability in global financial markets may constrain the success of our managed investment vehicles and consequently our ability to sustain and grow our investment management business;\n\u2022the financial impact has and could continue to negatively impact our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or could result in a determination to reduce the size of one or more dividends;\n\u2022the financial impact could negatively impact our future compliance with financial covenants of our securitized debt instruments and other debt agreements and could result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, which non-compliance could also negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings or otherwise pay dividends to our stockholders;\n\u2022the worsening of estimated future cash flows due to a change in our plans, policies, or views of market and economic conditions as it relates to one or more of our adversely impacted properties could result in fair value decreases and the recognition of substantial impairment charges imposed on our assets;\n\u2022the credit quality of our customers/borrowers could be negatively impacted and we may significantly increase our allowance for doubtful accounts;\n\u2022BRSP's trading price and the impact on the carrying value of the Company's investment in BRSP, including whether the Company will recognize further other-than-temporary impairments on such BRSP investment in addition to those recognized in the second quarter 2020;\n\u2022we have and may continue to implement reductions in our workforce, which could adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations effectively;\n\u2022unanticipated costs and operating expenses and decreased anticipated revenue related to compliance with regulations, such as additional expenses related to staff working remotely, requirements to provide employees with additional mandatory paid time off and increased expenses related to sanitation measures performed at each of our properties, as well as additional expenses incurred to protect the welfare of our employees, such as expanded access to health services;\n\u2022our level of dependence on the Internet, stemming from employees working remotely, and increases in malware campaigns and phishing attacks preying on the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber attacks and cause disruptions to our internal control procedures;\n\u2022we depend, to a significant extent, upon the efforts of our senior management team. If one or more members of our senior management team become sick with COVID-19, the loss of services of such member could adversely affect our business;\n\u2022the potential negative impact on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption; and\n\u2022the continued severity, duration, transmission rate and geographic spread of COVID-19 in the United States and elsewhere, the extent and effectiveness of any other containment measures implemented, public adoption rates of COVID-19 vaccines, including booster shots, the duration of associated immunity and the effectiveness of vaccines, booster shots and treatments against emerging variants of COVID-19, including the Delta and Omicron variants.\nMoreover, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate many of the risks described in this Annual Report.\nGiven the ongoing nature of the outbreak, at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of the ultimate impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, financial performance and operating results. We believe COVID-19\u2019s adverse impact on our business, financial performance and operating results will be significantly driven by a number of factors that we are unable to predict or control, including, for example: the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic\u2019s impact on the U.S. and global economies; the timing, scope and effectiveness of additional governmental responses to the pandemic; the timing and speed of economic recovery, including the availability of a treatment or vaccination for COVID-19; and the negative impact on our fund investors, vendors and other business partners that may indirectly adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe require capital to continue to operate and grow our business, and the failure to obtain such capital, either through the public or private markets or other third-party sources of capital, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to maintain our distributions to our stockholders.\nWe require capital to fund acquisitions and originations of our target investments, to fund our operations, including overhead costs, to fund distributions to our stockholders and to repay principal and interest on our borrowings. We expect to meet our capital requirements using cash on hand, cash flow generated from our operations and investment management activities, sale proceeds from non-core investments and principal and interest payments received from legacy debt investments. However, because of distribution requirements imposed on us to qualify as a REIT which generally requires that we distribute to our stockholders 90% of our taxable income and that we pay tax on any undistributed income, our ability to finance our growth must largely be funded by external sources of capital. As a result, we may have to rely on third-party sources of capital, including public and private offerings of securities and debt financings.\nIn addition, the fee income generated from or expected to be generated from our current and future managed investment vehicles is driven, both directly and indirectly, by the ability to raise capital at such investment vehicles. Our ability to raise capital at our company, as well as at our current and future managed investment vehicles, through the public and private capital markets depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside our control, such as the general economic environment, the regulatory environment, competition in the marketplace, media attention and investor investment allocation preferences. Poor performance by, or negative publicity about, our Company, our strategy, our management or our managed companies could also make it more difficult for us or our managed investment vehicles to raise new capital. Investors in our managed companies may decline to invest in future vehicles we manage, and investors may withdraw their investments in our managed companies (subject to the terms of agreements with such managed company) as a result of poor performance or negative perceptions of our Company or our leadership. In addition, third-party financing may not be available to us when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing to fund or grow our business, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire additional assets and make our debt service payments and our financial condition, results of operations and the ability to fund our distributions to our stockholders would be materially adversely affected.\nAdverse changes in general economic and political conditions could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is materially affected by general economic and political conditions in the United States and globally, and our ability to manage our exposure to these conditions may be very limited. These conditions and/or events can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the ability of our managed vehicles to raise or deploy capital, reducing the value or performance of our investments and the investments made by our managed vehicles and making it more difficult for us and our managed vehicles to realize value from existing investments. Adverse changes in market and economic conditions in the United States or the countries or regions in which we or our managed vehicles invest would likely have a negative impact on the value of our assets and spending and demand for digital and communications infrastructure and technology and, accordingly, our and our managed vehicle\u2019s financial performance, the market prices of our securities, and our ability to pay dividends.\nThe condition of the digital infrastructure and real estate markets in which we operate is cyclical and depends on the condition of the economy in the United States, Europe, China and elsewhere as a whole and to the perceptions of investors of the overall economic outlook. In 2021, inflation in the United States reached its highest level in nearly four decades and there are concerns of persistent inflation in the future, both domestically and internationally, which may lead to central banks to take actions to raise interest rates. Rising interest rates, declining employment levels, declining demand for real estate, declining real estate values or periods of general economic slowdown or recession, increasing political instability or uncertainty, or the perception that any of these events may occur have negatively impacted the digital infrastructure and real estate markets in the past and may in the future negatively impact our operating performance. In addition, the economic condition of each local market where we operate may depend on one or more key industries within that market, which, in turn, makes our business sensitive to the performance of those industries.\nIn addition, political uncertainty may contribute to potential risks beyond our control, such as changes in governmental policy on a variety of matters including trade, manufacturing, development and investment, the restructuring of trade agreements, and uncertainties associated with political gridlock. Any such changes in U.S. or international political conditions, or political uncertainty and instability, in the territories and countries where we or our tenants and customers operate could adversely affect our operating results, our business and the market price of our stock.\nWe have only a limited ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic, political or other conditions, which impedes us from responding quickly to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, certain significant expenditures, such as debt service costs, real estate taxes, and operating and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when market conditions are poor.\nThe digital infrastructure and real estate industry is highly competitive and such competition may materially and adversely affect our performance and ability to execute our strategy.\nThe digital infrastructure and real estate business is highly competitive based on a number of factors, including brand recognition, reputation and pricing pressure on the products and services offered by the companies in which we expect to invest. A reduction in the perceived quality of services and products offered, or if our competitors offer rental, leasing or similar rates at below market rates or below the rates charged by the companies in which we invest, the performance of the companies in which we invest could be adversely impacted and, as a result, our ability to raise third party capital in our current and future digital focused private equity funds could be adversely impacted. In the event that we are unable to continue to grow our digital real estate infrastructure platform as a result of our poor performance or lack of available\nfunding for our investments, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nWe are also subject to significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other digital investors, some of which have greater financial resources than us, including publicly-traded REITs, non-traded REITs, insurance companies, commercial and investment banking firms, private institutional funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and other investors. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer or more favorable operating histories, pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and more ready access to capital which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities. We may not be able to compete successfully for investments. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investments may continue to increase. To the extent we pay higher prices for our target investments or acquire assets on less advantageous terms to us, or are required to do so in the future, due to increased competition, our returns may be lower and the value of our assets may not increase or may decrease significantly below the amount we paid for such assets. If such events occur, we may experience lower returns on our investments.\nOur operations in Europe and elsewhere expose our business to risks inherent in conducting business in foreign markets.\nA portion of our revenues are sourced from our foreign operations in Europe and elsewhere or other foreign markets. Accordingly, our firm-wide results of operations depend in part on our foreign operations. Conducting business abroad carries significant risks, including:\n\u2022our REIT tax status not being respected under foreign laws, in which case any income or gains from foreign sources could be subject to foreign taxes and withholding taxes;\n\u2022changes in real estate and other tax rates, the tax treatment of transaction structures and other changes in operating expenses in a particular country where we have an investment;\n\u2022restrictions and limitations relating to the repatriation of profits;\n\u2022complexity and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws;\n\u2022changes in relative interest rates;\n\u2022translation and transaction risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency and exchange rates;\n\u2022lack of uniform accounting standards (including availability of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"));\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the impact of different business cycles and economic instability;\n\u2022political instability and civil unrest;\n\u2022legal and logistical barriers to enforcing our contractual rights, including in perfecting our security interests, collecting accounts receivable, foreclosing on secured assets and protecting our interests as a creditor in bankruptcies in certain geographic regions;\n\u2022share ownership restrictions on foreign operations;\n\u2022compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including sanctions laws, or anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d); and\n\u2022geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world.\nEach of these risks might adversely affect our performance and impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders required to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT. In addition, there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies and a lack of uniform financial accounting standards and practices (including the availability of information in accordance with GAAP) which could impair our ability to analyze transactions and receive timely and accurate financial information from our investments necessary to meet our reporting obligations to financial institutions or governmental or regulatory agencies.\nWe face possible risks associated with natural disasters, wildfires, weather events, and the physical effects and other impacts of climate change.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters, wildfires, weather events, and the physical effects and other impacts of climate change, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. Over time, our properties located in coastal markets and other areas that may be impacted by climate change are expected to experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels that may cause damage to our properties. As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. Other markets may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that significantly increase energy costs or result in additional regulatory burdens, such as stricter energy efficiency standards. Weather events and climate change may also affect our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs, such as energy costs, and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. There can be no assurance that natural disasters, wildfires, weather events, or climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.\nWe are subject to increasing focus by our fund investors, our stockholders and regulators on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters.\nOur fund investors, stockholders, regulators and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters. Certain fund investors, including public pension funds, have considered our record of socially responsible investing and other ESG factors in determining whether to invest in our funds. Similarly, certain of our stockholders, particularly institutional investors, use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure our ESG practices, and use such information to decide whether to invest in our common stock or engage with us to require changes to our practices. If our ESG practices do not meet the standards set by these fund investors or stockholders, they may choose not to invest in our funds or exclude our common stock from their investments, and we may face reputational challenges by other stakeholders. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on new fundraises and negatively affect the price of our stock. In addition, there has also been an increased regulatory focus on ESG-related practices by investment managers by the SEC and other regulators. If regulators disagree with the procedures or standards we use for ESG investing, or new regulation or legislation requires a methodology of measuring or disclosing ESG impact that is different from our current practice, our business and reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on the development and growth of a balanced customer base, including key customers, and failure to attract, grow and retain this base of customers or future consolidation in the technology industry could harm our business and operating results.\nOur ability to maximize operating revenues depends on our ability to develop and grow a balanced customer base, consisting of a variety of companies, including cloud and IT service providers, network providers and other technology companies. We consider certain of these customers to be key in that they attract and assist in retaining other customers. Our ability to attract and maintain customers depends on a variety of factors, including the demand for data center space and other digital infrastructure and our operating reliability and security. In addition, our customer base may shrink as a result of mergers or acquisitions, resulting in a reduced number of customers or potential customers. Any of these factors may increase churn and hinder the development, growth and retention of a balanced customer base, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Digital Investment Management Business\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the quality of service provided to clients, brand recognition and business reputation. Our investment management business competes for clients, personnel and investment opportunities with a large number of private equity funds, specialized investment funds, hedge funds, corporate buyers, traditional investment managers, commercial banks, investment banks, other investment managers and other financial institutions, and we expect that competition will increase. Numerous factors serve to increase our competitive risks, some of which are outside of our control, including that:\n\u2022a number of our competitors have more personnel and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do;\n\u2022many of our competitors have raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital, and many of them have investment objectives similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that we seek to exploit;\n\u2022some of our competitors (including strategic competitors) may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to our\nmanaged companies, particularly our managed companies that directly use leverage or rely on debt financing of their portfolio companies to generate superior investment returns;\n\u2022some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments;\n\u2022our competitors may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment that we cannot, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment;\n\u2022there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new funds, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various lines of business, including major commercial and investment banks and other financial institutions, have resulted in increased competition;\n\u2022some investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager whose equity securities are not traded on a national securities exchange;\n\u2022some investors may prefer to pursue investments directly instead of investing through one of our managed companies;\n\u2022other industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us; and\n\u2022other investment managers may offer more products and services than we do, have more diverse sources of revenue or be more adept at developing, marketing and managing new products and services than we are.\nWe may find it harder to raise capital in the REITs, private funds and other investment vehicles that we manage, and we may lose investment opportunities in the future, if we do not match the fees, structures and terms offered by competitors to their fund clients. Alternatively, we may experience decreased profitability, rates of return and increased risk of loss if we match the prices, structures and terms offered by competitors. This competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future managed investment vehicles, either of which would adversely impact our business, revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nPoor performance of our current and future managed investment vehicles could cause a decline in our revenue, income and cash flow.\nThe fee arrangements we have with certain of our managed investment vehicles are based on the respective performance of such companies. As a result, poor performance or a decrease in value of assets under management of such managed companies (or any companies we may manage in the future with similar performance-based fees) would result in a reduction of our investment management and other fees, carried interest and/or other incentive fees and consequently cause our revenue, income and cash flow to decline. Further, to the extent that we have an investment in a managed investment vehicle, poor performance at such investment vehicle could cause us to suffer losses on such investments of our own capital.\nInvestors in our current or future managed investment vehicles may negotiate terms less favorable to us than those of investment vehicles we currently manage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with sponsoring new managed investment vehicles or securing additional capital commitments in existing investment vehicles, we will negotiate terms for such investment vehicles and commitments from investors. In addition, we have agreed and may in the future agree to re-negotiate terms in the agreements with our investment vehicles due to performance of such investment vehicles or other market conditions. The outcome of such negotiations have and could in the future result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us economically than the existing terms of our investment vehicles or vehicles advised by our competitors. We have recorded and may in the future need to record impairments in the goodwill associated with such agreements as a result of amended economic terms in such agreements. Further, we may also agree to terms that could restrict our ability to sponsor competing investment vehicles, require us to dispose of an investment within a certain period of time, restrict our ability to sell all or a portion of our position in a co-investment, increase our obligations as the manager or require us to take on additional potential liabilities. Agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us could result in a decrease in our profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nValuation methodologies for certain assets in our managed institutional private funds can involve subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect, which could result in the misstatement of performance and accrued performance fees of an institutional private fund.\nThere are often no readily ascertainable market prices for a substantial majority of illiquid investments of our managed institutional private funds. We determine the fair value of the investments of each of our institutional private funds at least quarterly based on the fair value guidelines set forth by GAAP. The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework that ranks the observability of market inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nInvestments for which market prices are not observable include, but are not limited to, illiquid investments in operating companies, real estate, energy ventures and structured vehicles, and encompass all components of the capital structure, including equity, mezzanine, debt, preferred equity and derivative instruments such as options and warrants. Fair values of such investments are determined by reference to (1) the market approach (i.e., multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company or asset, such as earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable public entities or transactions, adjusted by management as appropriate for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables), (2) the income approach (i.e., discounting projected future cash flows of the investee company or asset and/or capitalizing representative stabilized cash flows of the investee company or asset) and (3) other methodologies such as prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services, option pricing models and replacement costs.\nThe determination of fair value using these methodologies takes into consideration a range of factors including but not limited to the price at which the investment was acquired, the nature of the investment, local market conditions, the multiples of comparable securities, current and projected operating performance and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of management judgment. For example, as to investments that we share with another sponsor, we may apply a different valuation methodology than the other sponsor does or derive a different value than the other sponsor has derived on the same investment, which could cause some investors to question our valuations.\nBecause there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in an institutional private fund\u2019s net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would be obtained by us on behalf of the institutional private fund when such investments are realized. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior institutional private fund net asset values would result in reduced earnings or losses for the applicable fund and the loss of potential management fees, carried interest and incentive fees. Changes in values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in the net asset values and results of operations that we report from period to period. Also, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in prior institutional fund net asset values could cause investors to lose confidence in us, which could in turn result in difficulty in raising additional institutional private funds.\nFurther, the SEC has highlighted valuation practices as one of its areas of focus in investment advisor examinations and has instituted enforcement actions against advisors for misleading investors about valuation. If the SEC were to investigate and find errors in our methodologies or procedures, we and/or members of our management could be subject to penalties and fines, which could harm our reputation and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe organization and management of our current and future investment vehicles may create conflicts of interest.\nWe currently manage, and may in the future manage, private funds, REITs and other investment vehicles that have investment and/or rate of return objectives similar to our own. Those entities may be in competition with us with respect to investment opportunities, potential purchasers, sellers and lessees of properties, and mortgage financing opportunities. We have agreed to implement certain procedures to help manage any perceived or actual conflicts among us and our managed investment vehicles, including the following:\n\u2022allocating investment opportunities based on numerous factors, including investment objectives, available cash, diversification/concentration, leverage policy, the size of the investment, tax, anticipated pipeline of suitable investments and fund life;\n\u2022all co-investment transactions with managed investment vehicles are subject to the approval of the independent directors of such investment vehicles that are publicly registered companies or previously approved in applicable company documentation, as the case may be; and\n\u2022investment allocations are reviewed at least annually by the chief compliance officer of our applicable registered investment adviser and/or the board of directors of the applicable investment vehicle that is a publicly registered company, as the case may be.\nWe may also in the future manage private funds, REITs and other investment vehicles that have investment and/or rate of return objectives that directly overlap with our own, which may result in conflicts that cannot be mitigated by the foregoing procedures and would limit our ability to make future direct investments in digital infrastructure assets.\nIn addition, subject to compliance with the rules promulgated under the Investment Advisers Act, we have and may continue to allow a managed investment vehicle to enter into principal transactions with us or cross-transactions with other managed investment vehicles or strategic vehicles. For certain cross-transactions, we may receive a fee from, or increased fees from, the managed investment vehicle and conflicts may exist. If our interests and those of our managed companies are not aligned, we may face conflicts of interests that result in action or inaction that is detrimental to us, our managed investment vehicles, our strategic partnerships or our joint ventures.\nIn addition, in general, the DBH Portfolio Companies, including DataBank and Vantage SDC, and our sponsored funds have priority over us with respect to digital investment opportunities in the target asset classes and the jurisdictions in which we expect to invest. However, as a result of our acquisition of a controlling ownership interest in DataBank and Vantage SDC, we may be in a position to control whether DataBank or Vantage SDC, as applicable, accepts an investment allocation, which could result in conflicts of interest. Further, certain officers and senior management who make allocation decisions may have financial interests in a particular fund or managed investment vehicle, which may increase such conflicts of interest.\nAppropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest would have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which would materially adversely affect our business and our ability to raise capital in future managed companies.\nConflicts of interest may also arise in the allocation of fees and costs among our managed companies that we incur in connection with the management of their assets. This allocation sometimes requires us to exercise discretion and there is no guarantee that we will allocate these fees and costs appropriately.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Wafra strategic partnership.\nAlthough the strategic partnership with Wafra in our Digital IM Business is expected to result in certain benefits to us, there can be no assurance, however, regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize these and any other benefits we expect from the transaction, which may be difficult, unpredictable and subject to delays.\nIn addition, pursuant to the strategic partnership documentation, Wafra has certain redemption rights which, if exercised, would require the Company to repurchase Wafra's equity investment, carried interest participation rights and warrants. If such redemption rights are exercised, Wafra will also have a redemption right with respect to any sponsor commitments previously made to the Company's funds and vehicles. Wafra's redemption rights are triggered upon the occurrence of certain events including key person or cause events under the governing documentation of certain digital investment vehicles. No assurance can be given that such redemption events, if triggered, would arise at a time when the Company will have the cash on hand or other available liquidity (including availability under the Company\u2019s securitized financing facility) to satisfy the redemptions, which could result in the Company being forced to allocate capital away from other potential opportunities or uses that we would otherwise consider to be the most effective use of such capital.\nAdditionally, under certain circumstances, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Wafra to facilitate the conversion of Wafra\u2019s equity investment into the Company's class A common stock. There can be no assurances that such conversion would occur or on what terms and conditions such conversion would occur, including whether such conversion, if it did occur in the future, would have any adverse impact on the Company, the Company\u2019s stock price, governance and other matters.\nIf any or all of the risks described above, including the risk that the redemption obligations are triggered, were to materialize, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses, and we may expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nWe intend, to the extent that market conditions warrant, to seek to grow our businesses by increasing AUM in existing businesses, pursuing new investment strategies, developing new types of investment structures and products (such as separately managed accounts and structured products), and expanding into new geographic markets and businesses. Introducing new types of investment structures and products could increase the complexities involved in managing such investments, including ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.\nThe success of our organic growth strategy will depend on, among other things, our ability to correctly identify and create products that appeal to the limited partners of our funds and vehicles. While we have made significant expenditures to develop these new strategies and products, there is no assurance that they will achieve a satisfactory level of scale and profitability. To raise new funds and pursue new strategies, we have and expect to continue to use our balance sheet to warehouse seed investments, which may decrease the liquidity available for other parts of our business. If a new strategy or fund does not develop as anticipated and such investments are not ultimately transferred to a fund, we may not be able to dispose of such investments at an advantageous time and may be forced to realize losses on these retained investments.\nTo the extent we expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with:\n\u2022our ability to successfully negotiate and enter into beneficial arrangements with our counterparties;\n\u2022the required investment of capital and other resources;\n\u2022the possibility of diversion of management's time and attention from our core business;\n\u2022the possibility of disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u2022the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in foreign jurisdictions, such as taxation;\n\u2022properly managing conflicts of interests; and\n\u2022our ability to comply with new regulatory regimes.\nOur funds may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time.\nOur funds may make investments of which they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved, either by expiration of such fund\u2019s term or otherwise. Although we generally expect that our funds will dispose of investments prior to dissolution, we may not be able to do so. The general partners of our funds have only a limited ability to extend the term of the fund with the consent of fund investors or the advisory board of the fund, as applicable, and therefore, we may be required to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of investments during liquidation, which may be at a disadvantageous time. This would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself.\nRisks Related to our Digital Operating Business\nAny failure of our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business reputation and could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nOur digital real estate business depends on providing customers with highly reliable services, including with respect to power supply, physical security and maintenance of environmental conditions. We may fail to provide such service as a result of numerous factors, including mechanical failure, power outage, human error, physical or electronic security breaches, war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, climate change and other natural disasters, sabotage and vandalism.\nProblems at one or more of our data centers or other digital infrastructure assets, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or equipment damage. Substantially all of the customer leases associated with our digital infrastructure assets include terms requiring us to meet certain service level commitments to such customers. Any failure to meet these or other commitments or any equipment damage in our data centers, including as a result of mechanical failure, power outage, human error or other reasons, could subject us to liability under our lease terms, including service level credits against customer rent payments, monetary damages, or, in certain cases of repeated failures, the right by the customer to terminate the lease. Service interruptions, equipment failures or security breaches may also expose us to additional legal liability, regulatory requirements, penalties and monetary damages and damage our brand and reputation, and could cause our customers to terminate or not renew their leases. In addition, we may be unable to attract new customers if we have a reputation for service disruptions, equipment failures or physical or electronic\nsecurity breaches in our data centers or with regard to other digital infrastructure assets. Any such failures could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not control the operations of certain of our digital real estate assets and are therefore dependent on portfolio company management teams to successfully operate their businesses.\nOur digital infrastructure assets, including the data centers in our Digital Operating business are typically operated by in place management teams at the portfolio companies which hold these assets and in which we own our interests or by third party management companies. While we have or expect to have various rights as an owner of the portfolio companies, we may have limited recourse under our management agreements or investment interest documentation if we believe that such in place management teams (who are not our employees) or third-party management companies are not performing adequately. Failure by the in-place management teams to adequately manage the risks associated with managing data centers could result in defaults under our borrowings and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, if these portfolio companies or management companies experience any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe performance of our digital assets depends upon the demand for such assets.\nA reduction in the demand for our digital infrastructure assets, power or connectivity will adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy and our performance. Demand for digital assets is particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns as well as adverse developments in the data center, Internet and data communications and broader technology industries. Any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate IT spending or reduced demand for data center space and other digital infrastructure assets. Reduced demand could also result from business relocations, including to metropolitan areas that we do not currently or expect to serve. Changes in industry practice or in technology could also reduce demand for the physical data center space or other digital infrastructure assets. In addition, our customers may choose to develop new data centers or expand their own existing data centers or consolidate into data centers that we do not own or operate, which could reduce demand for our newly developed data centers or result in the loss of one or more key customers. If we lose a customer or a tenant, we cannot assure you that we would be able to replace that customer at a competitive rate or at all. Mergers or consolidations of technology companies could reduce further the number of our customers/tenants and potential customers/tenants and make us more dependent on a more limited number of customers. If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, they may discontinue or reduce the use of our data centers or other digital infrastructure assets. Our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow for distributions could be materially adversely affected as a result of any or all of these factors.\nWe are dependent upon third-party suppliers for power and certain other services, and we are vulnerable to service failures of our third-party suppliers and to price increases by such suppliers.\nWe generally rely on third-party local utilities to provide power to our data centers. We are therefore subject to an inherent risk that such local utilities may fail to deliver such power in adequate quantities or on a consistent basis, and our recourse against the local utility and ability to control such failures may be limited. If power delivered from the local utility is insufficient or interrupted, we would be required to provide power through the operation of our on-site generators, generally at a significantly higher operating cost than we would pay for an equivalent amount of power from the local utility. We may not be able to pass on the higher cost to our customers.\nIn addition, even when power supplies are adequate, we may be subject to pricing risks and unanticipated costs associated with obtaining power from various utility companies. Utilities are and may be subject to increasing regulation that could increase the costs of electricity, including wildfire mitigation plans. Utilities may be dependent on, and be sensitive to price increases for, a particular type of fuel, such as coal, oil or natural gas. In addition, the price of these fuels and the electricity generated from them could increase as a result of proposed legislative measures related to climate change or efforts to regulate carbon emissions. In any of these cases, increases in the cost of power at any of our data centers could put those locations at a competitive disadvantage relative to data centers served by utilities that can provide less expensive power.\nWe depend on third parties to provide network connectivity to the customers in our data centers, and any delays or disruptions in connectivity may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends as well as the market price of our common stock.\nOur customers require internet connectivity and connectivity to the fiber networks of multiple third-party telecommunications carriers. In order for us to attract and retain customers, our data centers need to provide sufficient access for customers to connect to those carriers. While we provide space and facilities in our data centers for carriers to\nlocate their equipment and connect customers to their networks, any carrier may elect not to offer its services within our data centers or may elect to discontinue its service. Furthermore, carriers may periodically experience business difficulties which could affect their ability to provide telecommunications services, or the service provided by a carrier may be inadequate or of poor quality. If carriers were to terminate connectivity within our data centers or if connectivity were to be degraded or interrupted, it could put that data center at a competitive disadvantage versus a competitor\u2019s data center that does provide adequate connectivity. A material loss of adequate third-party connectivity could have an adverse effect on the businesses of our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect certain of the leases we have with our customers to expire each year or are on a month-to-month basis, and to contain early termination provisions. If leases with our customers are not renewed on the same or more favorable terms or are terminated early by our customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed.\nCustomers for our data centers may not renew their leases upon expiration. This risk is increased to the extent our customer leases expire on an annual basis. Upon expiration, our customers may elect not to renew their leases or renew their leases at lower rates, for less space, for fewer services or for shorter terms. If we are unable to successfully renew or continue our customer leases on the same or more favorable terms or subsequently re-lease available data center space when such leases expire, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, certain of our leases may contain early termination provisions that allow our customers to reduce the term of their leases subject to payment of an early termination charge that is often a specified portion of the remaining rent payable on such leases. The exercise by customers of early termination options could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe digital infrastructure assets that we own may become obsolete, which could materially and adversely impact our revenue and operations.\nData centers require infrastructure, such as power and cooling systems, that is difficult and costly to upgrade. If the infrastructure in our data centers or other digital infrastructure assets becomes obsolete due to the development of new server technologies, we may need to upgrade or change the systems in order to keep our existing tenants or attract new tenants. We may not be able to effectively or efficiently upgrade or change such infrastructure and may incur substantial costs in doing so. Any inability to upgrade or change our digital infrastructure assets in connection with technological developments may result in the loss of tenants and adversely impact our ability to attract new tenants, all of which could materially and adversely impact our revenues and operations.\nDigital infrastructure and real estate investments are subject to substantial government regulation.\nDigital infrastructure and real estate investments are subject to substantial government regulation related to the acquisition and operation of such investments. Failure to comply with applicable government regulations or the inability to obtain or maintain any required government permits, licenses, concessions, leases or contracts needed to operate our digital infrastructure and real estate investments could adversely affect our ability to achieve our investment objectives. In addition, governments often have considerable discretion to implement regulations that affect our digital infrastructure and real estate investments. Changes in existing regulations could be costly for us to comply with and may delay or prevent the operation of our assets, all of which could adversely impact the performance of our investments.\nWe often pursue investment opportunities that involve business, regulatory, legal or other complexities and the failure to successfully manage such risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe often pursue unusually complex investment opportunities involving substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity that would deter other investors. Our tolerance for complexity presents risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute, it can be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions, and such transactions sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent liabilities. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our investments may be illiquid and we may not be able to vary our investment portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions.\nOur investments are relatively illiquid. As a result, our ability to vary our investment portfolio promptly in response to changed economic and other conditions is limited, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay dividends and make distributions. In addition, the liquidity of our investments may also be impacted by, among other things, restrictions on a REIT\u2019s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other\ntypes of real estate companies, other legal or contractual restrictions, the lack of available financing for assets, the absence of a willing buyer or an established market and turbulent market conditions. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments at advantageous times or in a timely manner if the need or desire arises, including, if necessary, to maintain our status as a REIT or to maintain our exemption from the 1940 Act. If we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our assets. If and to the extent that we use leverage to finance our investments that are or become liquid, the adverse impact on us related to trying to sell assets in a short period of time for cash could be greatly exacerbated.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure and Business Operations\nWe depend on our key personnel, and the loss of their services or the loss of investor confidence in such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on the efforts, skill, reputations and business contacts of our key personnel, including our executive officers, which include our Chief Executive Officer and President, Marc C. Ganzi, in particular, and the services of the other members of our senior management team, including Jacky Wu, Ronald M. Sanders and Sonia Kim, each of whom has entered into an employment agreement with us. For instance, the extent and nature of the experience of our executive officers and the nature of the relationships they have developed with digital real estate professionals, financial institutions, investors in certain of our investment vehicles and other members of the business community are critical to the success of our business. Changes to our management team have occurred in the past, and we cannot assure stockholders that further changes will not be made. We also cannot assure stockholders of the continued employment of these individuals with the Company.\nIn addition, our success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued services of key personnel in our investment management business, including Mr. Ganzi and Benjamin Jenkins, DBH\u2019s co-founder and Chief Investment Officer of DigitalBridge Investment Management. Although Mr. Ganzi and Mr. Jenkins received equity interests in us and are subject to employment agreements and other agreements containing restrictions on engaging in activities that are deemed competitive to our business, there can be no assurances that they will continue employment with us. The loss of Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins or other key personnel could harm our business.\nIn addition, certain of our current and former key personnel have been and may continue to be the subject of media attention, which includes scrutiny or criticism of our Company, business and leadership. Such attention and scrutiny could negatively impact our reputation as well as that of our key personnel, which could in turn negatively impact the relationships our key personnel have with current and potential investors, business partners, vendors and employees. Negative perceptions of or a loss of investor confidence in our key personnel could adversely impact our business prospects.\nThere may be conflicts of interest between us and our Chief Executive Officer and certain other senior DBH employees that could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.\nPrior to our combination with DBH, Marc C. Ganzi, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Benjamin Jenkins, Chief Investment Officer of DigitalBridge Investment Management, made personal investments in certain portfolio companies and/or related vehicles (collectively, the \u201cDBH Portfolio Companies\u201d), which DBH acquired along with a consortium of third-party investors. In the DBH combination, we acquired the contracts to provide investment advisory and other business services to the DBH Portfolio Companies, while Mr. Ganzi and Mr. Jenkins retained their respective investments in the DBH Portfolio Companies. As a result of these personal investments and related outside business activities, Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins and certain other senior DBH employees may have control, veto rights or significant influence over, or be required to represent the interests of certain third party investors in, major decisions and other operational matters at the DBH Portfolio Companies. In addition, Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins and certain other DBH employees may be entitled to receive carried interest payments from the DBH Portfolio Companies upon the occurrence of certain events. As a result, Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins, and certain other senior DBH employees, may have different objectives than us regarding the performance and management of, transactions with or investment allocations to, the DBH Portfolio Companies. The Company has attempted, and will continue to attempt, to manage and mitigate actual or potential conflicts of interest between us, on the one hand, and Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins and certain other senior DBH employees, on the other hand; however, there can be no assurances that such attempts will be effective.\nAs a result of their personal investments, Mr. Ganzi and Mr. Jenkins received payments in connection with Vantage SDC\u2019s purchase of the Santa Clara data center in September 2021 and may in the future realize additional carried interest payments from their interests in DataBank following the Company\u2019s acquisition of additional interests in DataBank from a third party. The amount of carried interest they receive from the Company may also increase as the Company contributes additional capital to Vantage SDC and DataBank in connection with future expansions projects. In such transactions, the\nCompany took a series of steps to mitigate the conflicts in the transactions, including, among others, obtaining approval from an independent committee of the board of directors. For additional information regarding the DataBank and Vantage SDC acquisitions, see Note 18. Transactions with Affiliates, in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. In addition, Mr. Ganzi realized substantial payments in connection with the acquisition of a legacy DBH Portfolio Company by DBP II in 2021.\nSubject to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and related party transaction policies and procedures as applicable, we may continue to enter into transactions or other arrangements with the DBH Portfolio Companies in which there are actual or potential conflicts of interests between us and Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins and certain other senior employees. Despite having related party policies and procedures in place and having conflict mitigants in such transactions, such transactions may not be on terms as favorable to us as they would have been if they had been negotiated among unrelated parties. In addition, such transactions may result in future conflicts of interest if Mr. Ganzi\u2019s or Mr. Jenkins\u2019 continuing interests in the transaction (if any) are not aligned with the Company's.\nWe have been and may continue to be subject to the actions of activist stockholders, which could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have been and may continue to be the subject of increased activity by activist stockholders. Responding to stockholder activism can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan. Activist campaigns can create perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, tenants/operators/managers and joint venture partners, cause us to incur increased legal, advisory and other expenses and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation. Moreover, if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, even though less than a majority, our ability to effectively and timely implement our current initiatives and execute on our long-term strategy may be adversely affected.\nOur assets may continue to be subject to impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily real estate held for investment, for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In evaluating and/or measuring impairment, the Company considers, among other things, current and estimated future cash flows associated with each property, market information for each sub-market and other quantitative and qualitative factors. Another key consideration in this assessment is the Company's assumptions about the highest and best use of its real estate investments and its intent and ability to hold them for a reasonable period that would allow for the recovery of their carrying values. These key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results if the property was disposed. Changes in our strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss, and such loss could be material to our financial condition or operating performance. If, after giving effect to such changes, we conclude that the carrying values of such assets or asset groups are no longer recoverable, we may recognize impairments in future periods equal to the excess of the carrying values over the estimated fair value. Such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, we have and may continue to recognize impairments on the Company's equity method investments and goodwill. For example, given the prolonged period of time that the carrying value of our investment in BRSP had exceeded its market value, we recognized an $275 million other-than-temporary impairment on its BRSP investment in the second quarter 2020.\nThese subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. There can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken.\nThe occurrence of a security breach or a deficiency in our cybersecurity has the potential to disrupt our operations, cause material harm to our financial condition, result in misappropriation of assets, compromise confidential information and/or damage our business relationships.\nAs an asset manager, our business is highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including systems provided by third parties over which we have no control. We may also have limited opportunity to verify the effectiveness of systems provided by third parties or to cause third parties to implement necessary or desirable improvements for such systems. In the normal course of business, we and our service providers process proprietary, confidential, and personal information provided by our customers, employees, and vendors. The risk of a security breach\nor disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions, including by computer hackers, nation-state affiliated actors, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. A security breach or a significant and extended disruption to our systems and, in particular, systems provided by third parties, may result in compromise or corruption of, or unauthorized access to, proprietary, confidential, or personal information collected in the course of conducting our business; misappropriation of assets; disruption of our operations, material harm to our financial condition, cash flows, and the market price of our common shares, significant remediation expenses; and increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs. A security breach or disruption could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, litigation, breach of contracts, reputational harm, damage to our stakeholder relationships, or legal liability.\nThese risks require continuous and likely increasing attention and other resources from us to, among other actions, identify and quantify these risks; upgrade and expand our technologies, systems, and processes to adequately address them; and provide periodic training for our employees to assist them in detecting phishing malware, and other schemes. This diverts time and resources from other activities. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our networks and systems, and the proprietary, confidential and personal information that resides on or is transmitted through them, and we have implemented various cyber security policies, procedures capabilities to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe have and may continue to enter into strategic partnerships and joint ventures to support growth in our business. We may also make investments in partnerships or other co-ownership arrangements or participations with third parties. In connection with our investments, our partners provide, among other things, property management, investment advisory, sub-advisory and other services to us and certain of the companies that we manage. We may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of our strategic partnerships and joint ventures. Such investments and any future strategic partnerships and/or joint ventures subject us and the companies we manage to risks and uncertainties not otherwise present with other methods of investment.\nFor a substantial portion of our assets, we rely upon joint venture partners to manage the day-to-day operations of the joint venture and underlying assets, as well as to prepare financial information for the joint venture. Any failure to perform these obligations may have a negative impact on our financial performance and results of operations. In addition, the terms of the agreements with our partners may limit or restrict our ability to make additional capital contributions for the benefit of properties or to sell or otherwise dispose of properties or interests held in joint ventures, even for ventures where we are the controlling partner. In certain instances, we may not control our joint venture investments. In these ventures, the controlling partner(s) may be able to take actions which are not in our best interests or the best interests of the investments we manage. Furthermore, to the extent that our joint venture partner provides services to the companies we manage, certain conflicts of interest will exist. Moreover, we may decide to terminate a strategic relationship or joint venture partner, which could be costly and time-consuming for our management team.\nAny of the above might subject us to liabilities and thus reduce our returns on our investment with that joint venture partner, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, disagreements or disputes between us and our joint venture partner(s) could result in litigation, which could increase our expenses and potentially limit the time and effort our officers and directors are able to devote to our business.\nWe are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to the risk of substantial litigation and face significant regulatory oversight. Such litigation and proceedings, including, regulatory actions and shareholder class action suits, may result in defense costs, settlements, fines or judgments against us, some of which may not be covered by insurance. Litigation could be more likely in connection with a change of control transaction or during periods of market dislocation, shareholder activism or proxy contests. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could negatively impact our cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and trading price of our shares of class A common stock.\nIn addition, even in the absence of misconduct, we may be exposed to litigation or other adverse consequences where investments perform poorly and investors in or alongside our managed companies experience losses. We depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for us and our managed companies. As a result,\nallegations of improper conduct by private litigants (including investors in or alongside our managed companies) or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the private equity industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm. Fraud and other deceptive practices or other misconduct at our funds\u2019 portfolio companies could similarly subject us to liability and reputational damage and also harm performance.\nOur employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. We are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees would adversely affect our clients and us. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which we may invest. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose confidential information, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. Detecting or deterring employee misconduct is not always possible, and the extensive precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If one of our employees were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have devoted greater resources to enforcement of the FCPA. In addition, the U.K. has also significantly expanded the reach of its anti-bribery laws. While we have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure strict compliance by us and our personnel with the FCPA, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA, the U.K. anti-bribery laws or other applicable anti-corruption laws could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties or material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects, financial position or the market value of our common stock.\nIn addition, we may also be adversely affected if there is misconduct by personnel of portfolio companies in which our funds invest. For example, financial fraud or other deceptive practices at our funds\u2019 portfolio companies, or failures by personnel at our funds\u2019 portfolio companies to comply with anti-bribery, trade sanctions, anti-harassment, anti-discrimination or other legal and regulatory requirements, could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties or material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct and securities litigation, and could also cause significant reputational and business harm to us. Such misconduct may undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such portfolio companies and could negatively affect the valuations of the investments by our funds in such portfolio companies. In addition, we may face an increased risk of such misconduct to the extent our investment in non-U.S. markets, particularly emerging markets, increases.\nRisks Related to Financing\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations.\nOur ability to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations (including those under our securitized debt instruments), to refinance our existing or potential future indebtedness, and to fund our operations, working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other important business uses, depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow in the future. Our future cash flow is subject to, among other factors, general economic, industry, financial, competitive, operating, legislative, and regulatory conditions, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future sources of cash will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations, or to fund our other important business uses or liquidity needs. Furthermore, if we incur additional indebtedness in connection with future acquisitions or for any other purpose, our existing or potential future debt service obligations could increase significantly and our ability to meet those obligations could depend, in large part, on the returns from such acquisitions or projects, as to which no assurance can be given.\nFurthermore, our obligations under the terms of our borrowings could impact us negatively. For example, such obligations could:\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022restrict us from paying dividends to our stockholders;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our borrowings, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities.\nWe may also need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or prior to the scheduled maturity. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing will depend on, among other things, (i) our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, FFO prospects, and then-current market conditions; and (ii) restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness. As a result, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nIn particular, our securitization co-issuers\u2019 ability to refinance the securitization debt instruments or sell their interests in the securitization collateral will be affected by a number of factors, including the availability of credit for the collateral, the fair market value of the securitization collateral, our securitization entities\u2019 financial condition, the operating history of the securitization managed funds, tax laws and general economic conditions. The ability of our securitization entities to sell or refinance their interests in the securitization collateral at or before the anticipated repayment date of the securitization debt instruments will also be affected by the degree of our success in forming new funds as additional managed funds for the securitization collateral pool. In the event that our securitization entities are not able to refinance the securitization debt instruments prior to the anticipated repayment date for such instruments, the interest payable on such securitization debt instruments will increase, which will reduce the cash flow available to us for other purposes.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and additional borrowings or refinancings are not available to us, we may be unable to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations. As a result, we would be forced to take other actions to meet those obligations, such as selling properties, raising equity or delaying capital expenditures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effect any of these actions on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe securitization transaction documents impose certain restrictions on our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries, and the failure to comply with such restrictions could adversely affect our business.\nThe indenture and other agreements entered into by certain of our subsidiaries contain various covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to engage in specified types of transactions. For example, among other things covenants restrict (subject to certain exceptions) the ability of certain subsidiaries to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022alter the business conducted by our subsidiaries;\n\u2022create new subsidiaries or alter our current cash distribution arrangements;\n\u2022create or incur liens on certain assets; or\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets held within the securitization entities.\nIn addition, under the transaction documents related to our securitization transactions, a failure to comply with certain covenants could prevent our securitization entities from distributing any excess cash to us, which may limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may not have adequate resources or the flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for our growth, which could adversely affect our future growth prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe securitized debt instruments issued by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have restrictive terms, and any failure to comply with such terms could result in default, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe securitization debt instruments are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the securitization co-issuers maintain specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the securitization notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified prepayment consideration in the case of the securitization term notes under certain circumstances, (iii) in the event that the securitization notes are not fully repaid by their applicable\nrespective anticipated repayment dates, provisions relating to additional interest that will begin to accrue from and after such respective anticipated repayment dates and (iv) covenants relating to record keeping, access to information and similar matters. The securitization notes are also subject to customary amortization events, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios. The securitization notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the securitization notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties and the termination for cause of certain limited partnership agreements of investment vehicles managed by us resulting in a specified percentage decrease of annualized recurring fees.\nIn the event that an amortization event occurs under the indenture which would require repayment of the securitization debt instruments or in the event of failure to repay or refinance the securitized debt instruments prior to the anticipated repayment date, the funds available to us would be reduced, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate and/or grow our business. If our subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If our subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nChanges in the debt financing markets could negatively impact our ability to obtain attractive financing or re-financing for our investments and could increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income.\nA significant contraction in the market for debt financing, such as the contraction that occurred in 2008 and 2009, or other adverse changes relating to the terms of such debt financing with, for example, higher interest rates, higher capital requirements and/or more restrictive covenants, particularly in the area of acquisition financings for leveraged buyout and real assets transactions, could have a material adverse impact on our business. In the event that we are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at an increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms, we may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case, either of which could lead to a decrease in the income earned by us. Similarly, we regularly utilize the corporate debt markets in order to obtain financing for our operations. To the extent that the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact our operating performance. In addition, to the extent that the markets make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, we may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect the value of our investments and cause our interest expense to increase, which could result in reduced earnings or losses and negatively affect our profitability as well as the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nThe value of our investments in certain assets may decline if long-term interest rates increase. Declines in the value of our investments may ultimately reduce earnings or result in losses to us, which may negatively affect cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Significant increases in interest rates may, among other things, increase the credit risk of our assets by negatively impacting the ability of the borrowers to pay debt service on our floating rate loan assets or our ability to refinance our assets upon maturity, negatively impact the value of the real estate collateralizing our investments (or the real estate we own directly) through the impact such increases can have on property valuation capitalization rates and decrease the value of our fixed-rate debt investments.\nIn addition, in a period of rising interest rates, our operating results will partially depend on the difference between the income from our assets and financing costs. We anticipate that, in some cases, the income from such assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings. Consequently, changes in interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates, may significantly influence our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning investments and the interest expense we incur in financing these investments. Increases in these rates could decrease our net income and the market value of our assets.\nRising interest rates may also affect the yield on our investments or target investments and the financing cost of our debt. If rising interest rates cause us to be unable to acquire a sufficient volume of our target investments with a yield that is above our borrowing cost, our ability to satisfy our investment objectives and to generate income and pay dividends may be materially and adversely affected. Due to the foregoing, significant fluctuations in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nChanges in the reference rate used in our existing floating rate debt instruments and hedging arrangements is uncertain and may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and could hinder our ability to maintain effective hedges, potentially resulting in adverse impacts to our business operations and financial results.\nOur securitization variable funding notes, certain senior and junior subordinated notes and certain hedging transactions determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or to another financial metric. On March 5, 2021, LIBOR\u2019s regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, and administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, Limited, announced that the publication of the one-week and two-month US Dollar LIBOR (\u201cUSD LIBOR\u201d) maturities and non-USD LIBOR maturities will cease immediately after December 31, 2021, with the remaining USD LIBOR maturities ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023. In the U.S., the Alternative Rates Reference Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d), a group of market participants convened in 2014 to help ensure a successful transition away from USD LIBOR, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative rate. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. Liquidity in SOFR-linked products has increased significantly this year after the implementation of the SOFR First best practice as recommended by the Market Risk Advisory Committee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nWe can provide no assurance regarding when our current floating rate debt instruments and hedging arrangements will transition from LIBOR as a reference rate to SOFR or another reference rate. To date we have taken steps intended to minimize disruption in our business operations related to changes in the benchmark rate, including, where possible, by providing mechanisms in our LIBOR based instruments that permit or facilitate the movement from LIBOR to replacement benchmarks upon the occurrence of certain defined events occur related to the discontinuation of LIBOR. However, there can be no assurances that such steps will successfully minimize disruption or result in any of the benefits we anticipate. The discontinuation of a benchmark rate or other financial metric, changes in a benchmark rate or other financial metric, or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of a benchmark rate or other financial metric, including LIBOR, could, among other things, result in increased interest payments, changes to our risk exposures, or require renegotiation of previous transactions. In addition, any such discontinuation or changes, whether actual or anticipated, could result in market volatility, adverse tax or accounting effects, increased compliance, legal and operational costs, and risks associated with contract negotiations. Further, confusion related to the transition from USD LIBOR to SOFR or another replacement reference rate for our floating debt and hedging instruments could have an uncertain economic effect on these instruments, hinder our ability to establish effective hedges and result in a different economic value over time for these instruments than they otherwise would have had under USD LIBOR, any of which could adversely impact our business operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nThe market price of our class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and holders of our class A common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment due to drops in the market price of our class A common stock.\nThe market price of our class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Our stockholders may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the implied price at which they acquired such common stock due to fluctuations in the market price of our class A common stock, including changes in market price caused by factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Additionally, this volatility and other factors have and may continue to induce stockholder activism, which has been increasing in publicly traded companies in recent years and to which we have and continue to be subject, and could materially disrupt our business, operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nSpecific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price of our class A common stock include, among others, the following:\n\u2022changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our class A common stock, other companies comparable to it or companies in the industries we serve;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u2022reactions to public announcements by us;\n\u2022changes in our dividend policy;\n\u2022impairment charges affecting the carrying value of one or more of our investments;\n\u2022media attention about our Company or our management team;\n\u2022strategic actions taken by our Company or our competitors, such as business separations, acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022failure of our Company to achieve the perceived benefits of certain transactions and restructurings, including financial results and anticipated cost savings and synergies, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;\n\u2022changes or other announcements regarding our key management personnel;\n\u2022adverse conditions in the financial market or general U.S. or international economic conditions, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, outbreaks of disease and epidemics, such as the Coronavirus, and responses to such events; and\n\u2022sales of common stock by our Company, members of our management team or significant stockholders.\nWe may issue additional equity securities, which may dilute your interest in us.\nIn order to expand our business, we may consider offering class A common stock and securities that are convertible into our class A common stock and may issue additional common stock in connection with acquisitions or joint ventures. If we issue and sell additional shares of our class A common stock, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted to the extent they do not participate in the offering. The number of shares of class A common stock that we may issue for cash in non-public offerings without stockholder approval will be limited by the rules of the NYSE. However, we may issue and sell shares of our class A common stock in public offerings, and there generally are exceptions that allow companies to issue a limited number of equity securities in private offerings without stockholder approval, which could dilute your ownership. In July 2020, the OP issued $300 million in aggregate principal balance of 5.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2023, which are exchangeable by the noteholder at any time prior to maturity into shares of our class A common stock. The initial exchange rate, which is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, was 434.7826 shares of class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we issued 73,365,420 shares of class A common stock in exchange for approximately $161.261 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% exchangeable notes held by certain noteholders in several privately negotiated transactions. The exchange of some or all of the remaining exchangeable notes will further dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, and any sales in the public market of shares of our class A common stock issuable upon such exchange of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price.\nIn addition, we have and may continue to issue OP Units in the OP to current employees or third parties without stockholder approval. During 2019, we issued an aggregate of 22,090,587 OP Units, representing approximately 4.5% of our outstanding class A common stock, primarily in connection with our acquisition of DBH and ownership interest in an edge data center company. Subject to any applicable vesting or lock-up restrictions and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the OP agreement, a holder of OP Units may elect to redeem such OP Units for cash or, at the Company's option, shares of our class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. As a result of such OP Unit issuances and potential future issuances, your ownership will be diluted.\nOur board of directors may modify our authorized shares of stock of any class or series and may create and issue a class or series of common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur Articles of Amendment and Restatement (our \"Charter\") authorizes our board of directors to, without stockholder approval, classify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock; reclassify any previously classified, but unissued, shares of common stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock; and issue such shares of stock so classified or reclassified. Our board of directors may determine the relative rights, preferences, and privileges of any class or series of common stock or preferred stock issued. As a result, we may issue series or classes of common stock or preferred stock with preferences, dividends, powers, and rights (voting or otherwise) senior to the rights of current holders of our class A common stock. The issuance of any such classes or series of common stock or preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Incorporation in Maryland\nThe stock ownership limits imposed by the Code for REITs and our Charter may restrict our business combination opportunities.\nIn order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year following our first year. Our Charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our board of directors to take those actions that are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. In order to assist us in complying with the limitations on the concentration of ownership of REIT stock imposed by the Code,\nour Charter generally prohibits any person (other than a person who has been granted an exemption) from actually or constructively owning more than 9.8% of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our capital stock (as defined in our Charter) by value or 9.8% of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock (as defined in our Charter) by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive. Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, grant an exemption to the ownership limits, subject to certain conditions and the receipt by our board of directors of certain representations and undertakings. The ownership limits imposed under the Code are based upon direct or indirect ownership by \u201cindividuals,\u201d but only during the last half of a tax year. The ownership limits contained in our Charter are based on the ownership at any time by any \u201cperson,\u201d which term includes entities. These ownership limitations are common in REIT charters and are intended to provide added assurance of compliance with the tax law requirements, and to minimize administrative burdens. However, the ownership limit on our common stock might also delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders, and the proposed reduction in the ownership limit could further restrict such transactions that may otherwise not be so delayed or prevented.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (\"MGCL\") may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or impeding a change of control that could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock), or an affiliate thereof, for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights and supermajority voting requirements on these combinations; and\n\u2022\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that holders of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of our company (defined as voting shares which, when aggregated with all other shares owned or controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding \u201ccontrol shares\u201d) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nThe statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d becomes an interested stockholder. Our board of directors has, by resolution, exempted any business combination between us and any person who is an existing, or becomes in the future, an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d provided that any such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of the directors of our company who are not affiliates or associates of such person). Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and any such person. As a result, such person may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute. Additionally, this resolution may be altered, revoked or repealed in whole or in part at any time and we may opt back into the business combination provisions of the MGCL. If this resolution is revoked or repealed, the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer. In the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL, we have elected to opt out of these provisions of the MGCL pursuant to a provision in our bylaws.\nConflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future with the OP and its members, which may impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders.\nConflicts of interest may exist or could arise as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and the OP or any member thereof, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to our Company and our stockholders under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our Company. At the same time, the Company, as sole managing member of the OP, has fiduciary duties to the OP and to its members under Delaware law in connection with the management of the OP. Our duties to the OP and its members, as the sole managing member, may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our Company and our stockholders. As of the date of this report, Mr. Ganzi indirectly owns approximately 1.7% in the OP. These conflicts may be resolved in a manner that is not in the best interest of our stockholders.\nRegulatory Risks\nExtensive regulation in the United States and abroad affects our activities, increases the cost of doing business and creates the potential for significant liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and foreign government agencies and self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions in the United States, are empowered to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular activities, and to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including censure, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of applicable licenses and memberships.\nIn recent years, the SEC and its staff have focused on issues relevant to global investment firms and have formed specialized units devoted to examining such firms and, in certain cases, bringing enforcement actions against the firms, their principals and their employees. Such actions and settlements involving U.S.-based private fund advisers generally have involved a number of issues, including the undisclosed allocation of the fees, costs and expenses related to unconsummated co-investment transactions (i.e., the allocation of broken deal expenses), undisclosed legal fee arrangements affording the adviser greater discounts than those afforded to funds advised by such adviser and the undisclosed acceleration of certain special fees. Recent SEC focus areas have also included, among other things, the misuse of material non-public information, material impacts on portfolio companies owned by private funds (e.g., real estate related investments) due to recent economic conditions, and compliance with practices described in fund disclosures regarding the use of limited partner advisory committees, including whether advisory committee approvals were properly obtained in accordance with fund disclosures.\nThe SEC\u2019s oversight, inspections and examinations of global investment firms, including our firm, have continued to focus on transparency, investor disclosure practices, fees and expenses, valuation and conflicts of interest and whether firms have adequate policies and procedures to ensure compliance with federal securities laws in connection with these and other areas of focus. For example, our managed companies routinely engage our affiliated entities to provide asset level services, in accordance with the relevant fund legal documents. While we believe we have procedures in place reasonably designed to monitor and make appropriate and timely disclosures regarding the engagement and compensation of our affiliated services providers and other matters of current regulatory focus, the SEC\u2019s inspections of our firm have raised concerns about these and other areas of our operations. While we believe we will be able to address such concerns without a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, regulatory matters are uncertain and we may be required to incur costs or take actions that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, in recent years the SEC and several states have initiated investigations alleging that certain private equity firms and hedge funds, or agents acting on their behalf, have paid money to current or former government officials or their associates in exchange for improperly soliciting contracts with the state pension funds (i.e., \u201c pay to play\u201d practices). Such \u201cpay to play\u201d practices are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and any failure on our part to comply with rules surrounding \u201cpay to play\u201d practices could expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage.\nFurther, we expect a greater level of SEC enforcement activity under the Biden administration, and it is possible this enforcement activity will target practices that we believe are compliant and that were not targeted by prior administrations. We regularly are subject to requests for information and informal or formal investigations by the SEC and other regulatory authorities, with which we routinely cooperate and, in the current environment, even historical practices that have been previously examined are being revisited. Even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator were small in monetary amount, the costs incurred in responding to such matters could be material and the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing investors or fail to gain new investors or discourage others from doing business with us.\nIn addition, we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the 1940 Act, the Commodity Exchange Act and ERISA in conducting our investment activities in the United States. Similarly, in conducting our investment activities outside the United States, we rely on available exemptions from the regulatory regimes of various foreign jurisdictions. These exemptions from regulation within the United States and abroad are sometimes highly complex and may, in certain circumstances, depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us, we could become subject to regulatory action or third party claims and our business could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in\nour funds and are not designed to protect our stockholders. Consequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities and impose burdensome compliance requirements.\nIt is difficult to determine the full extent of the impact on us of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law. Any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business, including the changes as a result of, among others, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which we conduct our business. It is expected that the Biden administration will increase the number of financial regulations and regulators. Furthermore, we may become subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as we expand our product offerings and investment platform, including raising additional funds. Moreover, as calls for additional regulation have increased as a result of heightened regulatory focus in the financial industry, there may be a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative asset management funds, including our managed companies. Compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our profitability.\nFailure to satisfy the 40% limitation or to qualify for an exception or exemption from registration under the 1940 Act could require us to register as an investment company or substantially change the way we conduct our business, either of which may have an adverse effect on us and the market price for shares of our class A common stock.\nWe intend to conduct our operations so that we and our subsidiaries are not required to register as investment companies under the 1940 Act. Compliance with the 40% limitation on holding investment securities under the 1940 Act and maintenance of applicable exceptions or exemptions impose certain requirements on how we structure our balance sheet investments and manage our sponsored funds. Continuing satisfaction of the 40% limitation or qualification for an exception or exemption from registration under the 1940 Act will limit our ability to make certain investments or change the relevant mix of our investments.\nIf we fail to satisfy the 40% limitation or to maintain any applicable exception or exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act, either because of changes in SEC guidance or otherwise, we could be required to, among other things: (i) substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations and the assets that we own to avoid being required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act; or (ii) register as an investment company. Either of (i) or (ii) could have an adverse effect on us and the market price for shares of our class A common stock. If we are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and other matters.\nRegulation of subsidiaries of our company under the Investment Advisers Act subjects us to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions.\nWe have subsidiaries that are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act. As a result, we are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions that apply to our relationships with our managed companies. These provisions and duties impose restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our managed companies' investors and our investments, including, for example, restrictions on agency, cross and principal transactions, and transactions with affiliated service providers. We or our registered investment adviser subsidiaries will be subject to periodic SEC examinations and other requirements under the Investment Advisers Act and related regulations primarily intended to benefit advisory clients. These additional requirements relate to, among other things, maintaining an effective and comprehensive compliance program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements and disclosure requirements. Examinations of private fund advisers have resulted in a range of actions, including deficiency letters and, where appropriate, referrals to the Division of Enforcement. The Investment Advisers Act generally grants the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting advisory activities in the event it fails to comply with federal securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements under the Investment Advisers Act include the prohibition of individuals from associating with an investment adviser, the revocation of registrations and other censures and fines. We expect continued focus by the SEC on private fund advisers and a greater level of SEC enforcement activity under the Biden administration.\nRegulation regarding climate change may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in federal and state legislation and regulations on climate change could result in utility expenses and/or capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties or other related aspects of our properties in order to comply with such regulations or otherwise adapt to climate change. These regulations may require unplanned capital improvements, and increased engagement to manage occupant energy use, which is a large driver of building performance. If our properties cannot meet performance standards, we could be exposed to fines for non-compliance, as well as a decrease in demand and a decline in value. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nOur qualification as a REIT involves complying with highly technical and complex provisions of the Code.\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under the U.S. federal income tax laws commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017. Our qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist and even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. New legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. In addition, the pace of growth of our investment management business, coupled with the completion of our legacy asset monetizations, may result in a decision to not continue as a REIT in 2022 or thereafter.\nOur qualification as a REIT depends on our ongoing satisfaction of certain gross asset, gross income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements:\n\u2022Our compliance depends upon the characterization of our assets and income for REIT purposes, as well as the relative values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we typically do not obtain independent appraisals. Moreover, we invest in certain assets with respect to which the rules applicable to REITs may be particularly difficult to interpret or to apply, including certain of our target digital infrastructure and real estate assets. If the IRS challenged our treatment of investments for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, and if such a challenge were sustained, we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\n\u2022The fact that we own direct or indirect interests in several REITs, each a Subsidiary REIT, further complicates the application of the REIT requirements for us. Each Subsidiary REIT is subject to the various REIT qualification requirements that are applicable to us and certain other requirements. If a Subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then (i) that Subsidiary REIT would become subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax, (ii) our interest in such Subsidiary REIT would cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and (iii) it is possible that we would fail certain of the REIT asset tests, in which event we also would fail to qualify as a REIT unless we could avail ourselves of relief provisions.\nIf we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income at the regular corporate rate, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our class A Common Stock. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT.\nComplying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. Compliance with these limitations, particularly given the nature of some of our digital and other investments (including international investments and certain hedging transactions), may hinder our ability to acquire, optimally finance, or maintain ownership of otherwise attractive investments. To maintain our REIT qualification we could sell or be required to sell assets more quickly and on less favorable terms than in a sale not required for REIT qualification.\nOur ownership of assets and conduct of operations through our TRSs is limited and involves certain risks for us.\nConsistent with the REIT qualification requirements, we acquire and own significant assets through our TRSs, including our investment management business. Our TRSs generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, and/or\napplicable foreign, state and local tax. Only their after-tax net income is available for distribution to us and our stockholders. The REIT rules limit our use of TRSs, including as follows:\n\u2022No more than 20% of the value of our gross assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25% of our gross income can consist of dividend, non-mortgage interest income, or gain from our TRSs securities.\n\u2022A 100% excise tax applies to certain amounts related to transactions involving a TRS and its parent REIT that are not priced on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\n\u2022Our leases with our TRSs must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement in order for us to qualify as a REIT and our TRSs must not directly or indirectly operate hotels or healthcare property.\nWe are mindful of these limitations and analyze and structure the income and operations of our TRSs to mitigate these costs and risks to us to the extent practicable, but we may not always be successful in all cases.\nThe ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.\nOur Charter provides that the board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if the board determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income and we generally would no longer be required to distribute any of our net taxable income to our stockholders, which could adversely affect the attractiveness and value of our Common Stock.\nThere is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to REITs.\nThe IRS, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review U.S. federal income tax legislation, regulations and other guidance. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect our taxation or our stockholders. We urge you to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our stock. Although REITs generally receive certain tax advantages compared to entities taxed as non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for us to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporation.\nThe REIT distribution requirements apply only if we have taxable income and, if we are required to make distributions, we will have less cash available to execute our business plan.\nWe generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our \u201cREIT taxable income\u201d (subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain) in order to qualify as a REIT, and any REIT taxable income that we do not distribute will be subject to U.S. corporate income tax at regular rates. If we do not have REIT taxable income or to the extent we utilize loss carryovers from prior years to reduce REIT taxable income, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders.\nWe may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with GAAP, or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur. As a result of both the requirement to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income each year (and to pay tax on any REIT taxable income that we do not distribute) and the fact that our taxable income could exceed our cash income, we may find it difficult to meet the REIT distribution requirements in certain circumstances while also having adequate cash resources to execute our business plan. In particular, where we experience differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash, the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our taxable income could cause us to: (i) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms, or (iii) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt in order to comply with REIT requirements. These alternatives could increase our costs, reduce our equity, and/or result in stockholders being taxed on distributions of shares of stock without receiving cash sufficient to pay the resulting taxes. Thus, compliance with the REIT distribution requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our Common Stock.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the preferential tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to \"qualified dividend income\" paid by non-REIT \"C\" corporations to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally is 20%, whereas ordinary income dividends payable by REITs to those U.S. stockholders generally are not eligible for the 20% rate. Although the reduced\nrates applicable to dividend income from non-REIT \"C\" corporations do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, it could cause investors who are non-corporate taxpayers to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the shares of non-REIT \"C\" corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of our Common Stock.\nWe might elect to distribute our common stock in a taxable distribution in order to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements, in which case stockholders may sell shares of our common stock to pay tax on such distributions, placing downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.\nTo make required REIT distributions and preserve cash, we might elect to make taxable distributions that are payable partly in cash and partly in shares of our common stock. If we made a taxable dividend payable in cash and shares of our common stock, taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be taxed on the full amount of the distribution that otherwise would be a dividend for tax purposes, even though part is paid in stock. If we made a taxable dividend payable in cash and our common stock and a significant number of stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.\nEven if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state income tax (and any applicable non-U.S. taxes) on the net income earned by our TRSs. Our TRSs generally are expected to have material assets and income. In addition, we have substantial operations and assets outside of the U.S. that are subject to tax in those countries, which are not likely to generate an offsetting credit for taxes in the U.S. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from assets or activities that we undertake after foreclosing on our tenants or borrowers, and state or local income, property and transfer taxes, such as mortgage recording taxes. In addition, if we have net income from \u201cprohibited transactions,\u201d that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In general, \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Finally, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nOur ability to use our tax benefits could be substantially limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nOur net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and certain recognized built-in losses may be limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if 5% stockholders increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of the outstanding shares of our company by more than 50 percentage points looking back over the relevant testing period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use our NOLs and certain recognized built-in losses to reduce our REIT distribution requirements or taxable income in a future year would be limited to a Section 382 limitation equal to the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred or will occur is complicated and depends on changes in percentage stock ownership among stockholders. Therefore, no assurance can be provided as to whether an ownership change has occurred or will occur in the future\nWe will be subject to corporate income tax on the sale of assets acquired from or previously held by a non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporation within five years of our acquisition of those assets or our becoming a REIT.\nIf a REIT previously was a non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporation, or it acquires any asset from a non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporation, or a corporation that generally is subject to full corporate-level tax, in a merger or other transaction in which it acquires a basis in the asset that is determined by reference either to the non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporation\u2019s basis in the asset or to another asset, the REIT generally will pay tax at the highest regular corporate rate applicable if it recognizes gain on the sale or disposition of the asset during the five-year period after it becomes a REIT or it acquires the asset.\nWe may incur adverse tax consequences if DigitalBridge was to have failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes prior to the Merger.\nIn connection with the closing of the Merger, we received an opinion of counsel to the effect that DigitalBridge qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Code through the time of the Merger. We did not request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) that DigitalBridge qualified as a REIT. If, notwithstanding the opinion, DigitalBridge\u2019s REIT status for periods prior to the Merger were successfully challenged, we would face serious adverse tax consequences (ranging from corporate tax liability to loss of REIT status for past and future years) that would substantially reduce our FFO, including cash available to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe could be subject to increased taxes if the tax authorities in various international jurisdictions were to modify tax rules and regulations on which we have relied in structuring our international investments.\nWe currently receive favorable tax treatment in various international jurisdictions through tax rules, regulations, tax authority rulings, and international tax treaties. Should changes occur to these rules, regulations, rulings or treaties, we may no longer receive such benefits, and consequently, the amount of taxes we pay with respect to our international investments may increase.", "PERMNO": 14686, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "CLNY"}
