If any of the risks and uncertainties described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risk factors listed below, however, are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe may not be successful in implementing our strategic priorities, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nIn fiscal 2013 and 2014 we worked to implement our strategic priorities under our BLEND Plan 3.0, which we believed necessary to support the Company\u2019s continued growth and long-term stockholder value. For 2015, we are focused on a number of strategic initiatives that we have incorporated into our strategic priorities under the BLEND Plan 3.0, which we believe continues Jamba\u2019s path to a healthy, active lifestyle brand and creates long-term shareholder value, including:\n\u00b7 Brand activation and leadership strength;\n\u00b7 Leverage in innovative in-store experience to drive four-wall store profitability;\n\u00b7 Expand retail footprint on a global basis;\n\u00b7 New products, leadership in smoothies, juice, and bowls; and\n\u00b7 Drive our strategic initiatives of an asset-light business model, a reduction of operating costs and an aggressive return of capital to shareholders to enhance shareholder value.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully implement these strategic priorities or whether these strategic priorities will be successful, and a failure of either could impede our growth and operating results.\nWe have a history of net losses and may incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in five of the last seven fiscal years. We may continue to incur net losses in the future, and we cannot assure you that we will ever sustain profitability.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to identifying and accounting for non-standard transactions. The material weakness we identified due to an insufficient complement of finance and accounting resources within the organization to ensure the proper application of GAAP with respect to the Company\u2019s non-routine transactions, in part attributable to employee turnover related to recently implemented cost reductions and infrastructure changes . A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - An Integrated Framework. We are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. We cannot, however, be certain that any measures we undertake will successfully remediate the material weakness or that other material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be discovered in the future. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or on a timely basis, which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated and result in the loss of investor confidence or delisting and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA worsening of economic conditions or a decrease in consumer spending may substantially decrease our revenues and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy.\nTo a significant extent, our success depends on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. While economic conditions have been improving, there is no certainty that this trend will continue or that credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not deteriorate again. Accordingly, we may experience declines in revenue during economic turmoil or during periods of uncertainty. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending, leading cost-conscious consumers to be more selective in restaurants visited, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, business, and financial condition.\nThe challenges of competing with the many food services businesses may result in reductions in our revenue and operating margins.\nWe compete with many well-established companies, food service and otherwise, on the basis of taste, quality and price of product offered, customer service, atmosphere, location and overall consumer experience. Our success depends, in part, upon the popularity of our products and our ability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all four day-parts. Shifts in consumer preferences away from our products, our inability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all day-parts, or changes in our menu that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business. We compete with other smoothie and juice bar retailers, specialty coffee retailers, yogurt and ice cream shops, bagel shops, fast-food restaurants, delicatessens, caf\u00e9s, take-out food service companies, supermarkets and convenience stores. Our competitors change with each of the four day-parts, ranging from coffee bars and bakery caf\u00e9s to casual dining chains. Many of our competitors, or potential competitors, have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in the market quicker than we can. In addition, aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets, could reduce our revenue and operating margins.\nWe are subject to risks associated with climate change and climate change regulation.\nLaws and regulations regarding climate change, energy usage and emissions controls may impact the Company directly through higher cost of goods. The potential impacts of climate change and climate change regulations are highly uncertain at this time, and the Company cannot anticipate or predict the material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as a result of climate change and climate change regulations. For instance, changes in the prevailing climates may result in a reduction in, or increased prices of available produce, which may adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.\nOur revenue is subject to volatility based on weather and varies by season.\nSeasonal factors cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Because the majority of our revenue results from the sale of smoothies, our revenue is typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season, and during periods of inclement weather (because fewer people choose cold beverages) and higher during the spring, summer and fall months (for the opposite reason).\nFluctuations in various food and supply costs, particularly produce and dairy, could adversely affect our operating results.\nSupplies and prices of the various products that we use to prepare our offerings can be affected by a variety of factors, such as weather, seasonal fluctuations, demand, politics and economics in the producing countries. These factors subject us to shortages or interruptions in product supplies, which could adversely affect our revenue and profits. In addition, the prices of fruit and dairy, which are the main products in our offerings, can be highly volatile. The quality of produce we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis, depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase. An increase in pricing of any produce that we use in our products could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, higher diesel and gasoline prices may affect our supply or transportation costs and may affect our profitability. Although we attempt to mitigate the risks of volatile commodity prices and allow greater predictability in pricing by entering into fixed price, or to-be-fixed price, purchase commitments for a portion of our produce and dairy requirements, we cannot assure you that these activities will be successful or that they will not result in our paying substantially more for our produce supply than would have been required absent such activities. Declines in sales may also adversely affect our business to the extent we have long-term purchase commitments in excess of our needs.\nWe are dependent upon a limited number of distributors for a significant amount of our food distribution for our Stores.\nFor Company Stores, we maintain food distribution contracts primarily with two regional distributors, Systems Services of America (\u201cSSA\u201d) and Gordon Food Services (\u201cGFS\u201d), that also service a majority of our Franchise Stores. SSA distributes to the Western United States, and GFS primarily distributes to the Eastern United States. Although we believe our relationship with these distributors will result in increased operational efficiencies and cost savings, we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that we will not have to pay substantially more for distributor services in the event GFS or SSA has operational problems. Should GFS or SSA have operational problems, our operations and our operating margins could be adversely affected.\nWe may face difficulties entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or new service providers.\nIf we expand our operations into new geographic areas through new Company Stores, Franchise Stores and/or the JambaGO\u00ae platform, or introduce new products with special manufacture, storage or distribution requirements, we may have to seek new suppliers and service providers, or enter into new arrangements with existing ones. We may also encounter difficulties or be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms as favorable as those we currently enjoy, which could harm our business and operating results. For example, the potential growth in smaller format stores may cause the frequency of shipments to increase and the average number of cases per shipment to decrease, thereby increasing the Company\u2019s per case shipment costs.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on the value of the Jamba Juice brands.\nThe Jamba Juice\u00ae brand practice is to inspire and simplify healthy living. We believe we must preserve and grow the value of the Jamba Juice brands in order to be successful in building our business, and particularly in building a consumer products growth platform under the Jamba brands. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, and the Jamba Juice brand has been highly rated in several recent brand studies. We intend to reinforce and extend these perceptions for the Jamba brands to help support our licensing efforts. Our brand building initiatives involve increasing our product offerings, opening new Franchise Stores, expanding the JambaGO\u00ae and Jamba Smoothie Station\u2122 platforms and entering into licensing arrangements to increase awareness of our brands and create and maintain brand loyalty. Our franchisees and licensees are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages, food and other products directly to customers. We provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial pressures. We believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our franchisees and licensees as they do from us. Any shortcoming of one of our business partners, particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience or the safety of beverages or food, may be attributed by customers to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our results of operations. If our brand building initiatives are unsuccessful, or if business incidents occur that erode consumer perceptions of our brand, then the value of our products may diminish and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nWe may experience higher than anticipated costs in connection with the refresh and remodel of existing Company Stores.\nUpdating the format and design of our Company Stores is important to maintaining a positive consumer association with the Jamba Juice brand. While we intend for such remodeling efforts to inure to the benefit of the Company, the associated costs may be higher than expected, and our revenues and expenses could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. Our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to build further brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logos and the unique ambiance of our stores, both domestically and overseas. We have secured the ownership and rights to our marks in the United States and have filed or obtained registrations in select classes including restaurant services in most other significant foreign jurisdictions. We undertake similar efforts to protect our brands in other relevant consumer product categories in relevant jurisdictions. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our store brand and our consumer products brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we have not encountered material claims from prior users of intellectual property relating to restaurant services in areas where we operate or intend to conduct material operations in the near future, there can be no assurances that we will not encounter any material claims in the future. If so, this could harm our image, brands or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased labor or healthcare costs. Self-insurance plan claims could materially impact our results.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We compete with other employers in our markets for hourly workers and may become subject to higher labor costs as a result of such competition. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our team members. A considerable number of the team members employed by us are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage. In 2009, the federal minimum wage increased to $7.25 per hour. Additionally, many of our Company Store team members work in stores located in states where the minimum wage is greater than the federal minimum wage and receive compensation equal to the state\u2019s minimum wage. The current California minimum wage is $9.00 per hour, and it will increase to $10.00 per hour effective January 1, 2016.\nMoreover, municipalities may set minimum wages above the applicable state standards, such as in San Francisco, which raised the minimum wage to $11.05 per hour as of January 1, 2015. Any further increases in the federal minimum wage or the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases where our employees may be located will increase our labor costs. Competition for employees in various markets could also result in higher required wage rates. Furthermore, the Company is self-insured for employee healthcare and dental benefits. The Company pays a substantial part of the healthcare benefits for team members at the general manager level and above and for those working at the Company\u2019s corporate office. The Company has a retrospective policy for its Worker\u2019s Compensation risks. Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated in part, by considering historical claims experience, reserves and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities are based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as the Company\u2019s actual historical trends. If actual claims experience differs from the Company\u2019s assumptions, historical trends, and estimates, changes in the Company\u2019s insurance reserves could materially impact our results of operations.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by Congress and state legislatures may have a material adverse impact on our business. We are currently evaluating the future impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on our business. Due to provisions requiring phasing-in over time, changes to our healthcare costs structure could have a significant, negative impact on our future business.\nWe are reliant on our outsourcing partner to provide effective administrative functions.\nDuring the latter part of 2014, we engaged a third party service provider to provide outsourced accounting, IT, human resources, and contract management services. This allowed us to achieve efficiencies and cost savings, in part, through a reduction in our workforce. If our outsourcing partner fails to perform at a sufficient level to ensure our efficient operation, we may not have the resources to timely and efficiently take over those functions, and our financial performance might be adversely impacted as a result.\nWe are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.\nWe, and our franchisees, compete in the market for real estate and our, or their, inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease terms could impact our respective abilities to grow. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 15 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments if at all. We generally cannot cancel these leases. If an existing or new store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, as we have done in the past and may do in the future, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Additionally, because we sublease the premises of Company Stores sold to franchisees in our refranchising program, we are still legally liable to the landlords under the prime leases, and we will need to assume obligations under the prime lease should a franchisee default on its sublease obligations. Current locations of our stores and franchised locations may become unattractive as demographic patterns change. In addition, as each of our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could require us to close stores in desirable locations.\nOur business and results may be subject to disruption from work stoppages, terrorism or natural disasters.\nOur operations may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, flooding or other natural disasters. These disruptions can result in, among other things, lost sales when consumers stay home or are physically prevented from reaching our stores, property damage, lost sales when our stores are forced to close for extended periods of time and interruptions in supply when vendors suffer damages or transportation is affected. In addition, our corporate offices and support center is located in Northern California near known earthquake fault lines. If a major earthquake or other natural disaster were to occur in Northern California, our corporate offices and support center may be damaged or destroyed. Such a disruption could result in the temporary or permanent loss of critical data, suspension of operations, delays in shipments of product, and disruption of business in both the affected region and nationwide, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe unexpected loss of one or more members of our executive management team could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our executive management team and other key employees. We believe that these individuals understand our operational strategies and priorities and the steps necessary to drive our long-term growth and stockholder value. Competition for personnel in our industry is strong and the ability to retain key employees during a revitalization effort can be difficult. While we have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers, we cannot make any assurances that we can retain these individuals for the period necessary for us to achieve and sustain profitability. Our failure to continue to recruit, retain, and motivate executive management and other key employees sufficient to maintain a competitive position within our industry and to implement our strategic priorities would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on the financial performance of stores concentrated in certain geographic areas.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on stores located in California. Stores located in California comprise over 87% of Company Stores and generate a significant portion of our Company Store revenue. These stores also comprise over 26% of our total global system stores. In recent years, California and other states have experienced significant negative economic impact due to the distressed economic climate. If geographic regions in which we have a high concentration of stores experience significant economic pressures, our sales and operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, state and local laws, government regulations, weather conditions and natural disasters affecting California and other regions where we have a high concentration of stores may have a material impact upon our operating results.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments, or we may not realize them in the time frame expected. Future acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments may require us to issue additional equity securities, spend a substantial portion of our available cash, or incur debt or liabilities, amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.\nGovernmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.\nWe, and our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state and local regulations. Each of our stores is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, food and workplace safety and other agencies. We, and our franchisees, may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new stores, which could delay planned store openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations.\nOur operations are also subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters. In recent years, there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry. Establishments operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments have been a particular focus, and compliance with additional regulations can become costly and affect our operating results.\nOur federal, state and local tax returns may, from time to time, be selected for audit by the taxing authorities, which may result in tax assessments, interest or penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the U.S. In making tax estimates and paying taxes, significant judgment is often required. Although we believe our tax positions and estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the Company, we could have an additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. If material, payment of such additional amounts could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely heavily on information technology and a material failure of that technology could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.\nOur business operations rely heavily on information systems, including point-of-sale processing in our stores, management of our supply chain and distribution system, vendor and franchisee invoicing, and various other processes and procedures. The efficient management of our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems, and any related failure and/or breach of security could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.\nFailure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of customers, vendors or employees could expose us to data loss, litigation and liability, and our reputation could be significantly harmed.\nOur business operations require us to process and/or maintain certain personal, business and financial information about customers, vendors and employees. The use of such information by us is regulated by federal, state and foreign laws, as well as certain third party agreements. If our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation and result in litigation and settlement costs, damage awards, or penalties and fines. As privacy and information security law and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance.\nA failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyber-attacks could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nInformation security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error or accidental technological failure. These threats include cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches.\nTo date, we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. Any actual attacks could lead to damage to our reputation, additional costs (such as repairing systems and investigation or compliance costs), penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FRANCHISE BUSINESS\nOur growth strategy depends on increasing franchise ownership.\nOur current growth strategy is to transition to an asset-light business model, including selling Company Stores, and increasing the number of franchise locations as a percentage of all stores in the Jamba System. By emphasizing Franchise Store development, we receive an increasingly significant amount of our revenues in the form of royalties from our franchisees. Accordingly, the success of our business is increasingly dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. This strategy is subject to risks and uncertainties. While our franchise agreements set forth certain operational standards and guidelines, we have limited control over how our franchisees\u2019 businesses are run, and any significant inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments. We may not be able to identify franchisee candidates with appropriate experience and financial resources or to negotiate mutually acceptable agreements with those that do. Our franchisee candidates may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open or continue operating the stores contemplated by their franchise agreements with us. In addition, franchisees may not be able to find suitable sites on which to develop new stores or negotiate acceptable lease terms for the sites, obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules. If our franchisees incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt, it could result in financial distress or even possible insolvency or bankruptcy. Some of our franchisees experienced financial pressures during fiscal 2014. If a significant number of our franchisees become financially distressed, this could harm our operating results through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable.\nOur refranchising initiative involves risks that could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn November 2014, as part of our transition to an asset-light business model, we announced a refranchising initiative that includes the sale of up to 114 Company Stores in the California market. We anticipate completing the sales of these stores during 2015. There are a number of risks associated with this initiative, including the difficulty in predicting the ultimate costs, and sales price, associated with the sale of these Company Stores, including employee termination costs, the timing of payments received, the results of negotiations with landlords, the impact of the sale of Company Stores on ongoing operations, any tax impact from the sale of Company Sores, and the future impact to our financial results. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nExpansion into new geographic markets may present increased risks.\nFranchise growth is planned in new geographic areas in the United States and select international markets for fiscal 2015. Our future results, and the results of new Franchise Stores, depend on various factors, including successful selection and expansion into these new geographic markets and market acceptance of the Jamba Juice experience. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns as compared to existing markets. As a result, those new stores may be less successful than stores in our existing markets. Consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the Jamba Juice brand, and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned. Franchisees may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision, passion and culture. Stores opened in new markets may also have lower average store revenue than stores opened in existing markets, and may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs than stores in existing markets. Furthermore, we may have difficulty in finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us, either initially or over time, with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards. Revenue at stores opened in new markets may take longer to increase and reach expected revenue levels, and may never do so, thereby affecting our overall royalty income. As with the experience of other retail food concepts that have tried to expand nationally and internationally, we may find that the Jamba Juice concept has limited appeal to customers in new markets or we may experience a decline in the popularity of the Jamba Juice experience. Newly opened stores may not succeed, future markets and stores may not be successful and, even if we are successful, our average store revenue, and the royalty income generated therefrom, may not increase and may even decline.\nOur efforts to expand internationally may not be successful and could impair the value of our brand.\nOur current strategy includes international expansion in a number of countries around the world. Expanding into international markets will expose us to new risks and uncertainties, including product supply, import/export limitations and regulations to which we are not currently bound and may not be currently set up to handle, consumer preferences, occupancy costs, operating expenses and labor and infrastructure challenges. If stores open in international markets and such stores are unable to source inventory locally, franchisees may be required to import inventory from our U.S. distributors and any resulting import duties, tariffs, transportation or other charges may disproportionately impact such stores\u2019 cost of goods which could harm the viability of such stores. Finally, international operations have inherent risks such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the application and effect of local laws and regulations and enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights. Additionally, effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand into new international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. Failure of our international expansion strategy could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nTermination or non-renewal of franchise agreements may disrupt store performance.\nEach franchise agreement is subject to termination by us in the event of default by the franchisee after the applicable cure period. Upon the expiration of the initial term of a franchise agreement, the franchisee generally has an option to renew for an additional term. There is no assurance that franchisees will meet the criteria for renewal or will desire or be able to renew their franchise agreements. If not renewed, a franchise agreement and payments required thereunder will terminate. We may be unable to find a new franchisee to replace such lost revenue. Furthermore, while we will be entitled to terminate franchise agreements following a default that is not cured within the applicable cure period, if any, the disruption to the performance of the stores could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur franchisees could take actions that harm our reputation and reduce our royalty revenue.\nWhile we have franchise agreements in place with our franchisees that provide certain operational requirements, we do not exercise control over the day-to-day operations of our Franchise Stores. Any operational or developmental shortcomings of our Franchise Stores, including their failure to comply with applicable laws, are likely to be attributed to our system-wide operations in the eyes of consumers and could adversely affect our reputation and have a direct negative impact on the royalty revenue we receive from those and other stores.\nWe could face liability from our franchisees and from government agencies.\nA franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisor/franchisee relationship. Various state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be liable for damages to franchisees, fines or other penalties. Expensive litigation with our franchisees or government agencies may adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our franchisees.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE FOOD SERVICE BUSINESS\nLitigation and publicity concerning food quality, health claims, and other issues can result in liabilities, increased expenses, distraction of management, and can also cause customers to avoid our products, which could adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial condition.\nFood service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from food quality, health claims, allergens, illness, injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one retail location or a number of retail locations. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging customers from buying our products.\nOur customers occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our stores, or that we have problems with food quality or operations. We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including false advertising claims, personal injury claims, contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage, or for which we are not covered by insurance, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects, which in turn, could adversely affect our results.\nIn addition, the food services industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products they sell, and disclosure and advertising practices. We may also be subject to this type of proceeding in the future and, even if not, publicity about these matters (particularly directed at the quick-service and fast-casual segments of the industry) may harm our reputation or prospects and adversely affect our results.\nWe are also impacted by trends in litigation, including class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection laws, securities and derivative lawsuits claiming violations of state and federal securities law, and employee lawsuits, including wage and hour claims. We may also be impacted by litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employee claims based on, among other things, wage and hour violations, discrimination, harassment, or wrongful termination, as these types of claims are increasingly asserted against franchisors on a co-employer theory by employees of franchisees.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, these proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that we devote substantial resources to defend our Company and could affect the future premiums we would be required to pay on our insurance policies. Further, changes in governmental regulations could have adverse effects on our business and subject us to additional regulatory actions.\nFood safety concerns and instances of food-borne illnesses could harm our customers, result in negative publicity and cause the temporary closure of some stores and, in some cases, could adversely affect the price and availability of fruits and vegetables, any of which could harm our brand reputation, result in a decline in revenue or an increase in costs.\nWe consider food safety a top priority and dedicate substantial resources toward ensuring that our customers enjoy high-quality, safe and wholesome products. However, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food-borne illnesses. Furthermore, our reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents (such as e. coli, hepatitis A, salmonella or listeria) could occur outside of our control and at multiple locations. Instances of food-borne illnesses, whether real or perceived, and whether at our stores or those of our competitors, could harm customers and otherwise result in negative publicity about us or the products we serve, which could adversely affect revenue. If there is an incident involving our stores serving contaminated products, our customers may be harmed, our revenue may decrease and our brand name and reputation may be impaired. If our customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some stores. In addition, we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of making any such changes and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors. Food safety concerns and instances of food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by food contamination have in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause customers to shift their preferences, particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers. As a result, our costs may increase and our revenue may decline. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our stores, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK\nFailure of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes: (i) maintaining reasonably detailed records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; and (ii) providing reasonable assurance that we (a) record transactions as necessary to prepare the financial statements, (b) make receipts and expenditures in accordance with management authorizations, and (c) would timely prevent or detect any unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure could cause an immediate loss of investor confidence in us and a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock. As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to identifying and accounting for non-standard transactions.\nOur anti-takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change of control of us, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change of control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. For example, the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include anti-takeover provisions such as:\n\u00b7 limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend our charter documents, including stockholder supermajority voting requirements;\n\u00b7 the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call a special meeting absent the request of the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock; and\n\u00b7 advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals.\nThe Company is also afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which prevents it from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of its common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless board of directors or stockholder approval is obtained.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors. The stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. Broad market factors, including the effect of international political instability, armed conflict, natural disasters, financial markets, and general economic conditions, may have a material adverse effect on our stock price, regardless of our actual performance.", "PERMNO": 90795, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "JMBA"}
