{"cik": "1368365", "company": "Remark Media, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this 2015 Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nIf we are unable to attract and retain visitors to our owned and operated websites and mobile applications in a cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur primary strategy for attracting and retaining users to our websites and mobile applications is to provide content and community-focused digital experiences. The success of these efforts depends, in part, upon our ability to create and distribute high-quality content as well as to innovate and evolve our content and social media technology platforms at scale in a cost-effective manner. Failure to do so could adversely affect user experiences and reduce traffic to our owned-and-operated websites and mobile applications, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our strategy could be flawed and might not result in the ability to attract and retain users in a cost-effective manner. A second strategy we utilize to attract traffic is search engine optimization related to our websites and the content published on them, a strategy that involves building websites with the objective of having them rank well in unpaid search engine results. Our ability to successfully manage search engine optimization efforts across our owned-and-operated websites is dependent on our timely and effective modification of search engine optimization practices implemented in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms and methodologies and changes in search query trends and our ability to offer websites and content responsive to ever-changing consumer interests and trends. Our failure to successfully manage our search engine optimization strategy could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our owned-and-operated websites, or an inability to attract traffic to new websites that we launch which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEven if we succeed in attracting traffic to our owned-and-operated websites, we may not be successful in monetizing the traffic. Additionally, the costs of attracting and retaining users to our websites may exceed our ability to generate revenues from such activities, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur travel and entertainment business is dependent on providers of travel and entertainment products.\nOur travel and entertainment business (including the operations of our Vegas.com and Roomlia subsidiaries) relies on providers of travel and entertainment products (including lodging, air travel, show tickets and tours) to make their products available to consumers through us. Our arrangements with such providers generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of such products, or to make such products available at any particular price. A significant reduction on the part of any of our major providers, or providers that are particularly popular with consumers, in their participation in our services for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFinancial Statement Index\nOur travel business derives a significant portion of its revenues from the Las Vegas market and is especially subject to certain risks, including economic and competitive risks, associated with conditions in the Las Vegas area.\nBecause our Vegas.com subsidiary provides travel and entertainment booking services in the Las Vegas market exclusively, we are subject to greater risks from conditions in the Las Vegas area than travel booking companies that are more geographically diversified. Risks from conditions in the Las Vegas area include the following:\n\u2022\nlocal economic and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nreduced land and air travel due to increasing fuel costs or transportation disruptions;\n\u2022\ninaccessibility of the area due to inclement weather, natural disasters, road construction or closure of primary access routes;\n\u2022\nthe outbreak of public health threats in the area or the perception that such threats exist; and\n\u2022\na decline in the number of visitors.\nOur travel business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer and corporate spending.\nExpenditures on travel and entertainment and leisure activities are sensitive to personal and business-related discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns. Changes in discretionary spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, high unemployment, perceived or actual changes in disposable consumer income and wealth, higher fuel or other transportation costs, or changes in consumer confidence could reduce demand for our services, which could adversely affect our travel business and our overall business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDeclines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our travel business.\nThe success and financial performance of our travel business are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry. Our business is sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply, occupancy and average daily rates, decreases in airline capacity, periodically rising airline ticket prices, or the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, all of which we have experienced historically.\nOther factors that could negatively affect our business include:\n\u2022\nair fare increases;\n\u2022\ncontinued consolidation of air carriers and hotel providers;\n\u2022\ntravel-related strikes or labor unrest, bankruptcies or liquidations;\n\u2022\nincidents of actual or threatened terrorism;\n\u2022\nperiods of political instability or geopolitical conflict in which travelers become concerned about safety issues;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or events such as severe weather conditions, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes or earthquakes; and\n\u2022\nhealth-related risks, such as the Ebola, H1N1, SARs and avian flu outbreaks.\nSuch concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services which, depending on its scope and duration and together with any future issues affecting travel safety, could adversely affect our business over the short and long-term. In addition, the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events, such as severe weather conditions, actual or threatened terrorist activity or war, could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with hotel reservations and other travel products and services.\nAs a creator and a distributor of digital content, we face potential liability for legal claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we create or distribute, or that are accessible via our owned-and-operated websites.\nAs a creator and distributor of original content and content provided by third parties, we face potential liability for legal claims, including defamation, negligence, unlawful practice of a licensed profession, copyright or trademark infringement or other legal theories relating to the information we publish on our websites, and under various laws, including the Lanham Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Copyright Act. We may also be exposed to similar liability in connection with content that is posted to our owned-and-operated websites by users and other third parties through comments, profile pages, discussion forums and other social media features. In addition, it is also possible that visitors to our owned-and-operated websites could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance upon information provided on our owned-and-operated websites. Any of these claims could result in significant costs to investigate and defend, regardless of the merit of the claims. If we are not successful in our defense, we may be forced to pay substantial damages. While we run our content through a rigorous quality control process, there is no guarantee that we will avoid future liability and potential expenses for legal claims, which could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLaws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their advertisers and for the content of their advertisers\u2019 listings are currently unsettled. Such claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services as well as other print publications in the past. We may not successfully avoid liability for unlawful activities carried out by advertisers displayed on our websites. If we are subjected to such lawsuits, it may adversely affect our business.\nWe are vulnerable to failures of third-party network and technology providers who may fail to provide adequate services in the future. This could cause technical problems or failure of our websites or traffic, which could inhibit our revenues or damage our reputation and relationships with users, advertisers, and content providers.\nWe rely on many third-party businesses for technological, network, and expert services. Our ability to operate successfully depends on the successful operation of these third party businesses, which carry their own risks. If one of our third party vendors fails to deliver expected services, our websites and, therefore, our business could suffer operating problems or temporary failures. If there is a problem or failure with our websites, it could hurt our ability to advertise and damage our reputation with consumers and advertisers. Additionally, a termination of our hosting agreements or failure to renew on favorable terms could affect our business. Shifting hosting services could require management focus and time and potentially disrupt operations of our websites.\nIn addition, as operators of content websites reliant on user traffic to sell advertising, our users must have adequate and functioning Internet access. Technical problems with Internet access providers such as cable, DSL satellite or mobile companies may inhibit user access to our websites and slow traffic. Such events as power outages caused by blackouts, brown outs, storm outages or other power issues could also cause loss of user access to our websites.\nWe process, store and use personal information, payment card information and other consumer data, which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations.\nWe may acquire personal or confidential information from users of our websites and mobile applications, and we have posted our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data on such websites and mobile applications.\nNumerous laws exist regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information, payment card information and other consumer data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection; however, these obligations may possibly be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, and they may conflict with other rules or with our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us, or our service providers, to comply with the privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information, payment card information or other consumer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against the company by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers and members to lose trust in us, as well as subject us to bank fines, penalties or increased transaction costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the Internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d)and the Department of Commerce, are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. Some U.S. courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes, including computer trespass and wiretapping laws, to the collection and exchange of information online. Countries in other regions, most notably Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, are increasingly implementing new privacy regulations, resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted.\nOur network operations may be vulnerable to hacking, viruses and other disruptions, which may make our products and services less attractive and reliable and give rise to liabilities.\nOur marketplaces and information technology platform generate and process a large quantity of personal, transactional, demographic and behavioral data. The security of data when engaging in e-commerce is essential to maintaining consumer confidence in our services. Any security breach whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other Internet based systems could significantly harm our reputation and therefore our business, brand, market share and results of operations. We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or accounts. It is possible that computer circumvention capabilities, new discoveries or advances or other developments, including our own acts or omissions, could result in a compromise or breach of consumer data. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose user names, passwords or other sensitive information (\u201cphishing\u201d), which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems or to defraud our customers.\nOur existing security measures may not be successful in preventing security breaches. A party (whether internal, external, an affiliate or unrelated third party) that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal consumer information or transaction data or other proprietary information and cause disruptions in our service. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused and liabilities incurred by breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced. Security breaches could result in severe damage to our information technology infrastructure, including damage that could impair our ability to offer our services, as well as loss of customer, financial or other data that could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, satisfy our commercial obligations or meet our public reporting requirements in a timely fashion or at all. Security breaches could also result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions, or cause consumers to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the services of our competitors, any of which would have a negative effect on the value of our brand, our market share and our results of operations. Our insurance policies carry low coverage limits, and would likely not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nWe also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties conducting business over the Internet. Consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy on the Internet, and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet and negatively affect consumers' willingness to provide private information or effect commercial transactions on the Internet generally, including through our services. Additionally, consumers using our services could be affected by security breaches at third parties such as travel service providers, payroll providers, health plan providers, payment processors or GDSs upon which we rely. A security breach at any such third party marketing affiliate, travel service provider, GDS or other third party on which we rely could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of our systems and in any event could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions. In addition, such third parties may not comply with applicable disclosure requirements, which could expose us to liability.\nWe are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.\nAdditionally, in December 2013, we converted from hardware storage in data room to a cloud-based infrastructure. Like many companies using the cloud, we continually strive to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business. We continuously perform vulnerability assessments, review log/access, perform system maintenance, and manage network perimeter protection. A breach of external perimeter may lead to the loss of confidential information.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software, including software developed or maintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products, delay product introductions or enhancements, result in measurement or billing errors, or compromise our ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property. Any errors, bugs, or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe successful operation of our KanKan mobile application will depend upon the performance and reliability of the Internet infrastructure in China.\nThe successful operation of KanKan will depend on the performance and reliability of the Internet infrastructure in China. Almost all access to the Internet is maintained through state-owned telecommunication operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China. In addition, the national networks in China are connected to the Internet through state-owned international gateways, which are the only channels through which a domestic user can connect to the Internet outside of China. We may not have access to alternative networks in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with China\u2019s Internet infrastructure. In addition, the Internet infrastructure in China may not support the demands associated with continued growth in Internet usage.\nThe failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the requisite bandwidth could also interfere with the speed and availability of KanKan. We have no control over the costs of the services provided by the national telecommunications operators. If the prices that we pay for telecommunications and Internet services rise significantly, our gross margins could be adversely affected. In addition, if Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, our user traffic may decrease, which in turn may cause a decrease in our revenues.\nWe may be subject to liability in China with respect to KanKan for content that is alleged to be socially destabilizing, obscene, defamatory, libelous or otherwise unlawful.\nUnder the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China, we will be required to monitor our websites and the websites hosted on our servers and mobile interfaces for items or content deemed to be socially destabilizing, obscene, superstitious or defamatory, as well as items, content or services that are illegal to sell online or otherwise in other jurisdictions in which we operate, and promptly take appropriate action with respect to such items, content or services. We may also be subject to potential liability in China for any unlawful actions of our customers or users of our websites or mobile interfaces or for content we distribute that is deemed inappropriate. It may be difficult to determine the type of content that may result in liability to us, and if we are found to be liable, we may be subject to fines, have our relevant business operation licenses revoked, or be prevented from operating our websites or mobile interfaces in China.\nUnauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.\nWe regard our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may adversely affect our business and reputation. We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, business partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our precautions, it is possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization. Furthermore, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of\nintellectual property in Internet related industries are uncertain and still evolving. In particular, the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China are uncertain or do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Moreover, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Future litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses and, if determined adversely against us, materially disrupt our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our brands and services will not infringe valid patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We cannot provide assurance that we will avoid the need to defend against allegations of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit. Intellectual property litigation is very expensive, and becoming involved in such litigation could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win. Substantially greater resources may allow some of our competitors to sustain the cost of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than us; we may not be able to afford the cost of such litigation.\nShould we suffer an adverse outcome from intellectual property litigation, we may incur significant liabilities, we may be required to license disputed rights from third parties, or we may have to cease using the subject technology. If we are found to infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights, we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses to such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or obtain alternative technology. If we fail to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, such failure may materially disrupt the conduct of our business, and could consume substantial resources and create significant uncertainties. Any legal action against us or our collaborators could lead to:\n\u2022\npayment of actual damages, royalties, lost profits, potentially treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent rights;\n\u2022\ninjunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell our products;\n\u2022\nus or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all; or\n\u2022\nsignificant cost and expense, as well as distraction of our management from our business.\nThe negative outcomes discussed above could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew regulations governing the Internet and e-commerce may negatively affect our business.\nAny new legislation or regulation, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet or other online services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, and financial conditions and results of operations.\nIn 2013, the FTC issued a letter reiterating the guidance it issued in 2002, which recommended that all search engine companies ensure that all paid search results are clearly distinguished from non-paid results, that the use of paid search is clearly and conspicuously explained and disclosed and that other disclosures are made to avoid misleading users about the possible effects of paid search listings on search results. The adoption of laws or regulations relating to placement of paid search advertisements or user privacy, defamation or taxation may inhibit the growth in use of the Internet, which in turn, could decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe application of new and existing laws and regulations to the Internet or other online services has had a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations in the past. For example, on April 17, 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1677, The Taxpayer Protection Act of 2007 (\u201cH.R. 1677\u201d). Section 8 of H.R. 1677 would have amended Section 333, Title 31 of the U.S. Code to include Internet domain addresses in the prohibition on certain use of the U.S. Department of the Treasury names and symbols. Although the legislation was never passed by the Senate or\nsigned into law and the bill ceased with the ending of the 110th Congress in January 2009, there is no guarantee that similar legislation won\u2019t be introduced and passed into law by the current or future Congress. While the ultimate impact of any such proposed legislation is not presently determinable, if enacted, such legislation may adversely impact our overall operations. We own the Internet domain address US Tax Center at www.irs.com, which is an acronym commonly associated with the Internal Revenue Service, a division of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. While the bill was never passed into law, if enacted, the passage of such legislation could have severely adversely affected our use of our Internet domain address US Tax Center at www.irs.com as well as our overall operations. In the event a bill such as H.R. 1677 were to become law, we intend to continue to be diligent in our communications with the Internal Revenue Service and Congress in an effort to mitigate any potential negative effects of such legislation.\nWe face intense competition from larger, more established companies, and we may not be able to compete effectively, which could reduce demand for our services.\nThe market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive. Nearly all our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our competitors may secure more favorable revenue arrangements with advertisers, devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive growth strategies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we do. In addition, the Internet media and advertising industries continue to experience consolidation, including the acquisitions of companies offering travel and finance-related content and services and paid search services. Industry consolidation has resulted in larger, more established and well-financed competitors with a greater focus. If these industry trends continue, or if we are unable to compete in the Internet media and paid search markets, our financial results may suffer.\nAdditionally, larger companies may implement policies and/or technologies into their search engines or software that make it less likely that consumers can reach our websites and less likely that consumers will click-through on sponsored listings from our advertisers. The implementation of such technologies could result in a decrease in our revenues. If we are unable to successfully compete against current and future competitors, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth, our operating performance will suffer and our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSubstantial future growth will be required in order for us to realize our business objectives. To the extent we are capable of achieving this growth, it will place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. Additionally, this growth will require us to make significant capital expenditures, hire, train and manage a larger work force, and allocate valuable management resources. We must manage any such growth through appropriate systems and controls in each of these areas. If we do not manage the growth of our business effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, as our business grows, our technological and network infrastructure must keep in-line with our traffic and advertiser needs. Future demand is difficult to forecast and we may not be able to adequately handle large increases unless we spend substantial amounts to augment our ability to handle increased traffic. Additionally, the implementation of increased network capacity contains some execution risks and may lead to ineffectiveness or inefficiency. This could lead to a diminished experience for our consumers and advertisers and damage our reputation and relationship with them, leading to lower marketability and negative effects on our operating results. Moreover, the pace of innovative change in network technology is fast and if we do not keep up, we may lag behind competitors. The costs of upgrading and improving technology could be substantial and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to our Company\nWe have a history of operating losses and we may not generate sufficient revenue to support our operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, and in each fiscal year since our inception, we have incurred net losses and generated negative cash flow from operations, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $161.4 million.\nWe believe that the Vegas.com Acquisition (as described in Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) will provide us with additional revenue sources, but we cannot provide assurance that revenue generated from Vegas.com or our\nother businesses will be sufficient to sustain our operations in the long term. We have implemented measures to reduce operating costs, and we continuously evaluate other opportunities to reduce costs. Additionally, we are actively assessing the sale of certain non-core assets, considering sales of minority interests in certain of our operating businesses, and evaluating potential acquisitions that would provide additional revenue. However, we may need to obtain additional capital through equity financing, debt financing, or by divesting of certain assets or businesses.\nConditions in the debt and equity markets, as well as the volatility of investor sentiment regarding macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions, will play primary roles in determining whether we can successfully obtain additional capital. We cannot be certain that we will be successful at raising capital, whether in an equity financing, debt financing, or by divesting of certain assets or businesses, on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, if we obtain capital by issuing equity, such transaction(s) may dilute existing stockholders.\nAdditionally, in connection with the Vegas.com Acquisition, we entered into a financing agreement dated as of September 24, 2015 (the \u201cFinancing Agreement\u201d) with certain of our subsidiaries as borrowers (together with Remark, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d), certain of our subsidiaries as guarantors (the \u201cGuarantors\u201d), the lenders from time to time party thereto (the \u201cLenders\u201d) and MGG Investment Group LP, in its capacity as collateral agent and administrative agent for the Lenders (\u201cMGG\u201d), pursuant to which the Lenders extended credit to the Borrowers consisting of a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $27,500,000 (the \u201cLoan\u201d). The Financing Agreement contains limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt and transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, without the consent of the Lenders. Should we fail to successfully implement our plans described herein, such failure would have a material adverse effect on our business, including the possible cessation of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness and other payment obligations could adversely affect our financial health.\nWe have outstanding principal indebtedness of $27.5 million under the Loan. The Loan amount outstanding accrues interest at the three-month LIBOR (with a floor of 1%) plus 10.0% per annum, payable monthly, and the Loan has a maturity date of September 24, 2018. The Loan is secured by a first-priority lien on, and security interest in, all assets of Remark and our subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Financing Agreement and related documents also provide for certain fees payable to the Lenders, including a $2.0 million exit fee, and for the issuance of a five-year warrant to purchase shares of our common stock providing the holder with the right to sell the warrant back to Remark on its expiration date in exchange for $3.0 million in cash (reduced pro rata based on the percentage of the warrant exercised).\nOur substantial indebtedness and other payment obligations could have important consequences to our stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for working capital and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to a general economic downturn than a company that is less leveraged.\nThe Financing Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nThe Financing Agreement requires us to satisfy various covenants, including financial covenants with respect to quarterly EBITDA levels and the value of our assets. The Financing Agreement also contains restrictions on our abilities to engage in certain transactions without the consent of the Lenders, and may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. These restrictions include, among other things, limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets to secure debt;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another company;\n\u2022\ntransfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nengage in other businesses;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\ncreate dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries.\nOur inability to comply with the financial covenants under the Financing Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe Financing Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to financial covenants with respect to quarterly EBITDA levels and the value of our assets. At December 31, 2015, we were not in compliance with a financial covenant requiring minimum consolidated EBITDA of Remark and its subsidiaries for the four fiscal quarter period ended December 31, 2015 of ($600) thousand, as our actual consolidated EBITDA for such period was ($790) thousand, each as calculated on an annualized basis in accordance with the terms of the Financing Agreement. We obtained a waiver in March 2016 for this event. If we fail to comply with any financial covenant under the Financing Agreement going forward, under certain circumstances after a cure period, the Lender may demand the repayment of the Loan amount outstanding and unpaid interest thereon, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur Vegas.com Acquisition and any future acquisitions, business combinations and other transactions present integration risk and may have negative consequences for our business and our stockholders.\nWe completed the Vegas.com Acquisition in September 2015 and plan to continuously monitor certain strategic acquisition opportunities. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen difficulties, liabilities and costs. The Vegas.com Acquisition involves the integration of a company that had previously operated independently as a privately held company. Significant management attention and resources are required to integrate the companies, as may be the case with any future acquisitions. Difficulties that we encounter in integrating the operations of Vegas.com and other acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price following the acquisition. Even if the combined company is able to integrate the business operations successfully, there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the anticipated benefits of synergies, innovation and operational efficiencies or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time and cost effectively.\nWe continue to evolve our business strategy and develop new brands and services, and our future prospects are difficult to evaluate.\nWe are in varying stages of development with regard to our business, so our prospects must be considered in light of the many risks, uncertainties, expenses, delays, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development. Some of such risks and difficulties include our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincrease the number of users of our websites and mobile applications;\n\u2022\nmanage and implement new business strategies;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully commercialize and monetize our assets;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully attract advertisers for our owned and operated websites;\n\u2022\ncontinue to raise additional working capital;\n\u2022\nmanage operating expenses;\n\u2022\nestablish and take advantage of strategic relationships;\n\u2022\nmanage and adapt to rapidly changing and expanding operations;\n\u2022\nrespond effectively to competitive developments; and\n\u2022\nattract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nBecause of the early stage of development of certain of our business operations, we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that it will successfully address the risks described or alluded to above. Any failure by us to successfully implement our new business plans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, growth into new areas may require changes to our cost structure, modifications to our infrastructure and exposure to new regulatory, legal and competitive risks.\nIf we are not able to attract and retain key management, we may not successfully integrate the acquired assets into our historical business or achieve our other business objectives.\nWe will depend upon the contributions of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, for our future business success. The loss of the service of any of the key members of our senior management may significantly delay or prevent the integration of the contributed assets and other business objectives.\nOur investment in Sharecare\u2019s equity securities involves a substantial degree of risk.\nSharecare operates in the highly-competitive Internet industry and might not achieve profitability or consumer acceptance in the near term, if ever. Our investment in Sharecare\u2019s equity securities is illiquid and might fail to appreciate and might decline in value or become worthless. It is unlikely our Sharecare equity securities will pay current dividends, and our ability to realize a return on our investment, as well as to recover our investment, will be dependent on the success of Sharecare.\nEven if Sharecare is successful, our ability to realize the value of our investment might be limited. Because it is a private company, there is no public market for Sharecare\u2019s securities, and the Sharecare securities are subject to restrictions on resale that might prevent us from selling these securities during periods in which it would be advantageous to do so. As a result, we might have to wait for a liquidity event, such as a public offering or the sale of Sharecare, to realize the value of our investment, if any.\nSharecare may need to raise additional capital, or make additional acquisitions, and our equity position in Sharecare may be diluted if Sharecare issues additional equity, options, or warrants. If Sharecare makes a capital call of its existing equity holders, our position may be diluted if we choose not to contribute additional capital.\nHistorically, a few of our advertising networks and direct advertisers have provided a substantial portion of our revenue. The loss of one of these partners may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAs is common in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. We cannot assure you that, should agreements with our advertising networks, strategic sales and marketing partners, and/or direct advertisers fail to be renewed or should the contracts be terminated or modified in advance of their expiration, we will be able to timely replace the sponsored listings they provide us. We have had similar agreements in the past that have failed to be renewed or been modified prior to their termination, resulting in adverse effects on our financial results.\nWe could incur asset impairment charges for intangible assets or other long-lived assets.\nWe have intangible assets and other long-lived assets, therefore future lower-than-anticipated financial performance or changes in estimates and assumptions, which in many cases require significant judgment, could result in impairment charges. We test intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and assess whether factors or indicators, such as unfavorable variances from established business plans, significant changes in forecasted results or volatility inherent to external markets and industries, become apparent that would require an interim test. Adverse changes in the operating environment and related key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets or declines in the value of our common stock may result in future impairment charges for a portion or all of these assets. An impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, but would not be expected to have an impact on our cash flows or liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has fluctuated considerably and is likely to remain volatile, and various factors could negatively affect the market price or market for our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. From January 1, 2014, through March 28, 2016, the high and low sales prices for our common stock were $9.11 and $3.53, respectively. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe low trading volume and limited public market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nminimal third-party research regarding our company; and\n\u2022\nthe current and anticipated future operating performance and equity valuation of Sharecare, in which we have a significant equity investment.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership may limit individual stockholder ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of March 28, 2016, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kai-Shing Tao, may be deemed to beneficially own 7,130,634 shares, or 33.5% of our common stock, and Ashford Capital Management, Inc. may be deemed to beneficially own 1,919,416 shares, or 9.7% of our common stock. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, and might affect the prevailing market price for our securities.\nIf these stockholders act together, they may be able to exert significant control over our management and affairs requiring stockholder approval, including approval of significant corporate actions. Such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA significant number of additional shares of our common stock may be issued under the terms of existing securities, which issuances would substantially dilute existing stockholders and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nAs of March 28, 2016, we had outstanding options to purchase 4,327,653 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 12,424,485 shares of common stock. Such warrants include the warrants we issued in connection with the Vegas.com Acquisition and the Financing Agreement (referred to herein as the Acquisition Warrants and the Financing Warrant, respectively), providing for the right to purchase 8,601,410 and 2,607,796 shares of common stock, respectively, at exercise prices of $9.00 and $8.91, respectively. The Acquisition Warrants and the Financing Warrant are exercisable on a cashless basis only and therefore effectively cannot be exercised to purchase shares of common stock unless the applicable market value of the common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price under the terms thereof. However, the Acquisition Warrants also provide each holder with the right to sell its Acquisition Warrant back to us on its expiration date in exchange for shares of our common stock having a value equivalent to the value of the Acquisition Warrant at the closing of the Vegas.com Acquisition, provided that this right terminates if the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds $10.16 for any 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days at any time on or prior to the expiration date.\nThe issuance of these shares of common stock would substantially dilute the proportionate ownership and voting power of existing stockholders, and their issuance, or the possibility of their issuance, may depress the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of Remark more difficult, which acquisition may be beneficial to stockholders.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\"DGCL\"), which may discourage, delay or prevent a merger with, acquisition of or other change in control of Remark, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders, include the following:\n\u2022\nonly our Board of Directors may call special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nour stockholders may take action only at a meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nwe have authorized, undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval.\nAdditionally, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. We have not opted out of the restriction under Section 203, as permitted under DGCL.\nFurther, we have adopted a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, dated as of June 4, 2015, that generally is designed to deter any person from acquiring shares of our common stock if the acquisition would result in such person beneficially owning 4.99% or more of our common stock without the approval of our Board of Directors. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan expires on June 4, 2018.", "PERMNO": 89756, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MARK"}
