{"cik": "1108967", "company": "Orbital Energy Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Investors should read carefully the following factors as well as the cautionary statements referred to in \u2018\u2018Forward-Looking Statements\u2019\u2019 together with all of the other information in this Form 10-K. If any of the risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K actually occur, the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and/or the trading price of our common stock could decline. We also may not be able to achieve our goals or expectations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations, Services, Products and Industries We Serve\nHistorically, we have generated annual losses from operations, and we may need additional funding in the future.\nHistorically, on an annual basis, we have not generated sufficient revenues from operations to self-fund our capital and operating requirements. For the year ended 2020, we had a net loss of $27.4 million, an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020 of $149.7 million, and negative working capital of $12.3 million. If we are not able to generate sufficient income and cash flows from operations to fund our operations and growth plans, we may seek additional capital from equity and debt placements or corporate arrangements. Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or security interests in our assets. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to technologies or products. If we are unable to raise adequate funds or generate them from operations, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate some or all of our growth plans or liquidate some or all of our assets.\nThere is no assurance we will achieve or sustain profitability.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $27.4 million. There is no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability. If we fail to achieve or sustain profitability, the price of our common stock could fall and our ability to raise additional capital could be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions and strategic investments related to business expansion activities may not be successful and may divert our resources from our existing business activities, negatively affecting our operating results, cash flows and liquidity and may not enhance shareholder value.\nOrbital Energy Group has focused our business on the acquisition and development of energy infrastructure services companies including the Orbital Solar Services (formerly Reach Construction Group, LLC) acquisition, the greenfield development of Orbital Power Services and Eclipse Foundation Group and our legacy Orbital Gas Systems operations. We may not be successful in acquiring energy infrastructure services companies that are commercially viable. We may fail to successfully develop or commercialize such products, solutions and services that we acquire. Research, development and commercialization of such acquired products, solutions and services may disproportionately divert our resources from our other business activities. Acquisitions expose us to operational challenges and risks, including the ability to profitably manage and integrate acquired operations, implement internal controls, procedures, financial reporting and accounting systems into our business. In addition, increased indebtedness, earn-out obligations and cash flow requirements may result in cash flow shortages if anticipated revenue and earnings are not realized or are delayed. Other risks for acquisitions include, among other things, the ability to retain and hire qualified personnel, costs to integrate the business and fund capital needs.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investments or may have difficulty obtaining the necessary financing required to complete such acquisitions and investments. We may utilize our common stock, debt instruments, including convertible debt securities, which could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders. In addition, we may pursue acquisitions our existing shareholders may not agree with.\nWe cannot assure you that the indemnifications granted to Orbital Energy Group, Inc. by sellers of acquired companies will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset potential liabilities from acquired businesses which may have liabilities that we failed, or were unable, to discover during due diligence processes. Any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAcquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences.\nWe expect to continue to pursue acquisitions which require integration into our own business model. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions focused on energy infrastructure services. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technologies may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022\nimplementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022\ncoordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\ntransition of operations, users and customers into our existing customs;\n\u2022\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022\nretention of employees from the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resource and other administrative systems;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former shareholders, or other third parties;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures, time zones, and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the acquired technologies; and\n\u2022\nother as yet unknown risks that may impact our business.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, or reductions to our tangible net worth any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.\nWe could incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment expenses, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe have goodwill and intangible assets and will continue to as we acquire new businesses. We periodically review the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets to determine whether such carrying values exceed their fair market values. Adverse changes in financial, competitive and other conditions such as declines in operating performance or other adverse changes in valuation assumptions could adversely affect the estimated fair values of the related assets and impairment to goodwill or intangible assets. See Note 5 in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for further details.\nWe utilize debt to fund our operations and acquisitions strategy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations or could affect our ability to access capital markets in the future. Our debt may contain restrictive covenants that may prevent Orbital Energy Group from engaging in transactions that might benefit us.\nOutstanding debt and related debt service requirements could have significant consequences on our future operations including making it difficult to meet payment and other obligations. Events of default may occur if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants included with our debt agreements which could result in an acceleration of our debts becoming due and payable which would negatively impact our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and could impact our ability to obtain additional financing or limiting access to financing with reasonable terms.\nWe cannot assure that our business will generate future cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations and to fund other operational and liquidity needs.\nIn addition, regulatory changes and/or reforms, such as the phase-out of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), which is expected to occur by June 30, 2023, could lead to additional volatility in interest rates and other unpredictable effects.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings, and the need for performance and surety bonds could reduce availability of our available working capital resources.\nSome of our contracts require performance and payment bonds. If Orbital Energy Group, Inc. is unable to obtain or renew the necessary bonding capacity, we may be precluded from participation in bidding for certain contracts and from certain customers. Such bonding may require Orbital Energy Group to post letters of credit or other collateral in connection with the bonds, which could reduce our available capacity to support other needs. Standard terms in the surety market allow for sureties to issue bonds on a project-by-project basis. Sureties may decline to issue bonds at any time and can require additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds.\nChanges to laws, governmental regulations and policies, including among other things, permitting processes and tax incentives, could affect demand for our services. Demand for construction services depends on industry activity and expenditure levels which can be affected by numerous factors. An inability to adjust to such changes could result in decreased demand for our services and adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nGovernment regulations, climate change initiatives, political and social activism each effect the industries Orbital Energy Group, Inc. serves. Changes in such could result in reduced demand for our services, delays in the timing of construction projects and possible cancellation of current or planned projects. Many of our customers must comply with strict regulatory and environmental requirements along with complex permitting processes. Our energy customers are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d), among others. Our utility customers are regulated by state public utility commissions. Changes to existing, or implementation of new regulations and policies could have an adverse effect on our customers resulting in reduced demand for our services. We build renewable energy infrastructure including solar and other renewable energy projects for which the development is often dependent upon federal tax credits, existing renewable portfolio standards and other incentives. Changes to those may delay or otherwise negatively affect the demand for our services and solutions.\nIf our manufacturers, suppliers or our service providers are unable to provide an adequate supply of products and services, our growth could be limited, and our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on third parties to supply services and materials for our integrated solutions and construction offerings as well as to manufacture our products. In order to grow our business to achieve profitability, we may need such business partners to increase, or scale up, production and supply by a significant factor over current levels. There are technical challenges to scaling up capacity that may require the investment of substantial additional funds by our manufacturers or suppliers and hiring and retaining additional management and technical personnel who have the necessary experience. If our manufacturers and suppliers are unable to do so, we may not be able to meet the requirements to grow our business to anticipated levels. We also may represent only a small portion of our supplier\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s business, and if they become capacity constrained, they may choose to allocate their available resources to other customers that represent a larger portion of their business.\nOur global operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nchallenges caused by distance, and cultural differences and by doing business with foreign agencies and governments;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles in some countries;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding liability for services and content;\n\u2022\ncredit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n\u2022\nimport and export requirements that may prevent us from shipping products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costs;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nhigher costs associated with doing business internationally;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, public health issues including impacts from global or national health epidemics and concerns such as the recent coronavirus, and other catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\ndifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers\u2019 councils and labor unions.\nIn addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international venues and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, civil and criminal penalties against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.\nOur revenues depend on key customers and suppliers.\nThe Company\u2019s major product and service lines in 2020 were electric power and solar infrastructure services, and natural gas infrastructure and in 2019 were natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions.\nDuring 2020, over 17% of revenues were derived from one customer. During 2019, over 31% of revenues were derived from two customers, one with 21% and the other with 10%.\nAt December 31, 2020, of the gross trade accounts receivable totaling approximately $9.7 million, there were three individual customers that made up approximately 42% of the Company's total trade accounts receivable: one customer with 19%, one customer with 12% and one customer with 11%. At December 31, 2019, of the gross trade accounts receivable totaling approximately $5.3 million, approximately 50% was due from three customers: one with 24%, a second with 14% and a third with 12%.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any supplier concentrations that provided over 10% of our purchases included in cost of revenues.\nThe United Kingdom operations of Orbital result in foreign revenue and accounts receivable concentrations in the United Kingdom for the year ended and at December 31, 2020 of 24% and 21%, respectively, and for the year ended and at December 31, 2019 of 57% and 49%, respectively.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to maintain all of our existing key customers in the future. Should we, for any reason, discontinue our business relationship with any one of these key customers, the impact to our revenue stream would be substantial. For additional information on our concentrations, see Note 15 - Concentrations.\nThe novel coronavirus outbreak, or other similar pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of infectious disease, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and acquisitions.\nIn January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, China to be a public health emergency, prompting precautionary government-imposed travel restrictions and temporary closures of business operations, and in March 2020, the outbreak was declared to be a pandemic. Certain of our suppliers and the manufacturers of certain of our products may be adversely impacted by the novel coronavirus outbreak. As a result, we may face delays or difficulty sourcing products and services, which could negatively affect our business and financial results. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products and services, they may cost more, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. If we temporarily close our locations for periods of time or if our partners temporarily close, demand for our products and services may be reduced, and our revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAt this time, there is significant uncertainty relating to the potential ongoing effect of the novel coronavirus on our business. Infections have become widespread, which may worsen the supply shortage or force us to restrict our operations. In addition, due to the further spread of the outbreak where we have corporate offices, we have implemented various measures including remote working solutions, reduced hours, adjusted shifts, and placed various restrictions on access to our offices, which could negatively impact productivity, particularly if we restrict access to our offices for a longer period of time. Any of these occurrences may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant outbreak of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company\u2019s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extended period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected.\nUnfavorable market conditions, market uncertainty, and/or economic downturns could reduce capital expenditures in the industries we serve.\nDemand for our products, solutions and services has been, and will likely continue to be cyclical in nature. We are vulnerable to general downturns in the U.S. economy and those of the countries in which we operate. Unfavorable market conditions, market uncertainty, and/or economic downturns could have a negative effect on demand from our customers and our customers health. During such times, our customers may not have the ability to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure due to difficulty obtaining financing when there may be limited availability of debt or equity financing. This could result in project cancellations or deferral which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nDemand for alternative energy sources and legislative and regulatory changes, the volatility of oil and gas markets, among others, are beyond our control. Such economic factors can negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur failure to properly manage projects, or project delays, could result in additional costs or claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nCertain of our engagements occur over extended time periods and involve large-scale, complex projects. Our ability to manage our client relationship and the project itself, such as the timely deployment of appropriate resources, including third-party contractors and our own personnel will impact the quality of our project performance. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected if we miscalculate the resources or time needed to complete a project with capped or fixed fees, or the resources or time needed to meet contractual milestones.\nWe perform work under a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, challenging and hard to reach terrain and difficult site conditions. Performing work under such conditions can result in project delays or cancellations, potentially causing us to incur unanticipated costs, reductions in revenue or the payment of liquidated damages. In addition, some of our contracts require that we assume the risk should actual site conditions vary from those expected. Some of our projects involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases, which may occur over extended time periods. We may encounter difficulties in engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or our vendors and subcontractors, equipment and material delivery delays, permitting delays, weather-related delays, schedule changes, delays from customer failure to timely obtain rights-of-way, delays by subcontractors in completing their portion of projects and governmental, market and political or other factors, some of which are beyond our control and could affect our ability to complete a project as originally scheduled. In some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and/or we may be required to cancel or defer a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay. We may not be able to recover any of such costs. Any such delays, cancellations, errors or other failures to meet customer expectations could result in damage claims substantially in excess of the revenue associated with a project. Delays or cancellations could also negatively affect our reputation or relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts.\nWe could also encounter project delays due to opposition, including political and social activism, and such delays could adversely affect our project margins. In addition, some of our agreements require that we share in cost overages or pay liquidated damages if we do not meet project deadlines; therefore, any failure to properly estimate or manage cost, or delays in the completion of projects, could subject us to penalties, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Further, any defects or errors, or failures to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, could result in large damage claims against us. Due to the substantial cost of, and potentially long lead-times necessary to acquire certain of the materials and equipment used in our complex projects, damage claims could substantially exceed the amount we can charge for our associated services.\nFixed price contracts include risk that estimated costs are not accurate. We recognize revenue for certain projects using the cost-to-cost method of accounting and variations to assumptions could reduce profitability.\nSome of our contracts include fixed price master service and other service arrangements in which the price of our services may be set on a per unit or aggregate basis. Our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our products, solutions and services and our ability to execute within those estimates is necessary for the success of those efforts.\nFor certain projects we recognize revenue over time utilizing the cost-to-cost method of accounting whereby the percentage of revenue to be recognized in a period is measured by the percentage of the costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated costs for the contract. This method relies upon estimates of total estimated costs. Contract revenue and cost estimates are reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis as work progresses with adjustments recognized in the fiscal period in which the changes are made.\nEstimates are based upon management\u2019s reasonable assumptions, judgment and experience. There are inherent risks in estimates, including unanticipated delays, technical complications, job conditions, and other factors including management\u2019s assessment of expected variables. Any such adjustments could negatively affect the results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nWe may fail to adequately recover on claims against project owners, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance.\nFrom time to time, we may bring claims against project owners for additional costs that exceed the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract. We may also present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers. Failure to properly document the nature of change orders or claims or other reasons that may result in unsuccessful negotiations for settlement could result in reduced profits, cost overruns or project losses.\nOur subcontractors and suppliers may fail, or be unable to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or we may be unable to maintain these relationships, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe depend on subcontractors to perform work for some of our projects. There is a risk that we could have disputes with subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they perform, customer concerns, or our failure to extend existing work orders or issue new work orders under a subcontracting arrangement. Our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor could be jeopardized if any of our subcontractors fail to perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis and/or deliver the agreed-upon supplies. In addition, the absence of qualified subcontractors with whom we have satisfactory relationships could adversely affect our ability to perform under some of our contracts, or the quality of the services we provide. Additionally, in some cases, we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. We could experience a material decrease in profitability and liquidity if we pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers that fail to or delay paying us for the related work. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe also rely on suppliers, equipment manufacturers and lessors to obtain or provide the materials and equipment we require to conduct our operations. Any substantial limitation on the availability of suppliers or equipment, including from economic, regulatory or market conditions, could negatively affect our operations. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected if we were unable to acquire sufficient materials or equipment to conduct our operations.\nWe include amounts in backlog that may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits.\nOur backlog may be subject to cancellation and unexpected adjustments, as such, it is an uncertain indicator of future operating results. OEG\u2019s backlog includes estimated amounts of revenue we expect to realize from future work on uncompleted contracts, revenue from change orders and renewal options, and master service agreements. Some of these may be cancellable on short or no advance notice. Backlog amounts are determined based on contract price, estimates of work to be completed under contracts taking into account historical trends, experience on similar projects and estimates of customer demand based upon communications with our customers. In the past, we have experienced postponements, cancellations and reduction in expected future work due to customers\u2019 changing plans, market volatility, regulatory and other factors. There can be no assurance that actual results will be consistent with the estimates included in our forecasts and as such backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings.\nWe are a relatively small energy infrastructure services business and face formidable competition.\nWe are a relatively small company with limited capitalization in comparison to many of our competitors. Because of our size and capitalization, we believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness that is essential to our continued growth and success in all of our markets. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business from other companies, many of whom have greater name recognition, more resources and broader service offerings than ours.\nWe also expect competition to intensify in the future. For example, the market for our inferential natural gas monitoring device, the GasPT, is emerging and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, increasing data requirements, frequent new product introductions and shortening product life cycles. Our future success in keeping pace with technological developments and achieving product acceptance depends upon our ability to enhance our current products and to continue to develop and introduce new product offerings and enhanced performance features and functionality on a timely basis at competitive prices. Our inability, for technological or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce or deliver compelling products in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions, technologies or customer expectations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and growth prospects. Our ability to compete successfully will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering staff and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry, including providing for the continued compatibility of our products and solutions with evolving industry standards and protocols in a competitive environment.\nThe industries we serve are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and regulatory change as well as customer consolidation. Any of these could result in decreased demand for our services, solutions and products which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe compete with other companies in most of the markets in which we operate that range from small independent firms serving local markets to larger regional, national and international firms. Some of our customers employ in-house personnel to perform some of the services we provide. Most of our customers\u2019 work is awarded through bid processes, and our project bids may not be successful which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nTechnological advances in the markets we serve could change our customers\u2019 operating models and project requirements. Governmental regulations may also change our customers\u2019 project requirements and our ability to adapt to those changing requirements could reduce the demand for our solutions, services and products.\nOur business is subject to operational risk, including from operational and physical hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and negatively affect our financial condition.\nDue to the nature of the services we provide and the conditions in which we operate, our business is subject to operational hazards. Though we invest in substantial resources to provide for safety including occupational health and safety programs and by carrying appropriate amounts of insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate all hazards, including electricity, fires, explosions, mechanical failures and weather related incidents. This could result in significant liability. The risks faced by our personnel can cause personal injuries and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages which could lead to large damage claims, suspension of operations, government enforcement actions, regulatory penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. These costs could exceed the amount we charge for the associated products, solutions and services.\nIf serious accidents or fatalities occur, or if our safety records deteriorate, we could be restricted from bidding on certain projects, obtaining new customers or contracts, and contracts could be terminated. Accidents in the course of our business could result in significant liabilities, employee turnover and/or an increase to the costs of our projects.\nWe will need to grow our organization and we may encounter difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Orbital Energy Group, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, had 278 full-time employees excluding 6 employees at our discontinued operations, in Canada. We expect to experience growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations as we follow our growth strategy. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new products, solutions and services. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize new products, solutions and services and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nOur operating results may vary over time and such fluctuations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Because revenues for any future period are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty, you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any estimates we may provide to the market, the price of our common shares would likely decline substantially. Factors that could cause our operating results and stock price to fluctuate include, among other things:\n\u2022\nvarying demand for our products, solutions and services due to the financial and operating condition of our customers, and general economic conditions;\n\u2022\ninability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet our demand;\n\u2022\nsuccess and timing of new product, solutions and services introductions by us and the performance of those generally;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors regarding products, solutions, services, promotions or other transactions;\n\u2022\ncosts related to responding to government inquiries related to regulatory compliance;\n\u2022\nour ability to control and reduce product, solutions and services costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in the manner in which we sell products, solutions and services;\n\u2022\nvolatility in foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates and/or the availability and cost of financing or other working capital to our customers.\nOur operating expenses may increase as we make further expenditures to enhance and expand our operations in order to support additional growth in our business and national stock market reporting and compliance obligations.\nIn the future, we expect our operations and marketing investments to increase to support our anticipated growth and as a result of our listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market. We have made significant investments in using professional services and expanding our operations. We may make additional investments in personnel and continue to expand our operations to support anticipated growth in our business. In addition, we may determine the need in the future to increase our direct sales force, add distributors and sales representatives to market and sell our products, solutions and services. Such changes to our existing sales model would likely result in higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our revenues. We expect such increased investments could adversely affect operating income in the short term while providing long-term benefit.\nOur business depends on a strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of customers.\nWe believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness in our various markets. Market awareness of our capabilities and products, solutions and services is essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets. We expect the brand identity that we are developing with Orbital Solar Services and Orbital Power Services and the brand identity that we have developed through GasPT and Orbital Gas Systems to significantly contribute to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing these brands is critical to expanding our base of customers. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products, solutions and services, which we may not do successfully.\nNew entrants in our markets may harm our competitive position.\nNew entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology, products, solutions and services may make it more difficult for us to sell our products, solutions and services and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which may significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAdverse conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial markets may significantly restrict our ability to generate revenues or obtain debt or equity financing.\nThe global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty and governments in many countries continue to evaluate and implement spending cuts designed to reduce budget deficits. These conditions and deficit reduction measures could reduce demand for our products and services, including through reduced government infrastructure projects, which would significantly jeopardize our ability to achieve our sales targets. These conditions could also affect our potential strategic partners, which in turn, could make it more difficult to execute a strategic collaboration. Moreover, volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers\u2019 ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products, solutions and services in a timely manner, or to maintain operations and result in a decrease in sales volume. General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international economies may also cause customers to reduce purchases. Changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective. Economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers\u2019 and subcontractors\u2019 ability to supply sufficient resources in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to fulfill sales orders. It is difficult to determine the extent of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may affect our suppliers, customers, investors and business in general. Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions could significantly harm sales, profitability and results of operations.\nSome of our operations and certain suppliers and customers are located in areas subject to natural disasters or other events that could stop us from having our products made or shipped or could result in a substantial delay in our production or development activities.\nOur headquarters is located in Houston, Texas and Eclipse Foundation Group is located in Gonzales, Louisiana. The risk of hurricanes and other natural disasters in this geographic area is significant due to the proximity to the coast and its propensity to flood. Despite precautions taken by us and our third-party providers, a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems, at our locations or at third-party providers could cause interruptions to our operations. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in our ability to deliver our solutions, services and products until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembly or testing from the affected contractor(s) to another third-party vendor. We cannot assure you that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.\nDefects in our products and solutions could harm our reputation and business.\nOur products and solutions are complex and have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Defects in our products may lead to product returns and require us to implement design changes or updates.\nAny defects or errors in our products, or the perception of such defects or errors, could result in:\n\u2022\nexpenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects;\n\u2022\nloss of existing or potential customers;\n\u2022\ndelayed or lost revenue;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to attain market acceptance;\n\u2022\ndelay in the development or release of new products or services;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity, which would harm our reputation;\n\u2022\nwarranty claims against us;\n\u2022\nan increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts and the risk of costly litigation; and\n\u2022\nharm to our results of operations.\nWe and our contract manufacturers purchase some components, subassemblies and products from a limited number of suppliers. The loss of any of these suppliers may substantially disrupt our ability to obtain orders and fulfill sales as we design and qualify new components.\nWe rely on third-party components and technology to build and operate our products and solutions and we rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain the components, subassemblies and products necessary for the manufacture of our products. Shortages in components that we use in our products and solutions are possible and our ability to predict the availability of such components is limited. If shortages occur in the future, as they have in the past, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. Unpredictable price increases of such components due to market demand may occur. While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we and our contract manufacturers currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products. If our suppliers of these components or technology were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers or were to discontinue providing such components and technology to us and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide our products would be impaired. Therefore, we may be unable to meet customer demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend on key personnel and will need to recruit new personnel as our business grows.\nAs a small company, our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team who are critical to the overall management of Orbital Energy Group, Inc. and our subsidiary companies, as well as the development of our technologies, products, solutions and service offerings, our business culture and our strategic direction. The loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies on the lives of these critical individuals.\nIf we are successful in expanding our product and customer base, we will need to add additional key personnel as our business continues to grow. If we cannot attract and retain enough qualified and skilled staff, the growth of the business may be limited. Our ability to provide services to customers and expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain staff with professional experiences that are relevant to technology development and other functions the Company performs. Competition for personnel with these skills is intense. We may not be able to recruit or retain the caliber of staff required to carry out essential functions at the pace necessary to sustain or expand our business.\nWe believe our future success will depend in part on the following:\n\u2022\nthe continued employment and performance of our senior management;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and motivate our officers and key employees; and\n\u2022\nour ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, sales and customer service personnel.\nOur insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business.\nOur business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling, storing, transporting and use of the products, solutions and services we sell. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business, and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance, we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may become subject to lawsuits, indemnity or other claims, in the ordinary course of our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of our business. These actions and proceedings may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, environmental liabilities, liquidated damages, consequential damages, punitive damages and civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. We may also be subject to litigation in the normal course of business involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our joint venture partners, equity investments, customers or other third parties.\nClaimants may seek large damage awards and defending claims can involve significant costs. When appropriate, we establish accruals for litigation and contingencies that we believe to be adequate in light of current information, legal advice and our indemnity insurance coverages. We reassess our potential liability for litigation and contingencies as additional information becomes available and adjust our accruals as necessary. We could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity if we do not properly estimate the amount of required accruals for litigation or contingencies, or if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or becomes unavailable, or if our self-insurance liabilities are higher than expected. The outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the ultimate resolution of any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management\u2019s attention from our business or divert resources away from operating our business and cause us to incur significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nExpanding and evolving data privacy laws and regulations could impact our business and expose us to increased liability.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") became effective in the European Union in May 2018, and imposed significant new requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant financial penalties for non-compliance. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) became effective in 2020. CCPA created new consumer rights relating to the access to, deletion of, and sharing of personal information that is collected by businesses. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with the more complex privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could lead to significant financial penalties, which may result in a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of U.S. and foreign earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities.\nWe are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the global scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations.\nOur overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in statutory tax rates and laws, as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities, could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us. Also, changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate.\nOur operating results may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect our operating results in U.S. dollar terms.\nA portion of our revenue arises from our international operations. Revenues generated and expenses incurred by our international operations are often denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, our consolidated U.S. dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as revenues and expenses of our international operations are translated from local currencies into U.S. dollars. In addition, our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions. The Company does not currently undertake any hedges to protect against adverse foreign currency exposure.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) formally withdrew from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), entering a transitional period which ended on December 31, 2020. Various EU laws, rules and guidance have been on-shored into domestic UK legislation and certain transitional regimes and deficiency-correction powers exist to ease the transition. The UK and the EU announced, on December 24, 2020, that they have reached agreement on a new Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the \u201cTCA\u201d) which addresses a range of aspects of the future relationship between the parties. The TCA was ratified by the UK Parliament on December 31, 2020. The TCA addresses, for example, trade in goods and the ability of UK nationals to travel to the EU on business but defers other issues. While the TCA provides clarity in some areas, elements of the uncertainty that has accompanied much of the Brexit process to date will continue. The post-Brexit border controls between the UK and EU may have adverse implications on the movement of products or sustainment activities between the UK and EU or may increase costs. The impact of the withdrawal may adversely affect business activity generally, political stability and economic conditions in the UK, the European Union and elsewhere. The economic conditions and outlook could be further adversely affected by the uncertainty concerning new or modified trading arrangements between the UK and other countries. Any of these developments could negatively affect economic growth or business activity in the UK, the European Union and elsewhere, and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We continue to closely monitor the impact to foreign currency markets, however we cannot predict the direction of Brexit-related developments or the impact of those developments on our UK operations and the economies of the markets in which we operate.\nOur gas quality inferential measurement device, GasPT, has not gained market acceptance as rapidly as we anticipated.\nOur future financial performance and ability to commercialize the GasPT device and compete successfully will depend on our ability to effectively manage acceptance and introduction of our GasPT device in the natural gas quality inferential measurement device market. Although we have entered into agreements and letters of understanding with third parties, which could result in substantial sales of the GasPT device over the next several years, there is no assurance we will sell at or near the number of units forecasted under these contracts.\nSeveral factors have and may continue to contribute to the slower than anticipated market acceptance of the GasPT device, such as: disruptive technologies, such as the GasPT device, are slow to be accepted in a mature industry, such as natural gas distribution; extensive testing and research required by large natural gas distribution customers takes an extended period of time before such potential customers place firm orders; macro-economic issues in the natural gas industry may slow or impede capital expenditures; and registration, regulatory approvals, certifications and licensing requirements in foreign countries.\nOur strategy has been to establish market acceptance and credibility with potential customers through a campaign of product exposure and disclosure of highly acceptable test results of recognized international testing laboratories along with industry seminars, conventions, trade shows, professional periodicals and public relations. While we believe that the base has been laid for substantial sales of our GasPT device over the next several years, there is no assurance that our strategy and efforts will be successful.\nA failure of our internal control over financial reporting could materially affect our business.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements due to inherent limitations in internal control systems. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to prevent and detect fraud, and could expose us to litigation, harm our reputation, and/or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our ability to compete effectively or to defend ourselves from litigation could be impaired.\nWe rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and know-how. Given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. We license our underlying intellectual property for the GasPT technology. The loss of our rights as a licensee under any of these or future technology licensing arrangements, or the exclusivity provisions of these agreements, could have a material adverse impact upon our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may occur in the future without our knowledge. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could reduce the value of our technology in licensing arrangements or in cross-licensing negotiations and could impair our ability to compete. Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering products that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our products.\nIn the future we may need to initiate infringement claims or litigation. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive and time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe have devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technology and trade secrets. In order to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our key employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets. We may have difficulty enforcing our rights to our proprietary technology and trade secrets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to determine and enforce the scope of our proprietary rights and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nIf a third party asserts that we are infringing on its intellectual property, whether successful or not, it could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and our business may be adversely affected.\nCertain industries where we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us or the parties from whom we license our technological rights in the form of lawsuits, letters or other forms of communication. These claims, whether or not successful, could:\n\u2022\ndivert management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nresult in costly and time-consuming litigation;\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to redesign our products to avoid infringement.\nAs a result, any third-party intellectual property claims against us could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business. Even if we have not infringed any third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, we cannot be sure our legal defenses will be successful and even if we are successful in defending against such claims, our legal defense could require significant financial resources and management time. Finally, if a third party successfully asserts a claim that our products infringe its proprietary rights, royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms we find acceptable or at all and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages to such third party.\nIf our contract manufacturers and subcontractors do not respect our intellectual property and trade secrets, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough we attempt to enter into agreements with our manufacturers and subcontractors to preclude them from using our intellectual property and trade secrets, we may be unsuccessful in monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights. Although we take steps to stop counterfeits, we may not be successful and customers who purchase these counterfeit goods may have a bad experience and our brand may be harmed. If such an impermissible use of our intellectual property or trade secrets were to occur, our ability to sell our products at competitive prices and to be the sole provider of our products may be adversely affected and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to an increasing number of various types of information technology vulnerabilities, threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats. Despite our efforts, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Compliance\nOur failure to comply with the regulations of federal, state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.\nOSHA establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by OSHA and various recordkeeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards and safety in excavation and demolition work, may apply to our operations. We incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of business in complying with OSHA and other state and local laws and regulations, and could incur penalties and fines in the future from violations of health and safety regulations, including, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. Our customers could cancel existing contracts and not award future business to us if we were in violation of these regulations.\nFrom time to time, we may receive notice from the Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) that our motor carrier operations will be monitored. The failure to monitor and maintain our safety performance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges. Our ability to service our customers could be damaged if we were not able to successfully resolve such issues, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur operations could affect the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances. In addition, our properties could have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products, polychlorinated biphenyls, fuel storage, air quality and the protection of endangered species. Certain of our current and historical construction operations have used hazardous materials and, to the extent that such materials are not properly stored, contained or recycled, they could become hazardous waste. Additionally, some of our contracts require that we assume the environmental risk of site conditions and require that we indemnify our customers for any damages, including environmental damages, incurred in connection with our projects. We may be subject to claims under various environmental laws and regulations, federal and state statutes and/or common law doctrines for toxic torts and other damages, as well as for natural resource damages and the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media under laws such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Such claims may arise, for example, out of current or former conditions at project sites, current or former properties owned or leased by us, or contaminated sites that have always been owned or operated by third parties. For example, we own and lease facilities at which we store our equipment. Some of these facilities may contain fuel storage tanks. If these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines. Liability may be imposed without regard to fault and may be strict and joint and several, such that we may be held responsible for more than our share of any contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share, and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties that caused the contamination. The obligations, liabilities, fines and costs or reputational harm associated with these and other events could be material and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe perform work in underground environments, which could affect the environment. A failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities or harm our reputation, and new environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business.\nSome of the work we perform is in underground environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants. In such a case, we could incur significant costs, including clean-up costs, and we may be liable for significant fines and damages and could suffer reputational harm. Additionally, we sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of terrain and water bodies, it is possible that such directional drilling could cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials or drilling fluid. These releases alone or, in combination with releases that may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law, could potentially expose us to significant clean up and remediation costs, damages, fines and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nNew environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or result in new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We may incur work stoppages to avoid violating these laws and regulations, or we may risk fines or other sanctions if we inadvertently violate these laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our business.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws, treaties and regulations and changes in existing tax laws, treaties and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and significant changes could result from the change in control of the U.S. Congress and presidency in 2021, all of which can result in significant changes to the tax rate on our earnings and have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations. Furthermore, the Biden administration has provided informal guidance on certain tax law changes that it would support, which includes, among other things, raising tax rates on both domestic and foreign income and imposing a new alternative minimum tax on book income. Since future changes to federal and state tax legislation and regulations are unknown, we cannot predict the ultimate impact such changes may have on our business.\nIn addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may be audited by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors, including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, our ability to realize deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. A significant increase in our tax rate can have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders.\nOur common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market. There can be no assurance, however, that the trading market for our common stock will be robust. A limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market for our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. During calendar year 2020, our common stock traded at a low of $0.49 and a high of $2.47.\nWe do not believe that this volatility corresponds to any recent change in our financial condition. However, such factors as: (1) our move into the renewable energy space (specifically solar); (2) the increased market interest in alternative energy stocks; (3) our recent press release outlining our commitment to bringing greater diversity and opportunities for underrepresented minority groups in the energy industry; and, (4) the changes in Washington DC with the new administration and its emphasis on renewable energy, as well as conditions in the financial markets generally, may have caused or contributed to this volatility.\nThe stock market in general, and the market for energy companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance.\nAs a result of this volatility, our securities could experience rapid and substantial decreases in price, and you may be able to sell securities you purchase under this prospectus only at a substantial loss to the initial offering price.\nSome, but not all, of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results or the quarterly or annual financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us or relevant for our business;\n\u25cf\nchanges in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nfailure of our services, products, and technologies to achieve or maintain market acceptance;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations of similar or relevant companies;\n\u25cf\nsuccess of competitive service offerings or technologies;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our capital structure, such as the issuance of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or by our competitors of significant services, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries, or both;\n\u25cf\nlitigation;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\ninvestors\u2019 general perceptions; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in general economic, industry or market conditions.\nThese factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our performance. In addition, the stock market in general and the market for energy infrastructure services companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Additionally, because the trading volume of our stock is not large, there can be a disparity between the bid and the asked price that may not be indicative of the stock\u2019s true value.\nIn addition, if the market for energy stocks, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Further, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nA possible \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand of our common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to additional price volatility.\nHistorically there has not been a large short position in our common stock. However, in the future investors may purchase shares of our common stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent an aggregate short exposure in our common stock becomes significant, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to purchase shares for delivery to share lenders at times if and when the price of our common stock increases significantly, particularly over a short period of time. Those purchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our common stock. This is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our common stock that are not directly correlated to our business prospects, financial performance or other traditional measures of value for the Company or its common stock.\nAdditional stock offerings in the future may dilute then-existing shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership of the Company.\nGiven our plans and expectations that we will need additional capital in the future, we anticipate that we may need to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable for shares of common stock, including convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock options or warrants. The issuance of additional securities in the future will dilute the percentage ownership and potentially voting power of then current stockholders and could negatively impact the price of our common stock and other securities.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future.\nPotential purchasers should not expect to receive a return on their investment in the form of dividends on our common stock. The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. Our ability to pay dividends may be further restricted by the terms of any of our future debt or preferred securities. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their own common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase shares of our stock.\nThere is a limited public trading market for our common stock so you may not be able to resell your stock and may not be able to turn your investment into cash.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the trading symbol \u2018\u2018OEG.\u2019\u2019 Our shares of common stock are thinly traded. Due to the illiquidity, the market price may not accurately reflect our relative value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. Because our common stock is thinly traded, a large block of shares traded can lead to a dramatic fluctuation in the share price and investors may not be able to liquidate their investment in us at all or at a price that reflects the value of the business.\nNasdaq may delist our common stock from its exchange which could limit your ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nIf for 30 consecutive trading days, the bid price of our common stock closes below the $1.00 per share minimum required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d), Nasdaq will send us a Notice. The Notice would not have an immediate effect on the listing of our common stock, and our common stock would continue to trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol \u201cOEG.\u201d Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), if during the 180 calendar day period following the date of the Notice (the \u201cCompliance Period\u201d), the closing bid price of our common stock would be at or above $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we would regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and our common stock would continue to be eligible for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, absent noncompliance with any other requirement for continued listing. If we did not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by the end of the Compliance Period (or the Compliance Period as may be extended) the Company\u2019s common stock would be subject to delisting. If this were to happen, we would monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nIf our common stock is delisted, our common stock would likely then trade only in the over-the-counter market. If our common stock were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; a determination that our shares are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our securities to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; a reduced amount of news and analyst coverage for our Company; and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock and would substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\nIn addition to the foregoing, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market, the application of the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. If our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market at a price of less than $5.00 per share, our common stock would be considered a penny stock. The SEC\u2019s penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that before a transaction in a penny stock occurs, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s agreement to the transaction. If applicable in the future, these rules may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares, until our common stock no longer is considered a penny stock.\nRisks Relating to Stockholder Rights\nOur board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to existing common stockholders and with the ability to adversely affect stockholder voting power and perpetuate their control.\nAlthough we do not have any preferred stock outstanding presently, our Articles of Incorporation allow us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval, as well as the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock or other preferred stockholders and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock.\nPreferred stock could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer. Accordingly, any future issuance of preferred stock or any rights to purchase preferred shares may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. This may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings attributable to and assets available for distribution to, the holders of our common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of our common stock and preferred stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation limits director liability, thereby making it difficult to bring any action against them for breach of fiduciary duty.\nOrbital Energy Group, Inc. is a Colorado corporation. As permitted by Colorado law, the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation limits the liability of directors to Orbital Energy Group, Inc. or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of a director\u2019s fiduciary duty, with certain exceptions. These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on behalf of the Company against a director.\nOur charter documents may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of the Company, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. These provisions:\n\u2022\nprovide that the authorized number of directors may be changed by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; and\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights.", "PERMNO": 13265, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "OEG"}
