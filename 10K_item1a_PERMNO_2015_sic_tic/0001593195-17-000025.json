{"cik": "1593195", "company": "tronc, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider each of the following risks, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock. The following risks relate to the Company\u2019s business, the separation from TCO, indebtedness, the securities markets and ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, the Company could be materially and adversely affected. If this occurs, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nAdvertising demand is expected to continue to be affected by changes in economic conditions and fragmentation of the media landscape.\nAdvertising revenue is our largest source of revenue. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. National and local economic conditions, particularly\nin major metropolitan markets, affect the levels of retail, national and classified newspaper advertising revenue. Changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending, auto sales, housing sales, unemployment rates, job creation, and circulation levels and rates, as well as federal, state and local election cycles, all affect demand for advertising.\nA decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities. Consolidation across various industries, such as large department store and telecommunications companies, may also reduce overall advertising revenue.\nCompetition from other media, including other metropolitan, suburban and national newspapers, websites, including news aggregation websites, social media websites and search engines, broadcasters, cable systems and networks, satellite television and radio, magazines, direct marketing and solo and shared mail programs, affects our ability to retain advertising clients and maintain or raise rates. In recent years, Internet sites devoted to recruitment, automotive and real estate have become significant competitors of our newspapers and websites for classified advertising, and retaining our historical share of classified advertising revenue remains a significant ongoing challenge.\nSeasonal variations in consumer spending cause our quarterly advertising revenue to fluctuate. Second and fourth quarter advertising revenue is typically higher than first and third quarter advertising revenue, reflecting the slower economic activity in the winter and summer and the stronger fourth quarter holiday season.\nDemand for our products is also one of many factors in determining advertising rates. For example, circulation levels for our newspapers have been declining.\nAll of these factors continue to contribute to a difficult advertising sales environment and may further adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain our advertising revenue. Our advertising revenues may decline or may decline at a faster rate than anticipated.\nIncreasing popularity of digital media and the shift in newspaper readership demographics, consumer habits and advertising expenditures from traditional print to digital media have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our operating revenues and may require significant capital investments due to changes in technology.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for delivery of news and other content and have resulted in a wide variety of consumer demands and expectations, which are also rapidly evolving. If we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nThe increasing number of digital media options available on the Internet, through social networking tools and through mobile and other devices distributing news and other content, is expanding consumer choice significantly. Faced with a multitude of media choices and a dramatic increase in accessible information, consumers may place greater value on when, where, how and at what price they consume digital content than they do on the source or reliability of such content. Further, as existing newspaper readers get older, younger generations may not develop similar readership habits. News aggregation websites and customized news feeds (often free to users) may reduce our traffic levels by driving interaction away from our websites or our digital applications. If traffic levels stagnate or decline, we may not be able to create sufficient advertiser interest in our digital businesses or to maintain or increase the advertising rates of the inventory on our digital platforms.\nIn addition, the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. Digital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are also playing a significant role in the advertising marketplace, which may cause downward pricing pressure. In addition, evolving standards for delivery of digital advertising, such as viewability, could adversely affect advertising revenues. Consequently, our digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. A decrease in our customers\u2019 advertising expenditures, reduced demand for our offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses and assets. Our inability to maintain and/or improve the performance of our customers\u2019 advertising results on our digital properties may negatively influence rates we achieve in the marketplace for our advertising inventory.\nPaywalls on our newspaper websites require users to pay for content after accessing a limited number of pages or news articles for free each month. Our ability to build a subscriber base on our digital platforms depends on market acceptance, consumer habits, pricing, terms of delivery platforms and other factors. In addition, the paywall may result in fewer page views or unique visitors to our websites if digital viewers are unwilling to pay to gain access to our digital content. Stagnation or a decline in website traffic levels may adversely affect our advertiser base and advertising rates and result in a decline in digital revenue. In order to retain and grow our digital subscription base and audience, we may have to further evolve our digital subscription model, address changing consumer requirements and develop and improve our digital products while continuing to deliver high-quality journalism and content that is interesting and relevant to our audience. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain and increase our digital subscription base and audience or that we will be able to do so without taking steps such as reducing pricing or increasing costs that would affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnological developments may also pose other challenges that could adversely affect our operating revenues and competitive position. New delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, the loss of distribution control and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers. Our advertising and circulation revenues have declined, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry, including declining newspaper buying (by young people in particular) and the migration to other available forms of media for news. We may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices, fraudulent traffic generated by \u201cbots,\u201d or malware proliferate.\nAny changes we make to our business model to address these challenges may require significant capital investments. We may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or opportunities and we may incur costs of research and development in building and maintaining the necessary and continually evolving technology infrastructure. Some of our competitors may have greater operational, financial and other resources or may otherwise be better positioned to compete for opportunities and as a result, our digital businesses may be less successful, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business operates in highly competitive markets and our ability to maintain market share and generate operating revenues depends on how effectively we compete with our competition.\nOur business operates in highly competitive markets. Our newspapers compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other newspapers as well as with other media such as the Internet, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, and yellow pages. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nOur newspaper publications generate a portion of their advertising revenue from automotive, employment, and real estate classified advertising. In recent years, websites dedicated to automotive, employment, and real estate advertising have become competitors of our newspapers and websites. As a result, even in the absence of a recession or economic downturn, technological, industry, or other changes specifically affecting these advertising sources could reduce advertising revenues and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating revenues primarily consist of advertising and paid circulation. Competition for advertising expenditures and paid circulation comes from a variety of sources, including local, regional and national newspapers, the Internet, including news aggregation websites, social media websites and search engines, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, yellow pages, outdoor billboards, and other media. Free daily newspapers are available in several metropolitan markets, and there can be no assurance that free daily publications, or other publications, will not be introduced in any markets in which we publish newspapers. Competition for newspaper advertising revenue is based largely upon advertiser results, advertising rates, readership, demographics, and circulation levels. Competition for circulation is based largely upon the content of the newspaper, its price, editorial quality, customer service, and other sources of news and information. Circulation revenue and our ability to achieve price increases for our print products may be affected by competition from other publications and other forms of media available in our various markets, declining consumer spending on discretionary items like newspapers, decreasing amounts of free time, and declining frequency of regular newspaper buying among certain demographics. We may incur higher costs competing for advertising dollars and paid circulation. If we are not able to compete effectively for advertising dollars and paid circulation, our operating revenues may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur primary strategy is to transition from a print-focused media company to a digital platform media company, and if we are not successful in our transition, our business, financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to successfully transition from a print-focused media company to a digital platform media company depends on various factors, including, among other things, the ability to:\n\u2022\nincrease digital audiences;\n\u2022\nincrease the amount of time spent on our websites, the likelihood of users returning to our websites, and their level of engagement;\n\u2022\nattract advertisers to our websites;\n\u2022\ntailor our products for mobile and tablet devices;\n\u2022\nmaintain or increase online advertising rates;\n\u2022\nexploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of competitors and develop new content, products and services; and\n\u2022\ninvest funds and resources in digital opportunities.\nThere are no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain employees with skill sets and knowledge base needed to successfully operate in digital business structure, that our sales force will be able to effectively sell advertising in the digital advertising arena versus our historical print advertising business, or that we will be able to effect the operational changes necessary to transition to from a print-focused business to a digital-focused business. We may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or opportunities, and we may incur research and development costs in building, maintaining and evolving our technology infrastructure.\nDecreases, or slow growth, in circulation may adversely affect our circulation and advertising revenues.\nOur newspapers, and the newspaper industry as a whole, are experiencing challenges to maintain or grow print circulation and circulation revenue. This results from, among other factors, increased competition from other media, particularly the Internet (which are often free to users), changing newspaper readership demographics and shifting preferences among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper. These factors could affect our ability to implement circulation price increases for our print products. Our print circulation and circulation revenue may decline or may decline at a faster rate than anticipated.\nIn addition, our circulation revenue is sensitive to discretionary spending available to subscribers in the markets we serve, as well as their perceptions of economic trends and uncertainty. Weak economic indicators in various regions across the nation may adversely impact subscriber sentiment and therefore impair our ability to maintain and grow our circulation.\nA prolonged decline in circulation could affect the rate and volume of advertising revenue. To maintain our circulation base, we may incur additional costs, and may not be able to recover these costs through circulation and advertising revenue. To address declining circulation, we may increase spending on marketing designed to retain our existing subscriber base and continue or create niche publications targeted at specific market groups. We may also increase marketing efforts to drive traffic to our proprietary websites.\nWe anticipate that readership analyses will become increasingly important now that the Alliance for Audited Media has agreed to publish readership statistics and recognize Internet use in addition to circulation information. We believe this is a positive industry development but we cannot predict its effect on advertising revenue.\nWe rely on revenue from the printing and distribution of publications for third parties that may be subject to many of the same business and industry risks that we are.\nIn 2016, we generated approximately 8.3% of our revenue from printing and distributing third-party publications, and our relationships with these third parties are generally pursuant to short-term contracts. As a result, if the macroeconomic and industry trends described herein such as the sensitivity to perceived economic weakness of discretionary spending available to advertisers and subscribers, circulation declines, shifts in consumer habits and the increasing popularity of digital media affect those third parties, we may lose, in whole or in part, a substantial source of revenue, which may adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to execute cost-control measures successfully, our total operating costs may be greater than expected, which would adversely affect our profitability.\nCommencing in 2014, we have taken steps to reduce operating costs by implementing general cost-control measures across the Company, which include offering employee buyouts and amending retirement benefits. We plan to continue our cost management efforts. If we do not achieve expected savings, are unable to implement additional cost-control measures, or our operating costs increase as a result of investments in strategic initiatives, our total operating costs would be greater than anticipated. In addition, if we do not manage our costs properly, such efforts may affect the quality of our products and our ability to generate future revenues. Reductions in staff and employee benefits and changes to our compensation structure could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nSignificant portions of our expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues. If we are not able to implement further cost-control efforts or reduce our fixed costs sufficiently in response to a decline in our revenues, this could adversely affect our results of operations.\nNewsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control.\nNewsprint and ink expense was 6.7% of our total operating expenses in 2016. The price of newsprint has historically been subject to change, and the consolidation of North American newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers. We have historically been able to realize favorable newsprint pricing by virtue of our company-wide volume and a long-term contract with a significant supplier. Failure to maintain our current consumption levels, further supplier consolidation or the inability to maintain our existing relationships with our newsprint suppliers may adversely affect newsprint prices in the future.\nWe may not be able to adapt to technological changes.\nAdvances in technologies or alternative methods of content delivery or changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies have had and could continue to have a negative effect on our business. We cannot predict the effect such technologies will have on our operations. In addition, the expenditures necessary to implement these new technologies could be substantial and other companies employing such technologies before we are able to do so could aggressively compete with our business.\nTechnological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit our ability to protect intellectual property rights.\nWe seek to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by us may not prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties. Developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. Protection of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. There can be no assurance that our efforts to enforce our rights and protect our products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for various services.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for various services. We do not control the operation of these service providers. If any of these third-party service providers terminate their relationship with us, or do not provide an adequate level of service, it would be disruptive to our business as we seek to replace the service provider or remedy the inadequate level of service. This disruption may adversely affect our operating results.\nSignificant problems with our key systems or those of our third-party service providers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe systems underlying the operations of each of our businesses are complex and diverse, and must efficiently integrate with third-party systems, such as wire feeds, video playout systems and credit card processors. Key systems\ninclude, without limitation, billing, website and database management, customer support, editorial content management, advertisement and circulation serving and management systems, information technology and communications systems, print and insert production systems, and internal financial systems. Some of these systems and/or support thereof are outsourced to third parties. We or our third-party service providers may experience problems with these systems. All information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. The continued and uninterrupted performance of our key systems is critical to our success. Unanticipated problems affecting these systems could cause interruptions in our services. In addition, if our third-party service providers face financial or other difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted. Any significant errors, damage, failures, interruptions, delays, or other problems with our systems, our backup systems or our third-party service providers or their systems could adversely impact our ability to satisfy our customers or operate our businesses, and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business, operating results and reputation may be negatively impacted and we may be subject to legal and regulatory claims if there is a loss, destruction, disclosure, misappropriation or alteration of or unauthorized access to data owned or maintained by us, or if we are the subject of a significant data breach or cyberattack.\nWe rely on our information technology and communications systems to manage our business data, including communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. Attempts to compromise information technology and communications systems occur regularly across many industries and sectors, and we may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control. Moreover, the techniques used to attempt attacks are constantly changing. As cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, and as tools and resources become more readily available to malicious third parties, there can be no guarantee that our actions, security measures and controls designed to prevent, detect or respond to intrusion, to limit access to data, to prevent destruction, alteration, or exfiltration of data, or to limit the negative impact from such attacks, can provide absolute security against compromise. As a result, our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes may be lost, destroyed, disclosed, misappropriated, altered or accessed without consent.\nA significant breach or successful attack could result in significant remediation costs, including repairing system damage, engaging third-party experts, deploying additional personnel, training employees, and compensation or incentives offered to third parties whose data has been compromised. Breaches of information security may lead to lost revenues resulting from a loss in competitive advantage due to the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, destruction or use of business data, the failure to retain or attract customers, the disruption of critical business processes or information technology systems, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. Moreover, such disruptions and breaches may result in adverse media coverage, which may harm our reputation. We may be subject to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, and related legal fees, as well as potential settlements, judgments and fines. We maintain insurance, but the coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nOur possession and use of personal information and the use of payment cards by our customers present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized access to or disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to liabilities and costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nOur online systems store and process confidential subscriber, employee and other sensitive data, such as names, email addresses, addresses, personal health information, social security numbers, and other personal information. Therefore, maintaining our network security is critical. Additionally, we depend on the security of our third-party service providers. Unauthorized use of or inappropriate access to our, or our third-party service providers\u2019 networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including payment card (credit or debit) information, of our customers. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Non-technical means, for example, actions by an employee, can also result in a data breach. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our proprietary information or the information of our customers, users or employees, cause interruption in our operations, or damage our computers or those of our customers or users. As a result of any such breaches, we may be subject to legal claims, and these events may adversely impact our reputation and interfere with our ability to provide our products and services, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. The coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nA significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all amounts charged by us. These customers provide payment card information and other personally identifiable information which, depending on the particular payment plan, may be maintained to facilitate future payment card transactions. Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the banks that issue the payment cards for their related expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give our customers the option of using payment cards. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be seriously harmed.\nThere can be no assurance that any security measures we, or our third-party service providers, take will be effective in preventing a data breach. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers or users. Failure to protect confidential customer data or to provide customers with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to liabilities imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies or courts. We could also be subject to evolving state laws that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur brands and reputation are key assets, and negative perceptions or publicity could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur brands are key assets of the Company, and our success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands. We believe that our brands are trusted by consumers and have excellent reputations for high-quality journalism and content. To the extent consumers perceive the quality of our products to be less reliable or our reputation is damaged, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business, or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, copyrights and proprietary technology. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected as a result.\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we could be party to litigation, including matters relating to alleged libel or defamation, employment-related matters, or claims that may provide for statutory damages, in addition to regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. Furthermore, the coverage, if any, and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses associated with lawsuits or investigations. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows as well as our ability to conduct our businesses as we are presently conducting them.\nIn some instances, third parties may have an obligation to indemnify us for liabilities related to litigation or governmental investigations, and may be unable to, or fail to fulfill such obligations. For example, in connection with The San Diego Union-Tribune acquisition, the seller agreed to indemnify us for certain outstanding legal matters, including the carrier litigation matter (see Note 7 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information). It is possible that the resolution of one or more such legal matters could result in significant monetary damages. The carrier litigation matter, for example, is being appealed and if adversely determined against us, could result in a final minimum damages award in excess of $12 million, which increases as interest accrues on the unpaid judgment. If the seller in The San Diego Union-Tribune acquisition were to fail to indemnify us, we would be responsible for the monetary damages, which could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow.\nWe may not achieve the acquisition component of our business strategy, or successfully complete strategic acquisitions, investments or divestitures.\nWe continuously evaluate our businesses and make strategic acquisitions, investments and divestitures as part of our strategic plan. These transactions involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration. There can be no assurance that any such acquisitions, investments or divestitures can be completed.\nAcquisitions are an important component of our business strategy; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our business through acquisitions, that any businesses acquired will perform in accordance with expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove to be correct. Future acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, an increase in interest and amortization expense and significant charges relative to integration costs. Our strategy could be impeded if we do not identify suitable acquisition candidates and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected if we overpay for acquisitions. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions may prove not to advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected returns.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including, (i) problems implementing disclosure controls and procedures for the newly acquired business; (ii) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits; (iii) unforeseen difficulties extending internal control over financial reporting and performing the required assessment at the newly acquired business; (iv) potential adverse short-term effects on operating results through increased costs or otherwise; (v) potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business; (vi) diversion of management\u2019s attention and failure to recruit new, and retain existing, key personnel of the acquired business; (vii) failure to successfully implement systems integration; (viii) exceeding the capability of our systems; (ix) the risks inherent in the systems of the acquired business and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; and (x) stockholder dilution if an acquisition is consummated (in whole or in part) through an issuance of our securities.\nOur ability to execute an acquisition strategy may also encounter limitations in completing transactions. Among other considerations, we may not be able to obtain necessary financing on attractive terms or at all, and we may face regulatory considerations that limit the identity of candidates with whom we are permitted to proceed or impose delays.\nStrategic investments are an important component of our business strategy as well. Investments in other companies expose us to the risk that we may not be able to control the operations of the companies we have invested in, which could decrease the benefits we realize from a particular relationship. The success of these investments is dependent on companies we invest in, as well as other investors. We also are exposed to the risk that a company in which we have made an investment may encounter financial difficulties, which could lead to disruption of the company\u2019s business or operations. Further, our ability to monetize the investments and/or the value we may receive upon any disposition may depend on the actions of the companies we have invested in and other investors. As a result, our ability to control the timing or process relating to a disposition may be limited, which could adversely affect the liquidity of these investments or the value we may ultimately attain upon disposition. If the value of the companies in which we invest declines, we may be required to record a charge to earnings. There can be no assurances that we will receive a return on these investments or that they will result in revenue growth or will produce equity income or capital gains in future years.\nIf we are unable to successfully operate our business in new markets we may enter, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future financial results will depend in part on our ability to profitably manage our business in new markets that we may enter. We plan to grow troncX\u2019s revenues through digital news and content verticals, including through organic growth of our existing properties and acquisitions of and investments in related businesses. We have dedicated internal resources and effort to this business strategy. Furthermore, we have expended, and may in the future expend, significant resources and effort acquiring and implementing digital news and content verticals. We believe that digital news and content verticals offer opportunities for revenue growth but there can be no assurances that this business strategy will be successful. In order to successfully execute on our growth initiatives, we will need to, among other things, anticipate and react to market conditions and develop expertise in areas outside of our business\u2019s traditional core competencies. If we are unable to manage and grow our business in new markets such as digital news and content verticals, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nContinued economic uncertainty and the impact on our business or changes to our business and operations may result in goodwill and masthead impairment charges.\nBecause we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets which we review both on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Erosion of general economic, market or business conditions could have a negative impact on our business and stock price, which may require that we record impairment charges in the future, which negatively affects our results of operations. If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets. Asset impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe assumed an underfunded pension liability as part of The San Diego Union-Tribune acquisition and our pension obligations could increase.\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune, LLC Retirement Plan is currently underfunded. As a result, our pension funding requirements could increase due to a reduction in the plan\u2019s funded status. The extent of underfunding is directly affected by a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates, changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate or expected returns, and liquidity of the plan\u2019s investments. It also is affected by the rate and age of employee retirements, along with actual experience compared to actuarial projections. These items affect pension plan assets and the calculation of pension obligations and expenses. Such changes could increase the cost to our obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results and our ability to meet those obligations. In addition, changes in the law, rules, or governmental regulations with respect to pension funding could also materially and adversely affect cash flow and our ability to meet our pension obligations.\nWe may be obligated to make greater contributions to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans that cover our union-represented employees in the next several years than previously required, placing greater liquidity needs upon our operations.\nWe contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. We are the only employer whose contributions represent more than 5% of the total contributions to each of the Chicago Newspaper Publishers Drivers\u2019 Union Pension Plan (the \u201cDrivers\u2019 Plan\u201d) and the GCIU Employer Retirement Benefit Plan (the \u201cGCIU Plan\u201d).\nThe trustees of the Drivers\u2019 Plan and the GCIU Plan implemented rehabilitation plans in 2011 and 2009, respectively, as a result of the critical status of their respective plans. The rehabilitation plans were designed to exit critical status, in the case of the Drivers\u2019 Plan, and forestall insolvency, in the case of the GCIU Plan. The Drivers\u2019 Plan and the GCIU Plan have been certified by their respective actuaries to be in critical and declining status, with projected insolvency in 2035 and 2027, respectively. As of December 25, 2016, assuming our contributions from January 1, 2017 through 2025 in the case of the Drivers\u2019 Plan, which is the expiration of its rehabilitation plan\u2019s term, and through the projected insolvency date of 2027 in the case of the GCIU Plan, it is estimated that the Company\u2019s contributions to these plans will total $69.6 million and $10.1 million, respectively, based on the actuarial assumptions utilized to develop the rehabilitation plans and assuming our staffing levels as of December 25, 2016 remain unchanged.\nThe funding obligations under the rehabilitation plans described above are subject to change based on a number of factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining with the unions, actual returns on plan assets as compared to assumed returns, actions taken by trustees who manage the plan, changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the rate used for discounting future benefit obligations, as well as changes in legislation or regulations impacting funding and payment obligations. There can be no assurances that the funding obligations under the rehabilitation plans will not increase in the future or that the rehabilitation plans will be successful in preventing or forestalling the projected insolvency of the multiemployer plans. Trustees are required to review rehabilitation plans annually and, if necessary, revise them. Given the critical and declining status of the Drivers\u2019 Plan and the GCIU Plan, and their projected insolvency in 2035 and 2027, respectively, the trustees may amend the current, or adopt new, rehabilitation plans with increased funding obligations. Trustees also may decide to terminate a multiemployer plan rather than permit it to become insolvent, and a termination would result in withdrawal liabilities for the participating employers.\nThe risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in that assets contributed are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer withdraws from or otherwise ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. Alternatively, if we stop participating in one of our multiemployer plans or one of our multiemployer plans merges with another plan, we may incur a liability based on the unfunded status of the plan.\nLabor strikes, lockouts and protracted negotiations can lead to business interruptions and increased operating costs.\nAs of December 25, 2016, union employees comprised approximately 12% of our workforce. We are required to negotiate collective bargaining agreements across our business units on an ongoing basis. Complications in labor negotiations can lead to work slowdowns or other business interruptions and greater overall employee costs. If we or our suppliers are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions or others could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect our business by disrupting our ability to provide customers with our products or services. Depending on its duration, any lockout, strike or work stoppage may have an adverse effect on our operating revenues, cash flows or operating income or the timing thereof.\nOur revenues and operating results fluctuate on a seasonal basis and may suffer if revenues during the peak season do not meet our expectations.\nOur advertising business is seasonal, and our quarterly revenues and operating results typically exhibit seasonality. Our revenues and operating results tend to be higher in the second and fourth quarters than the first and third quarters. Results for the second quarter reflect spring advertising revenues, while the fourth quarter includes advertising revenues related to the holiday season. Our operating results may suffer if advertising revenues during the second and fourth quarters do not meet expectations. Our working capital and cash flows also fluctuate as a result of this seasonality. Moreover, the operational risks described elsewhere in these risk factors may be significantly exacerbated if those risks were to occur during the fourth quarter.\nWe and members of our board of directors and certain of their affiliates have been named as defendants in a consolidated stockholder derivative lawsuit, and could be named in additional related litigation, all of which may require significant management time and attention, and result in significant legal expenses and may result in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOn June 1, 2016, Capital Structures Realty Advisors LLC, which purports to be a stockholder in the Company, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors as of June 1, 2016, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong and Nant Capital LLC (\u201cNant Capital\u201d). The complaint has named the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges in relevant part that the Board breached its fiduciary duties by \u201crefusing to negotiate with Gannett in good faith\u201d and by \u201cgoing forward with the stock sale\u201d to Dr. Soon-Shiong and Nant Capital. The complaint further alleges that Nant Capital and Dr. Soon-Shiong aided and abetted the Board\u2019s breaches of fiduciary duty. On June 6, 2016, a second derivative complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by Monroe County Employees Retirement System, which purports to be a stockholder in the Company. On June 15, 2016, a third, mirror image, derivative complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on behalf of an individual named John Solak, who purports to be a stockholder in the Company. All three cases were consolidated on June 17, 2016, under the caption In re Tribune Publishing Co. Stockholder Litigation, Consolidated C.A. No. 12401-VCS. On June 20, 2016, a fourth, mirror image derivative\ncomplaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on behalf of an individual named B.W. Tomasino, who purports to be a stockholder in the Company. That case was consolidated with the other three derivative cases on July 7, 2016. On September 2, 2016, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs seek equitable and injunctive relief, including, without limitation, rescission of the stock sale to Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong and Nant Capital, implementation of a special committee to consider Gannett and any other offer for the Company, money damages, and costs and disbursements, and such other relief deemed just and proper. The defendants deny any and all allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend vigorously against the lawsuits.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in litigation, the Company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the consolidated lawsuit or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time. Additionally, the Company maintains liability insurance for its directors and officers, which we expect to provide coverage for this litigation. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its defense of the consolidated lawsuit, and there is no assurance that the Company\u2019s insurance coverage will be sufficient or that the Company\u2019s insurance carriers will cover all claims in that litigation.\nIf we are not successful in our defense of the claims asserted in the consolidated lawsuit and those claims are not covered by insurance or exceed our insurance coverage, we may have to pay damage awards, indemnify our officers and directors from damage awards that may be entered against them and pay the costs and expenses incurred in defense of, or in any settlement of, such claims. Any such payments or settlement arrangements could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows if the claims are not covered by our insurance carriers or if damages exceed the limits of our insurance coverage. Furthermore, regardless of the outcome of these claims, defending the litigation itself could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to finance our operations.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract, integrate and retain our senior management team.\nWe have, since the beginning of 2016, restructured our senior management, including appointing a new non-executive chairman and hiring a new chief executive officer, a new chief financial officer and a new chief technology officer. Our success depends, in part, upon the services of our senior management team. If we are unable to assimilate these new senior managers, if they fail to perform effectively, if we are unable to retain them, or if we are unable to attract additional qualified senior managers as needed, our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to access the credit and capital markets at the times and in the amounts needed and on acceptable terms.\nFrom time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including: (1) our financial performance, (2) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (4) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\nIf the Distribution does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the IRC, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of TCO or tronc, then TCO may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes, and tronc may be obligated to indemnify TCO for such taxes imposed on TCO as a result thereof.\nTCO received a private letter ruling (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) to the effect that the Distribution and certain related transactions qualify as tax-free to TCO, tronc and the TCO stockholders and warrantholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, the IRS Ruling does not rule that the Distribution satisfies every requirement for a tax-free distribution, and the parties rely solely on the opinion of counsel described below for comfort that such additional requirements are satisfied.\nIn connection with the Distribution, TCO received an opinion of special tax counsel to TCO to the effect that the Distribution and certain related transactions qualify as tax-free to TCO and the stockholders and warrantholders of TCO. The opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel relied on the IRS Ruling as to matters covered by it.\nThe IRS Ruling and the opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel are based on, among other things, certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by TCO and certain of the TCO stockholders. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the IRS Ruling or the opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel. An opinion of counsel represents counsel\u2019s best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. In addition, the IRS Ruling and the opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel are based on then current law, and cannot be relied upon if the law changes with retroactive effect.\nAmong other reasons, the Distribution would be taxable to TCO pursuant to Section 355(e) of the IRC if there is a 50% or more change in ownership of either TCO or tronc, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution. Section 355(e) might apply if other acquisitions of stock of TCO before or after the Distribution, or of tronc after the Distribution, are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution. If Section 355(e) applied, TCO might recognize a very substantial amount of taxable gain.\nUnder the tax matters agreement, in certain circumstances, and subject to certain limitations, we are required to indemnify TCO against taxes on the Distribution that arise as a result of our actions or failures to act after the Distribution.\nWe may incur significant costs to address contamination issues at certain sites operated or used by our publishing businesses.\nIn connection with the Distribution, we agreed to indemnify TCO for any claims or expenses related to certain identified environmental issues. The identified issues generally relate to sites previously owned, operated or used by TCO\u2019s publishing businesses and in some cases, continue to be used for our publishing businesses at which contamination was identified. Historically, TCO\u2019s publishing business was obligated to investigate and remediate contamination at certain of these sites. TCO was also required to contribute to cleanup costs at certain of these sites that were third-party waste disposal facilities at which it disposed of its wastes. We could have additional investigation and remediation obligations and be required to contribute to cleanup costs at these facilities. Environmental liabilities, including investigation and remediation obligations, could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer laws and Delaware corporate law may permit a court to void the Distribution and related transactions, which would adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIn connection with the Distribution, TCO undertook a series of internal corporate reorganization transactions which, along with the contribution of TCO\u2019s publishing businesses, the distribution of tronc shares and the cash dividend paid to TCO, may be subject to challenge under federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws as well as under Delaware corporate law. Under applicable laws, any transaction, contribution or distribution contemplated as part of the Distribution could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if, among other things, the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return and was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the transfer.\nWe cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not any entity involved in the Distribution was insolvent at the relevant time. In general, however, a court would look at various facts and circumstances related to the entity in question, including evaluation of whether or not: (i) the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; (ii) the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or (iii) it could pay its debts as they become due.\nIf a court were to find that any transaction, contribution or distribution involved in the Distribution was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the transaction, contribution or distribution. In addition, the Distribution could also be voided if a court were to find that it is not a legal distribution or dividend under Delaware corporate law. The resulting complications, costs and expenses of either finding would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nMacroeconomic trends may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating revenues are sensitive to discretionary spending available to advertisers and subscribers in the markets we serve, as well as their perceptions of economic trends and uncertainty. Weak economic indicators, such as high unemployment rates, weakness in housing and uncertainty regarding the national and state governments\u2019 ability to resolve\nfiscal issues, may adversely impact advertiser and subscriber sentiment. These types of conditions could impair our ability to maintain and grow our advertiser and subscriber bases.\nEvents beyond our control may result in unexpected adverse operating results.\nOur results could be affected in various ways by global or domestic events beyond our control, such as wars, political unrest, acts of terrorism, natural disasters and Internet outages. Such events can quickly result in significant declines in advertising revenue and significant increases in newsgathering costs. There are no assurances that our business continuity or disaster recovery plans are adequate or that they will be implemented successfully if any such events were to occur.\nRisks Relating to our Indebtedness\nWe have significant indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and our operating activities.\nIn connection with the Distribution, on August 4, 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto (the \u201cSenior Term Facility\u201d), pursuant to which we borrowed $350 million. We used a portion of the proceeds to fund a cash dividend to TCO of $275 million immediately prior to the Distribution. In addition, in connection with the Distribution, on August 4, 2014, tronc and the Subsidiary Guarantors, in their capacities as borrowers thereunder, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer and the lenders party thereto (the \u201cSenior ABL Facility\u201d), with aggregate maximum commitments (subject to availability under a borrowing base) of approximately $140 million. Under the Senior ABL Facility, up to $75 million of commitments are available for letters of credit and up to $15 million of commitments are available for swing line loans. In addition, subject to certain conditions, without the consent of the applicable then existing lenders (but subject to the receipt of commitments), each of the Senior ABL Facility and the Senior Term Facility provided that they could be expanded by certain incremental commitments by an amount up to (i) $75 million in the case of the Senior ABL Facility and (ii) in the case of the Senior Term Facility, (A) the greater of $100 million, of which $70 million was accessed in connection with the acquisition of The San Diego Union-Tribune, and an amount as will not cause the net senior secured leverage ratio after giving effect to such incurrence to exceed 2.00 to 1.00, plus (B) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments of the term loans borrowed under the Senior Term Facility on the Distribution Date and refinancing debt in respect of such loans. Our level of debt could have important consequences to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our Board of Directors to declare dividends;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent that our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt and more favorable terms and thereby affecting our ability to compete; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness to capitalize on business opportunities which could increase the risks related to our high level of indebtedness.\nOur Senior Term Facility and Senior ABL Facility (together, the \u201cSenior Credit Facilities\u201d) allow us and our subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in certain circumstances, including the incremental commitments under such facilities, and other debt which may be secured or unsecured. We may incur such additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or investments. If we incur such additional indebtedness, our interest and amortization obligations would likely increase and the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations will depend on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We might not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. For information regarding the risks to our business that could impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, see \u201c-Risks Relating to Our Business.\u201d If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and also restrict our ability to raise debt capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their loans and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. All of these events could result in our stockholders losing some or all of the value of their investment.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions, which could harm our long-term interests.\nThe agreements governing our Senior Credit Facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These restrictions might hinder our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. A breach of the covenants under the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default may allow certain creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event the lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nAs a result of all of these restrictions, we may be: (i) limited in how we conduct our business; (ii) limited or unable to declare dividends to our stockholders in certain circumstances; (iii) unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or (iv) unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nOur indebtedness has variable rates of interest, which could subject us to interest rate risk or cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the Senior ABL Facility are at variable rates of interest and, to the extent LIBOR exceeds 1.00%, borrowings under our Senior Term Facility are at variable rates of interest, which could expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates have been at historically low levels. If interest rates increase, our future debt service obligations on the variable rate portion of our indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and\ncash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming all revolving loans are fully drawn under our Senior Credit Facilities and LIBOR exceeds 1.00%, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $0.3 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce future interest rate volatility. However, due to risks for hedging gains and losses and cash settlement costs, we may elect not to maintain such interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nRisks Related to Tribune Media Company\u2019s Emergence from Bankruptcy\nWe may not be able to favorably resolve the appeals seeking to overturn the order confirming the Plan.\nOn December 31, 2012, TCO and 110 of its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cDebtors\u201d) that had filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d) on December 8, 2008 (or on October 12, 2009, in the case of Tribune CNLBC, LLC) emerged from Chapter 11. Certain of the legal entities included in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of tronc were Debtors or, as a result of the restructuring transactions undertaken at the time of the Debtors\u2019 emergence, are successor legal entities to legal entities that were Debtors. As of December 30, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered final decrees collectively closing 106 of the Debtors\u2019 Chapter 11 cases, including each of the tronc Debtors\u2019 cases. See Note 2 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information.\nOn April 12, 2012, the Debtors, the official committee of unsecured creditors and creditors under certain TCO prepetition debt facilities filed the Fourth Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization for Tribune Company and its Subsidiaries (subsequently amended and modified, the \u201cPlan\u201d) with the Bankruptcy Court. On July 23, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order confirming the Plan (the \u201cConfirmation Order\u201d). Several notices of appeal of the Confirmation Order were filed. As of December 30, 2016, only the appeals filed by Law Debenture and Deutsche Bank remain pending. Those appeals have been fully briefed before the Delaware District Court. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 2 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information. If Law Debenture and Deutsche Bank are successful in overturning the Confirmation Order, in whole or in part, our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, the agreements relating to the Distribution, and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, collectively:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our Board of Directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for elections as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock to amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or to amend our amended and restated by-laws.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though a majority of stockholders may consider such proposal, if effected, desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of the Board of Directors. Moreover, these provisions may inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that may result from takeover attempts or speculation.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of March 6, 2017, Merrick Media, LLC (\u201cMerrick Media\u201d) and its affiliate Merrick Venture Management, LLC (\u201cMerrick Venture\u201d and together with Merrick Media, the \u201cMerrick Entities\u201d) beneficially owned approximately 24.8% of our outstanding common stock, and Nant Capital, together with Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, beneficially owned approximately 15.9% of our outstanding common stock. Michael W. Ferro, Jr., the chairman of our Board of Directors, is the sole managing member of Merrick Venture, which is the sole manager of Merrick Media. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the vice chairman of our Board of Directors, is the indirect sole owner of Nant Capital. The interests of the Merrick Entities and Nant Capital may differ from those of the Company\u2019s other stockholders. The Merrick Entities and Nant Capital are in the business of making investments in companies and maximizing the return on those investments. They currently may have, and may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain aspects of our business or that supply us with goods and services.\nSubject to certain restrictions and covenants set forth in the purchase agreements pursuant to which certain of their respective shares were acquired, the Merrick Entities and Nant Capital and their affiliates may be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval of stockholders, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. For additional information on the purchase agreements, see Note 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The directors elected by these stockholders are able to make decisions affecting our capital structure, including decisions to issue additional capital stock, implement stock repurchase programs and incur indebtedness. This influence may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest. In addition, our certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which relate to business combinations with interested stockholders, do not apply to us.\nSubstantial sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nAny sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including resales by our investors such as those to whom we have granted registration rights, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. There is no assurance that there will be sufficient buying interest to offset any such sales, and, accordingly, the price of our common stock may be depressed by those sales and have periods of volatility.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nMany factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to rise and fall, including the following: (i) declining newspaper print circulation; (ii) declining operating revenues derived from our core business; (iii) variations in quarterly results; (iv) announcements regarding dividends; (v) announcements of technological innovations by us or by competitors; (vi) introductions of new products or services or new pricing policies by us or by competitors; (vii) acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by competitors; (viii) recruitment or departure of key personnel or key groups of personnel; (ix) the gain or loss of significant advertisers or other customers; (x) changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our stock; and (xi) market conditions in the newspaper industry, the media industry, the industries of our customers, and the economy as a whole.\nWe may be subject to the actions of activist shareholders, which could adversely impact our business.\nActivist shareholders and other third parties have made, or may in the future make, strategic proposals, including unsolicited takeover proposals, suggestions or requested changes concerning the Company\u2019s operations, strategy, governance, management, business or other matters. For example, in April 2016, the Company received an unsolicited proposal from Gannett Co., Inc. to acquire all outstanding shares of the Company common stock, and eventually the Company engaged in\nsubstantive discussions and due diligence with Gannett regarding a potential transaction. On November 1, 2016, the Company was informed that Gannett decided to terminate discussions regarding a potential business combination.\nResponding to these campaigns or proposals can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees from our strategic initiatives. These activities can create perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy, or leadership and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors and customers, and cause the price of our common stock to be depressed and have periods of volatility. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any matters relating to the foregoing, and such matters may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our current initiatives, retain and attract key employees, and execute on our business strategy.\nWe have suspended the payment of cash dividends on our outstanding common stock, and our ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to limitations.\nOn February 4, 2016, we announced the suspension of our quarterly common stock cash dividend in order to preserve capital to provide us with increased financial flexibility while funding our growth strategy. Any future determination to declare and pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account our financial results, capital requirements and other factors the Board may deem relevant. In addition, because we are a holding company with no material direct operations, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to pay distributions to us in an amount sufficient for us to pay dividends. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make such distributions will be subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition and the applicable provisions of Delaware law that may limit the amount of funds available for distribution to us. Our ability to pay future cash dividends also will be subject to covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness, including under our Senior Credit Facilities, and other agreements with third parties.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the security or industry analysts downgrades our stock, ceases coverage of our company, fails to publish reports on us regularly, or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, demand for our stock may decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a stockholder in our company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.", "PERMNO": 14781, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "TPCO"}
