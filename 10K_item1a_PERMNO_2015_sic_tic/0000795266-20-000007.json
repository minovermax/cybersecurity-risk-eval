{"cik": "795266", "company": "KB HOME", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-01-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nAlthough we have operated through a number of varying economic cycles, there are several risks that could affect our ability to conduct our business, which we discuss below. If any of these risks materialize, they could, among other things, (a) materially and adversely impact our results of operations and consolidated financial statements; and (b) cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking and other statements we make in our SEC filings; in our news releases and other public reports and communications, including those we post on or make available through our websites or other electronic channels; or orally through our personnel and representatives. These risks, and other factors outside of our control, could also create or increase volatility in our common stock\u2019s market price.\nThe risk factors described below are not our only salient risks. Political events, war, terrorism, civil unrest, weather or other natural/environmental disasters, and other risks that are currently unknown or seen as immaterial, could also have a material adverse impact on our business, consolidated financial statements and/or common stock\u2019s market price.\nDemand Risks. The following could negatively affect consumer demand for our products, thereby unfavorably impacting our net orders, homes delivered, average selling prices, revenues and/or profitability:\n\u2022\nSoft or negative economic or housing market conditions. Adverse conditions in our served markets or nationally could be caused or worsened by factors outside of our control, including, for example, U.S. trade disputes with other countries or a federal government shutdown, and financial markets\u2019 reactions thereto.\n\u2022\nReduced employment levels and job and wage growth. Recent strong employment and wage growth trends may weaken or reverse in 2020. If they do, our core first-time and first move-up homebuyer segments could be particularly affected, impacting us more severely than homebuilders that target a different buyer demographic.\n\u2022\nLower population growth, household formations or other unfavorable demographic changes. These may be driven by, among other things, birth rate changes, economic factors or U.S. immigration policies.\n\u2022\nDiminished consumer confidence, whether generally or as to purchasing a home. Consumers may be reluctant to purchase a home compared to housing alternatives (such as renting apartments or homes, or remaining in their existing home) due to location or lifestyle preferences, affordability perceptions (particularly in markets experiencing rapid home price appreciation), employment instability or otherwise.\n\u2022\nTightened availability or affordability of mortgage loans and homeowner insurance coverage. Most of our buyers need a mortgage loan to purchase their home. Their ability to obtain a mortgage loan is largely subject to prevailing interest rates, lenders\u2019 credit standards and appraisals, and the availability of government-supported programs, such as those from the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Administration, Federal National Mortgage Association (also known as Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (also known as Freddie Mac). If mortgage interest\nrates increase, credit standards are tightened, appraisals for our homes are lowered, or mortgage loan programs are curtailed, potential buyers of our homes may not be able to obtain necessary mortgage financing.\nInsurance companies are increasingly drawing back from issuing, or are measurably raising premiums for, homeowner insurance policies in areas that have experienced, or are thought to be at risk of experiencing, significant wildfires, hurricanes, flooding or other natural disasters. If potential homebuyers are unable to obtain affordable homeowner insurance coverage, they may decide not to pursue purchasing a home or may cancel a home purchase contract with us.\n\u2022\nPoor lender performance. We depend on third-party lenders, including our KBHS partner Stearns, to provide mortgage loans to our homebuyers, unlike homebuilders with a wholly-owned mortgage lender. These lenders may be unable or unwilling to complete, timely or at all, the loan originations they start for our homebuyers. Poorly performing lenders can significantly delay home closings, disrupting our production schedules and delivery forecasts, or cause home purchase contract cancellations. While KBHS was not materially affected by Stearns\u2019 parent company\u2019s successfully completed bankruptcy process in 2019 (as discussed in Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this report), if KBHS performs poorly and our customers use another lender, the income from and value of our KBHS equity interest would decline.\n\u2022\nAdverse tax law changes. If federal or state laws are changed to eliminate or reduce the income tax benefits associated with homeownership, such as personal tax deductions for mortgage loan interest costs and real estate taxes, the after-tax cost of homeownership could measurably increase and diminish consumer interest in buying a home, as could increases in personal income tax rates.\n\u2022\nCompetition. We face significant competition for customers from other homebuilders, sellers of resale homes and other housing industry participants, including rental-housing operators. This competitive environment may, among other things, cause us to lower our home selling prices or offer incentives to attract or retain buyers.\n\u2022\nSeasonality. As discussed in Item 1 - Business in this report, we historically have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results with measurably more homes delivered and revenues generated in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. However, this pattern may not continue in the future at all or to the same degree as in the past.\nSupply Risks. The following could negatively affect our ability to increase our owned and controlled lot inventory, community count, operational scale and market share, and to grow our business, if at all:\n\u2022\nLack of available land. Securing sufficient developable land that meets our investment return standards is critical for us to meet our strategic goals and profitably expand our business\u2019 scale. Land availability depends on several factors, including geographical/topographical/governmental constraints, sellers\u2019 business relationships and reputation within the residential real estate community, and competition from other parties, some of which can bid more for land. We expect to continue to face fierce competition for desirable land in our served markets in 2020, pressuring its availability and increasing its cost.\n\u2022\nInsufficient financial resources. Our business needs considerable cash to, among other things, acquire and develop land, build homes and provide customer service. We expect to meet our needs with existing cash, future operational cash flow, our Credit Facility and LOC Facility, or outside sources, including project financing. However, outside financing may be unavailable, costly and/or considerably dilute stockholders. For instance:\n\u25e6\nTight capital or financial market conditions may hinder our ability to obtain external financing, or use or expand our Credit Facility and LOC Facility, on favorable terms or at all. Also, if a rating agency downgrades our credit rating or outlook, external financing may be difficult and costly for us to obtain.\n\u25e6\nNoncompliance with our Credit Facility and senior notes\u2019 covenants (see Note 14 - Notes Payable in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report) may restrict our ability to borrow; accelerate repayment of our debt, which may not be feasible for us; or cause our lenders to impose significant fees or cease lending to us.\n\u25e6\nAs described in Note 14 - Notes Payable in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, if a change of control or fundamental change occurs before our senior notes mature, we may need to offer to purchase certain of them. This may require us to refinance or restructure our debt, which we may be unable to do at all or on favorable terms.\n\u25e6\nOur high debt and debt-to-capital levels could require us to dedicate substantial cash flow to debt service; inhibit our ability to respond to business changes or adjust our debt maturity schedule; curb execution on our current strategies; and/or make us more vulnerable in a downturn than our less-leveraged competitors. Our next senior note\nmaturity is our $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00% senior notes due December 15, 2021 (\u201c7.00% Senior Notes due 2021\u201d).\n\u2022\nDecreased land inventory value. Our land inventory\u2019s value depends on market conditions, including our estimates of applicable future demand and revenue generation. If conditions deteriorate during the typically significant amount of time between our acquiring ownership/control of land and delivering homes on that land; if we cannot sell land held for sale at its estimated fair value; or if we make strategic changes, we may need to record inventory-related charges. We may also record charges if we decide to sell land at a loss or activate or sell land held for future development.\nIn addition, our business could be negatively affected if our home sales, homes delivered or backlog-to-homes delivered conversion rate falls; if often-volatile building materials prices or subcontractor rates increase, which has been the trend over the past few years; or if our community openings are delayed due to, among other things, prolonged development, our strategic adjustments, or protracted government approvals or utility service activations from staff or resource cuts or reallocations for public safety priorities (e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes or other natural disasters).\n\u2022\nTrade disputes and defective materials. The federal government has imposed new or increased import tariffs, and other countries have implemented retaliatory measures, raising the cost and reducing the supply of several home construction items. In addition, shortages or rising prices of building materials may ensue from manufacturing defects, resulting in recalls of materials. If such disputes continue or recalls occur, our costs and supply chain disruptions could increase further.\n\u2022\nPoor subcontractor availability and performance. Independent subcontractors perform essentially all of our land development and home construction work. Though we supervise such activities at our community sites, we have no control over our subcontractors\u2019 availability or work methods. If qualified subcontractors are not available (due to general shortages in a tight labor market, competition from other builders or otherwise), or do not timely perform, we may incur production delays and other inefficiencies, or higher costs for substitute services. Also, if our subcontractors\u2019 work or materials quality does not meet our standards, we could face more home warranty and construction defect claims, and they or their insurers may not be able to cover the associated repair costs.\n\u2022\nResponsibility for duties owed to subcontractors\u2019 employees. Governmental agencies have at times sought to hold contractors like us responsible for subcontractors\u2019 employment-related obligations to their workforces. For instance, under California law, regulators or others could assert that we are responsible for wages and benefits that our subcontractors fail to pay to their employees, or, in certain circumstances, it could be alleged that employees of our subcontractors should be deemed to be our employees. Further efforts to impose such external labor-related obligations on us could create substantial exposure for us in situations beyond our control.\nStrategy Risks. Our strategies, and any related initiatives or actions, and any changes thereto, may not be successful in achieving our goals or generate any growth, earnings or returns. We may not achieve positive operational or financial results, or results equal to or better than we did in any prior period or in comparison to other homebuilders. Among other strategic risks, our business is presently concentrated in California, Florida, Nevada and Texas. Poor conditions in any of those markets could have a measurable negative impact on our results, and the impact could be larger for us than for other less-concentrated homebuilders. At the same time, we may not be successful in generating positive results from our recent expansion into the Seattle, Washington market, or if we choose to enter into any other new markets, based on our relative inexperience with the local homebuilding and economic environment and the need to make a significant investment to achieve effective scale and profitable returns, which we may not be able to accomplish.\nAdverse conditions in California would have particular significance to our business. We generate the highest proportion of our revenues from and make significant inventory investments in our California operations. However, we may be constrained or delayed in entitling land and selling and delivering homes in California, and incur higher development or construction costs, from water conservation or wildfire protection measures (including precautionary and event-induced electricity blackouts, temporary or extended local or regional evacuations, development moratoriums in high-risk areas, and community resiliency design requirements) that are intended to address severe drought and climatic conditions that have arisen in recent years. In addition, as large-scale wildfires and flooding due to such conditions in California, as well as hurricanes, heavy rains and other climate change-driven natural disasters in other of our served markets, become more frequent and intense, we may experience greater disruption to our land development and homebuilding activities, delaying orders and home deliveries, among other impacts.\nAlso, California\u2019s highly regulated and litigious business environment has made the state an increasingly challenging and uncertain place for us to operate. This includes the implementing regulations under the state\u2019s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB32) intended to lower greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, we will incur higher construction costs because of a state law requirement that effectively requires that all new homes permitted to build in 2020 and beyond have solar power systems, and we may be unable to offset (through customer leases) or cover such costs through selling price increases due to competition and\nconsumer affordability concerns. In addition, California and certain of its local governments are considering or have implemented restrictions on or disincentives with respect to the creation or size of new suburban and exurban residential communities generally in favor of higher-density, urban developments that can be attractive to some buyers, but in many cases are on smaller parcels with higher building costs and more complicated entitlement requirements and may be subject to greater local opposition and/or additional site remediation work. State and local municipalities have also considered banning natural gas use in new homes, among other possible steps as part of their approaches to reduce greenhouse gases. Depending on their scope, these efforts could significantly increase our land acquisition and development costs and, along with increasing competition from other homebuilders and investors for available developable land, limit our California operations\u2019 growth, while making new homes less affordable to potential buyers in the state. Partially offsetting these trends, California\u2019s governor and certain legislators have taken positions to promote new housing construction, including the adoption of the Housing Crisis Act of 2019 (SB 330) intended to expedite the approval process for housing development in order to address the housing shortage in California.\nWarranty Risks. Our homebuilding business is subject to warranty and construction defect claims. Though we have insurance coverage to partially reduce our exposure, it is limited and costly, in part due to a shrinking provider market, and we have high self-insured retentions that are expected to increase. We self-insure some of our risk through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary.\nDue to our dependence on independent subcontractors to perform our homebuilding activities and inherent uncertainties, including obtaining recoveries from responsible subcontractors and/or their or our insurers, our recorded warranty and other liabilities may be inadequate to address future claims, which, among other things, could require us to record charges to increase such liabilities. We may also record charges to reflect our then-current claims experience, including the actual costs incurred. Home warranty and other construction defect issues may also generate negative publicity, including on social media and the Internet, that detracts from our reputation and efforts to sell homes.\nDeferred Tax Asset Recovery and Tax Position Risks. At November 30, 2019, we had deferred tax assets of $383.7 million, net of a $19.2 million valuation allowance. Realizing our deferred tax assets depends on our generating sufficient future taxable income, which may not occur. Also, our deferred tax assets\u2019 value can increase or decrease with: (a) changes in the federal corporate income tax rate; in 2018, we recorded a $112.5 million non-cash charge to our provision for income taxes primarily due to the federal corporate rate being reduced from 35% to 21% under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d); (b) our undergoing a \u201cchange of ownership\u201d under federal tax rules, which would significantly reduce and possibly eliminate their value; and (c) adjustments in statutory or taxing authority treatment of such assets. We have filed our tax returns based on certain positions we believe are appropriate, and we may owe additional taxes if taxing authorities disagree with those positions.\nHuman Capital Risks. Our directors, officers and employees are important resources. If we cannot attract, retain and develop talent at reasonable pay and benefits levels, which is becoming increasingly challenging in the current tight labor market, or, alternatively, if we need to implement personnel or compensation reductions, our performance, profitability and ability to achieve our strategic goals could be significantly impaired. In addition, in many of our served markets, we need to have personnel with certain professional licenses, including building contractor and real estate brokerage licenses. Our home selling and construction activities may be severely disrupted or delayed if we do not have sufficient licensed individuals in our workforce.\nInformation Technology and Information Security Risks. We use information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) resources to carry out important operational activities and maintain our business records. Third parties maintain many of our IT resources, including disaster recovery and business continuity services, under agreements with security and service level standards.\nOur systems have faced a variety of phishing, denial-of-service and other attacks. We have administrative, physical and technical controls and processes in place to address cybersecurity risks and help protect our IT resources, including employee training and third-party assessments. We also rely on our service providers, Stearns and other mortgage lenders with whom we share some personal identifying and confidential information to secure our information and the homebuyer information they collect from us. Our IT security costs, including cybersecurity insurance, are significant and will likely rise in tandem with the sophistication and frequency of system attacks.\nHowever, our, Stearns\u2019 and our service providers\u2019 measures may be inadequate and possibly have operational or security vulnerabilities that could go undetected for some period of time. If our IT resources are compromised by an intentional attack, natural or man-made disaster, electricity blackout, IT failure or systems misconfiguration, service provider error, mis-managed user access protocols, personnel action, or otherwise, we may be severely limited in conducting our business and achieving our strategic goals for an extended period, experience internal control failures or lose access to operational assets or funds. A substantial disruption, or security breach suffered by Stearns/KBHS or a service provider, could damage our reputation and result in the loss of customers or revenues, in sensitive personal information being publicly disclosed or misused and/or legal proceedings against us. We may incur significant expenses to resolve such issues.\nWe have invested significant resources over the past few years to develop and implement a new custom enterprise resource planning system designed to improve the efficiency of our internal operational and administrative activities. There are inherent\nrisks in undertaking this type of broad-based IT project and we have experienced complications and delays during the implementation process. We expect these will continue as we progress and expand the scope of the system in 2020 and that we will incur appreciable additional costs in doing so. In addition, the testing and use of the new system during this rollout could increase our exposure to the security risks and consequences discussed in the foregoing paragraph.\nLegal and Compliance Risks. We are subject to substantial legal and regulatory requirements as to land development (including governmental permits, taxes and fees), the homebuilding process, worksite health and safety and environmental protection (from the effects of climate change or otherwise), which can delay our operational activities, raise our costs and/or prohibit or restrict homebuilding in some areas. For example, certain of our Texas operations are subject to rules mandating enhanced flood management practices stemming from recent large hurricanes and rainstorms. These requirements often provide broad discretion to government authorities, and they could be interpreted or revised in ways unfavorable to us. The costs to comply, or associated with any noncompliance, are, or can be, significant.\nUnder environmental laws, we may be responsible for removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances even where we were not aware of their presence or for land we previously owned. The actual or potential presence of those substances on or near our properties may prevent us from performing land development or selling homes. Also, we have been, and we may in the future be, involved in federal, state and local air and water quality agency investigations or proceedings for potential noncompliance with their rules, including rules governing discharges of materials into the air and waterways; stormwater discharges from community sites; and wetlands and listed species habitat protection, and we could incur penalties and/or be restricted from developing or building at certain community locations during or as a result of such agencies\u2019 investigations or findings.\nAdditionally, we are involved in legal, arbitral or regulatory proceedings or investigations incidental to our business, the outcome or settlement of which could result in material claims, losses, monetary damage awards, penalties, or other direct or indirect payments recorded against our earnings, or injunctions, consent decrees or other voluntary or involuntary restrictions or adjustments to our business operations or practices. Any adverse results could be beyond our expectations, insurance coverages and/or accruals at particular points in time. Unfavorable outcomes, as well as unfavorable investor, analyst or news reports related to our industry, company, personnel or operations, may also generate negative publicity, including on social media and the Internet, damaging our reputation and resulting in the loss of customers or revenues.\nTo reduce the risks and expected significant costs of defending intra-corporate proceedings in multiple venues and to help ensure that such matters are considered within a well-established body of law, our By-laws provide that, subject to certain exceptions, Delaware state courts are the exclusive forum for specified internal corporate affairs actions. This may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in their favored forum. At the same time, if a court were to allow for an alternative forum, or we waive the provision\u2019s application, for a particular matter, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving an otherwise relevant action in another jurisdiction(s).\nThe European Union and state governments, notably California and Nevada, have recently enacted or enhanced data privacy regulations, and other governments are considering establishing similar or stronger protections. These regulations impose certain obligations for securing, and potentially removing, specified personal information in our systems, and for apprising individuals of the information we have collected about them. We have incurred costs in an effort to comply with these requirements, and our costs may increase significantly if new requirements are enacted and based on how individuals exercise their rights. However, any noncompliance could result in our incurring substantial penalties and reputational damage.\nKBHS\u2019 operations are heavily regulated. If Stearns, which oversees KBHS\u2019 operations, or KBHS is found to have violated regulations, or mortgage investors demand KBHS repurchase mortgage loans it has sold to them, or cover their losses, for claimed contract breaches, KBHS could face significant liabilities, which, if they exceed its reserves, could result in our recognizing losses on our KBHS equity interest.\nOur financial results may be materially affected by the adoption of new or amended financial accounting standards, including those relating to revenue recognition and lease accounting, and regulatory or outside auditor guidance or interpretations.", "PERMNO": 70092, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "KBH"}
