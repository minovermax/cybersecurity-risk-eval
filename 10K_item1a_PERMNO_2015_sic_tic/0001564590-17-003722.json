You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks related to our financial condition and capital requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception, and are expected to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company, and we have not yet generated significant revenues. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in August 2002, including net losses of $16.9 million and $14.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $148.0 million.\nWe are still in the early stages of development of our product candidates, and have no products approved for commercial sale. To date, we have financed our operations primarily from private placements of convertible preferred stock, payments under collaboration agreements, and to a lesser extent through issuances of shares of common stock.\nWe have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our preclinical development activities. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our operating losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We are expected to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years, and our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue clinical development of marzeptacog alfa (activated) (formerly CB 813d)\u037e\n\u2022\ncontinue preclinical and clinical development of CB 2679d/ISU304\u037e\n\u2022\nfurther develop the manufacturing process for our product candidates\u037e\n\u2022\nattract and retain skilled personnel\u037e\n\u2022\nseek regulatory and marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies\u037e\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval\u037e\n\u2022\nseek to identify and validate additional product candidates\u037e\n\u2022\nacquire or in-licenses other product candidates and technologies\u037e\n\u2022\nmake milestone or other payments under collaboration agreements, or any in-license agreements\u037e\n\u2022\nmaintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio\u037e\n\u2022\ncreate additional infrastructure to support operations as a public company and our product development and planned future commercialization efforts\u037e and\n\u2022\nexperience any delays or other issues with any of the above.\nIn addition, in connection with the license granted to us by Pfizer, we agreed to make contingent cash payments to Pfizer in an aggregate amount equal to up to $17.5 million, payable upon the achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, the timing of which is uncertain. Following commercialization of any of Factor VIIa products, Pfizer would also receive a single-digit royalty on net product sales on a country-by-country basis for a predefined royalty term. See \u201cItem 1 - Business-Collaborations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFurther, in connection with an initial statement of work under the Development and Manufacturing Agreement that we have entered into with CMC ICOS Biologics, Inc. (\u201cCMC\u201d), we have agreed to a total of $3.8 million in payments to CMC, subject to the completion of work relating to the manufacturing development of marzeptacog alfa (activated). See \u201cItem 1 - Business - Collaborations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which regulatory approval is obtained. We are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of the company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain research and development efforts, diversify product offerings or even continue operations. A decline in the value of the Company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will need additional capital. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate product development programs.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is expensive. We expect our research and development expenses to increase with our ongoing activities, particularly activities related to the continued clinical development of marzeptacog alfa (activated), including a clinical efficacy trial and, if Phase 1 clinical trials of CB 2679d/ISU304 are successful, an efficacy trial for that compound. We believe that our available cash will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the first quarter of 2018. However, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of marzeptacog alfa (activated), CB 2679d/ISU304, and depending on the availability of capital, may need to delay development of some of our product candidates.\nIn August 2015, we issued $37.0 million in aggregate principal amount of redeemable convertible notes to former Targacept stockholders as part of a dividend immediately prior to the completion of the merger (the \u201cPre-Closing Dividend\u201d), with an amount equal to the total principal deposited in an escrow account for the benefit of the noteholders. The notes may be redeemed for cash or repaid upon maturity, holders may also elect to convert any principal amount of the notes into shares of common stock at a price of $137.85 per share on or before February 19, 2018. As of December 31, 2016, $17.3 million in aggregate principal has been redeemed and $0.3 million had been converted to common stock. Except for this arrangement, we have no commitments or arrangements for any additional financing to fund our research and development programs. There can be no assurance regarding the amount of the notes that will be redeemed or the portion of the remaining $19.4 million in capital that will become available to us.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient revenue from our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations and/or licensing arrangements. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs.\nBecause successful development of our product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds required to complete research and development and commercialize our products under development. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials for our product candidates in hemophilia, including marzeptacog alfa (activated) and CB 2679d/ISU304\u037e\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue\u037e\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any future collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish\u037e\n\u2022\nthe outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals\u037e\n\u2022\nthe cost of obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights, including patent rights\u037e\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments\u037e\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of completing outsourced manufacturing activities\u037e\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval\u037e\n\u2022\nthe cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire, license or invest in businesses, products or technologies.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing arrangements may cause dilution to stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders.\nDebt financing, if available at all, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, product candidates or future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We may also seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding if, and when necessary. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis, we could be required to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more, or all, of our development programs or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nIn March 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which registration statement was declared effective on April 28, 2016 and allows us to offer up to $50 million of securities from time to time in one or more public offerings of our common stock. In addition, in March 2016, we entered into a Capital on Demand\u2122 Sales Agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC (\u201cJonesTrading\u201d). In accordance with the terms of\nthe sales agreement, as of December 31, 2016, we may offer and sell additional shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $5.5 million from time to time. Any additional sales in the public market of our common stock, under the agreement with JonesTrading or otherwise under the shelf registration statement, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe have no history of clinical development or commercialization of pharmaceutical products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for the company\u2019s future viability.\nWe began operations in August 2002. Our operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing the company, developing our technology and product candidates and establishing collaborations. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully conduct a clinical trial, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a product for clinical trials or at commercial scale, or arrange for a third-party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, predictions about the company\u2019s future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nRisks related to the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates\nWe are substantially dependent upon the success of marzeptacog alfa (activated) and CB 2679d/ISU304.\nThe failure of marzeptacog alfa (activated) or CB 2679d/ISU304 to commence anticipated clinical trials or achieve successful clinical trial endpoints, delays in clinical development generally, unanticipated adverse side effects or any other adverse developments or information related to marzeptacog alfa (activated) or CB 2679d/ISU304 would significantly harm our business, its prospects and the value of the company\u2019s common stock. We expect to advance marzeptacog alfa (activated) into a Phase 2 clinical efficacy trial in individuals with hemophilia A and B inhibitors and to advance CB 2679d/ISU304 into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in individuals with hemophilia B. There is no guarantee that the results of these clinical trials, if they occur, will be positive or will not generate unanticipated safety concerns. The Phase 1 clinical trial of marzeptacog alfa (activated) was a single-dose escalation trial that would not, compared to multi-dose trials, be expected to exclude the possibility of an immunological response to marzeptacog alfa (activated) in individuals who received the product candidate. After completion of the dosing portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, Pfizer observed a positive result in an assay for a potential non-neutralizing anti-drug antibody in a single individual at a time point 60 days post-dosing that was not confirmed by testing of a subsequent, follow-up blood draw. Additional confirmatory testing indicated that this was due to a false positive assay result; however, there can be no assurance that anti-marzeptacog alfa (activated) antibodies will not be observed in subsequent trials. If subsequent multi-dose trials of marzeptacog alfa (activated) or of CB 2679d/ISU304 demonstrate a treatment-related neutralizing immunological response in individuals, development of such product could be halted. Even if the next trials of marzeptacog alfa (activated) are positive, marzeptacog alfa (activated) may require substantial additional trials and other testing before approving marzeptacog alfa (activated) for marketing, and CB 2679d/ISU304 will require additional trials and other testing before receiving approval for marketing.\nMarzeptacog alfa (activated) and CB 2679d/ISU304 are not expected to be commercially available in the near term, if at all. Further, the commercial success of each product candidate will depend upon its acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and other key decision-makers as a therapeutic and cost effective alternative to currently available products. If we are unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize marzeptacog alfa (activated) and CB 2679d/ISU304, our ability to generate revenue from product sales will be significantly delayed and our business will be materially and adversely affected, and we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue as a going concern.\nEven if the FDA or other regulatory agency approves marzeptacog alfa (activated) or CB 2679d/ISU304, the approval may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and/or production of such product and may impose ongoing commitments or requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. The FDA and other agencies also may impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval. Regulatory approval from authorities in foreign countries will be needed to market marzeptacog alfa (activated) or CB 2679d/ISU304 in those countries. Approval by one regulatory\nauthority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. If we fail to obtain approvals from foreign jurisdictions, the geographic market for marzeptacog alfa (activated) or CB 2679d/ISU304 would be limited.\nWe plan to conduct clinical trials for subcutaneous dosing trials of marzeptacog alfa (activated) and CB 2679d/ISU304, which is an untested route of administration for these product candidates in humans.\nWe expect to commence a subcutaneous prophylaxis clinical trial of marzeptacog alfa (activated) in 2017 and for ISU Abxis to commence a subcutaneous clinical trial of CB 2679d/ISU304 in the second quarter of 2017. Neither product candidate has previously been studied in human clinical trials using subcutaneous dosing. There can be no assurance that either product will achieve efficacious levels of biological activity when administered subcutaneously. There can also be no assurance that the clinical trial results will be positive or that the clinical trials will not generate unanticipated safety concerns. The failure of either product to achieve successful clinical trial endpoints, delays in clinical trial commencement or in clinical development generally, unanticipated adverse side effects, adverse immunological responses, or any other adverse developments or information related to our product candidates would significantly harm our business, its prospects and the value of our common stock.\nMarzeptacog alfa (activated) and CB 2679d/ISU304 may cause the generation of antibodies, which could prevent their further development.\nBoth marzeptacog alfa (activated) and CB 2679d/ISU304 are protein molecules which may cause the generation of antibodies in individuals who receive them. The Phase 1 clinical trial of marzeptacog alfa (activated) was a single-dose intravenous escalation trial that would not, compared with multi-dose trials or higher doses administered subcutaneously, be expected to exclude the possibility of an immunological response to marzeptacog alfa (activated) in individuals who received the product candidate. One subject from the 18 \u03bcg/kg dose group developed a weak, transient and non-neutralizing anti-marzeptacog alfa (activated) antibody at a single time point of Day 60 post-dose. The positive anti-marzeptacog alfa (activated) antibody was characterized as cross-reactive with NovoSeven\u00ae and native human Factor VII. Additional review of the raw data suggests that the bioanalytical result of a weak positive anti-drug antibody immune response at Day 60 may represent a false-positive test result. There were no subjects with evidence of neutralizing antibodies against marzeptacog alfa (activated), and there were no subjects with >50% depletion of Factor VII activity relative to baseline.\nIf subsequent multi-dose trials demonstrate a treatment-related neutralizing immunological response in individuals, development of marzeptacog alfa (activated) or of CB 2679d/ISU304 could be halted.\nWe are transitioning manufacturing and clinical activities related to marzeptacog alfa (activated) from Pfizer to CMC and continuing to optimize the manufacturing process. This process will be lengthy and its outcome uncertain.\nPfizer, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Wyeth, conducted the Phase 1 clinical trial of marzeptacog alfa (activated) pursuant to a research and license agreement. Pfizer terminated this agreement effective June 1, 2015.\nIn March 2016, we engaged CMC to conduct manufacturing development and, upon successful development of the manufacturing process, manufacture the marzeptacog alfa (activated) that we intend to use in our clinical trials on a fee-for-services basis. During 2016, we also worked with Pfizer to transition manufacturing capabilities from Pfizer to CMC, and in December 2016, Pfizer granted us an exclusive license to its proprietary rights for manufacturing materials and processes that apply to Factor VIIa variants, CB 813a and marzeptacog alfa (activated). Pfizer also transferred the IND and documentation related to the development, manufacturing and testing of the Factor VIIa products to us. Manufacturing of biological therapeutics such as marzeptacog alfa (activated) is complex and scale-dependent, and we may need to further optimize the manufacturing process of marzeptacog alfa (activated) to manufacture clinical supplies for additional clinical trials. There can be no assurance that CMC will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of marzeptacog alfa (activated) to satisfy our clinical trial requirements in a timely manner, within expected budgets or at all. See \u201cItem 1 - Business - Collaborations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are very early in our development efforts and have only one product candidate that has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial. All our other product candidates are still in preclinical development. If we are unable to obtain regulatory clearance and commercialize our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe are very early in our development efforts and have only one product candidate that has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial, marzeptacog alfa (activated). All our other product candidates are still in preclinical development. We expect to advance marzeptacog alfa (activated) into a Phase 2 clinical efficacy trial in individuals with hemophilia A and B inhibitors and to advance CB 2679d/ISU304 into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in individuals with hemophilia B. However, the FDA may require additional pre-clinical testing before we are permitted to commence subcutaneous dosing trials of marzeptacog alpha (activated), and the Korea Food and Drug Administration may require additional pre-clinical testing before subcutaneous dosing trials of CB 2679d/ISU304. Moreover, engineered protease biopharmaceuticals are a relatively new class of therapeutics. There can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of individuals the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of the engineered protease products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to support marketing approval. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. The success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nsuccessful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials\u037e\n\u2022\nreceipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities\u037e\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates\u037e\n\u2022\nmaking arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishing, commercial manufacturing capabilities\u037e\n\u2022\nlaunching commercial sales of the products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others\u037e\n\u2022\nacceptance of the products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors\u037e\n\u2022\neffectively competing with other therapies\u037e\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement\u037e\n\u2022\nprotecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio\u037e and\n\u2022\nmaintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the products following approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. Results from our successful Phase 1 trials may not be confirmed in later trials, and if serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some of our product candidates.\nClinical testing is expensive, time consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any preclinical studies and clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. The clinical development of our product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure at any stage of drug development, including failure to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a suitable population of patients, the occurrence of severe or\nmedically or commercially unacceptable adverse events, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements and determination by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority that a drug product is not approvable. It is possible that even if one or more of our product candidates has a beneficial effect, that effect will not be detected during clinical evaluation as a result of one or more of a variety of factors, including the size, duration, design, measurements, conduct or analysis of our clinical trials. Conversely, as a result of the same factors, our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any. Similarly, in our clinical trials we may fail to detect toxicity of or intolerability caused by our product candidates, or mistakenly believe that our product candidates are toxic or not well tolerated when that is not in fact the case.\nIn addition, the outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials. For example, the Phase 1 clinical trial of marzeptacog alfa (activated) was a single dose trial, and adverse immunological reactions such as the development of a neutralizing anti-drug antibody would not be likely to appear until patients received multiple doses in later trials.\nMany companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier development, and we may face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether our results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we believe that the results of clinical trials for our product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of our product candidates.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Any Phase 2, Phase 3 or other clinical trials that we may conduct may not demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nIf our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon development or limit development of the product candidate to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Any such limitations could adversely affect the value of our product candidates or common stock.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe or our collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate, enroll and maintain enrolment of a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. In particular, there is a relatively small number of individuals with hemophilia, that may cause delays in enrollment of clinical trials of marzeptacog alfa (activated) in individuals with hemophilia A and B with an inhibitor or CB 2679d/ISU304 in individuals with hemophilia B. In addition, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates.\nPatient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u2022\nthe severity of the disease under investigation\u037e\n\u2022\nthe eligibility criteria for the study in question\u037e\n\u2022\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study\u037e\n\u2022\nthe efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials\u037e\n\u2022\nthe patient referral practices of physicians\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials will result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in clinical trials conducted by us may also result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of the company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nRisks related to our reliance on third parties\nWe depend on our collaborative relationship with ISU Abxis for the Phase 1 development of CB 2679d/ISU304.\nWe have a collaboration agreement with ISU Abxis for preclinical and Phase 1/2 development of an improved, next-generation Factor IX product, CB 2679d/ISU304, to enable an investigational new drug application, which requires ISU Abxis to obtain approval from South Korean regulatory authorities to conduct trials. Under this agreement, ISU Abxis is responsible for manufacturing and Phase 1/2 clinical trials of this product candidate, and we depend on ISU Abxis to complete these activities.\nOur ability to generate revenues from this arrangement will depend on the ability of ISU Abxis to successfully perform the functions assigned to it in this arrangement, and accordingly, any failure by ISU Abxis to develop this product candidate could adversely affect our cash flows. Further, this collaboration agreement may not lead to development or commercialization of this product candidate in the most efficient manner or at all, and ISU Abxis has the right to abandon research or development projects and terminate applicable agreements, including funding obligations, prior to or upon the expiration of the agreed upon terms. We are subject to a number of risks associated with our dependence on ISU Abxis:\n\u2022\nWe are not able to control any decisions by ISU Abxis regarding the amount and timing of resource expenditures for the development or commercialization of CB 2679d/ISU304, and may have limited or no ability to control such decisions with respect to other product candidates subject to collaboration agreements\u037e\n\u2022\nISU Abxis may manufacture insufficient amounts or quality of product for a clinical trial, or have difficulty transferring manufacturing of CB 2679d/ISU304 to a CMO if needed for future clinical trials, or may experience delays in either case;\n\u2022\nISU Abxis may delay clinical trials or, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial or abandon products, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of products for clinical testing\u037e\n\u2022\nISU Abxis may not perform its obligations as expected\u037e\n\u2022\nAdverse regulatory determinations or other legal action may interfere with the ability of ISU Abxis to conduct clinical trials or other development activity, such as any failure by ISU Abxis to obtain approvals from South Korean regulatory authorities to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials of CB 2679d/ISU304\u037e\n\u2022\nISU Abxis may be subject to regulatory or legal action resulting from the failure to meet healthcare industry compliance requirements in the conduct of clinical trials or the promotion and sale of products\u037e\n\u2022\nOur relationship with ISU Abxis could be adversely impacted by changes in their key management personnel and other personnel that are administering collaboration agreements\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe collaboration with ISU Abxis may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of CB 2679d/ISU304.\nWe expect to seek to establish additional collaborations, and, if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur drug development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. Accordingly, we may seek one or more additional collaborators for the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. For example, we may seek a new collaborator to develop marzeptacog alfa (activated) and might also seek collaborators for CB 2689d/ISU304 or our earlier stage programs. In addition, full development efforts on the use of our novel proteases for the treatment of DGF or dry AMD will likely involve significant cost, and we do not expect to conduct any such efforts except in collaboration with one or more partners who are willing to pay for such costs.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we can reach a definitive agreement with a collaborator will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of preclinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities and the regulatory pathway for any such approval, the potential market for the product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering the product to patients and the potential of competing products. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available for collaboration and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us. There can also be no assurance that any collaboration agreements will be on favorable terms.\nCollaborations are complex and time consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay our development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, and increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical testing and expect to continue to do so for clinical testing and commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe currently have no internal capabilities to manufacture our product candidates for clinical use or for preclinical trials following good manufacturing practices, or GMP, or good laboratory practices, or GLP. We expect to rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture, package, label and distribute clinical supplies and commercial quantities of any product candidate that we commercialize following approval for marketing by applicable regulatory authorities. We also expect to rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture our product candidates for use in our clinical trials. Reliance on such third-party contractors entails risks, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to identify and negotiate manufacturing and supply agreements with suitable manufacturers\u037e\n\u2022\nmanufacturing delays if our third-party contractors give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreements between us and them\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of agreements by our third-party contractors at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possible breach by the third-party contractors of our agreements with them\u037e\n\u2022\nthe failure of third-party contractors to comply with applicable regulatory requirements\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possible mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or placebo not being properly identified\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug supplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nWe may incur delays in product development resulting from the need to identify or qualify manufacturers for our product candidates. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe and our contract manufacturers will be subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing our products. The manufacturing facilities on which we will rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements and have limited capacity.\nAll entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical studies or commercial sale, including any contract manufacturers for our product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical studies must be manufactured in accordance with GMP. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. We or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of a BLA on a timely basis and must adhere to the FDA\u2019s good laboratory practices, or GLP, and GMP regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all our third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the\npreparation of our product candidates or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If these facilities do not pass a pre-approval plant inspection or do not have a GMP compliance status acceptable for the FDA, FDA approval of the products will not be granted.\nThe regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our third- party contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or a third-party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical study or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nIf we or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug product or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing approval. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nAdditionally, if supply from one approved manufacturer is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. An alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a BLA supplement which could result in further delay. The regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. Switching manufacturers may involve substantial costs and is likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines.\nThese factors could cause the delay of clinical studies, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our products successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to meet contractual requirements, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical studies may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe expect to rely on third parties such as contract research organizations, or CROs, medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor clinical trials. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities will reduce our control over these activities. Our reliance on these third parties, however, will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application, such as an investigational new drug application, or IND. In addition, the CROs with whom we contract may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our preclinical studies or clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical study design. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be delayed or prevented.\nRisks related to employee matters, managing growth and our business operations\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Usman, our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Levy, our Chief Financial Officer, Fletcher Payne, and our Senior Vice President of Technical Operations, Andrew Hetherington. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees. In addition, we will need to add personnel to achieve our business objectives. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, other key employees, and our inability\nto find suitable replacements, or our inability to hire new clinical development and manufacturing personnel, could result in delays in product development and harm our business.\nWe conduct operations at our facility in the San Francisco Bay Area. This region is headquarters to many other biopharmaceutical companies and many academic and research institutions. Competition for skilled personnel in our market is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at Catalyst, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in the company\u2019s stock price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of management and scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with the company on short notice. Our employees are under at-will employment arrangements, which means that any of our employees can leave employment with Catalyst at any time, with or without notice. Failure to retain, replace or recruit personnel could harm our business.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and collaborators. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, to provide accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained during clinical studies that could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our new management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives, particularly after the completion of a one-year transition period to full compliance.\nUpon the completion of the merger between Targacept and Catalyst, the employment of the teams that historically operated the business of Targacept and its financial reporting was terminated, and substantially all of our current employees, including our finance staff, were the employees of Catalyst from before the merger or are new hires. Accordingly, prior to the merger, we had never operated our current business as a public company. As a public company, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements, in order to comply with the rules and regulations imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection, or the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. Stockholder activism, the political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways that are not currently anticipated. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. In addition, these rules and regulations make it difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage. We expect that we will annually incur significant additional expenses to comply with the requirements imposed on us as a public company.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, as a public company, we are required to perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. However, our independent registered public accounting firm was not required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2016, based on the SEC\u2019s guidance for reporting over smaller reporting companies. In addition, our testing, or the subsequent testing in the future by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that may be deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and management time on compliance-related issues. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur offices are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is prone to earthquakes. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans that, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nIf we are unable to obtain, protect or enforce intellectual property rights related to our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our product candidates. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of our patents that, may result in those patents being narrowed or invalidated. The patent applications that we own may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. Certain of our patents also cover processes, for which enforcement can be difficult. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties that, may have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf the patents or patent applications we hold or have in-licensed for our programs or product candidates are invalidated or fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidates, it could threaten our ability to commercialize future products. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available\u037e however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent and other elements of our product candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nAlthough we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.\nFurther, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement or challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter partes reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates infringes patents held by such third parties, or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. For example, we are aware of a patent that has been issued in Europe (with counterparts in Australia, China, Japan, Poland, and South Korea) and includes a claim that may read on marzeptacog alfa (activated). An opposition proceeding with respect to this patent sustained this patent, and we filed an appeal on November 11, 2016. There can also be no assurance whether or not the claims of such patent would be found to read on marzeptacog alfa (activated) even if a claim survives the opposition. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to compositions of matter, materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe.\nIn addition, we have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties, and we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates unless we redesigned infringing products (which may be impossible) or obtained a license under the applicable patents (which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all), or until such patents expire.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we or our collaborators may be required to file infringement claims that can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one of our patents is not valid, is unenforceable and/or is not infringed, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, regardless of their merit, would cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, in addition to paying royalties, redesign infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties that, may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third-party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that is important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, and changes in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The U.S. PTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, were enacted March 16, 2013. However, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business.\nRisks related to regulatory approval of our product candidates and other legal compliance matters\nIf we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nWhile we have multiple drug candidates in clinical and advanced preclinical development for a range of diseases, we have not yet submitted biologics license applications, or BLAs, for our engineered human proteases to the FDA, or similar approval filings to comparable foreign authorities. Submission of a BLA requires extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information that demonstrates the product candidate\u2019s safety, purity, and potency, also known as safety and effectiveness, for each desired indication. A BLA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. One of our product candidates, marzeptacog alfa (activated), has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial. However, failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage in the clinical trial process. Accordingly, the regulatory pathway for our product candidates is still uncertain, complex, and lengthy, and ultimately approval may not be obtained.\nWe may experience delays in completing planned clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u2022\nthe availability of financial resources to commence and complete the planned trials\u037e\n\u2022\ninability to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites\u037e\n\u2022\nobtaining approval at each clinical trial site by an independent institutional review board, or IRB\u037e\n\u2022\nrecruiting suitable patients to participate in trials\u037e\n\u2022\nhaving patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up\u037e\n\u2022\nclinical trial sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial\u037e\n\u2022\nadding new clinical trial sites\u037e and\n\u2022\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of qualified materials under cGMPs and applying them on a subject by subject basis for use in clinical trials.\nWe could also experience delays in obtaining approval if physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of our product candidates in lieu of prescribing existing treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles given the serious nature of the diseases for the core indications for our product candidates. Additionally, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs for the institutions in which the trials are being conducted, the Data Monitoring Committee for the trial, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for a number of reasons, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues, or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience termination of, or delays in the completion of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, our ability to commercialize our product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. Additionally, delays in completing trials will increase costs, slow down our product development and approval process, and impair our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Many of the factors that could create or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nThe FDA may disagree with our regulatory plan and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe results of clinical trials we conduct may not support regulatory approval of our product candidates. Our product candidates could ultimately fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials\u037e\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign authorities that our product candidates are safe and effective for any of their proposed indications\u037e\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval\u037e\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to demonstrate that our product candidates\u2019 clinical and other benefits outweigh their safety risks\u037e\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials\u037e\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to support the submission of a BLA or other comparable submission in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere\u037e\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and may not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. These regulations include:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute that, prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid, and which will constrain our marketing practices and the marketing practices of our licensees, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities\u037e\n\u2022\nthe federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of \u201cdesignated health services\u201d with whom the physician or a member of the physician\u2019s immediate family has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies\u037e\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent, and which may expose entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers to potential criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and including as a result of claims presented in violation of the Federal Healthcare Anti- Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA\u037e\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services that, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information\u037e\n\u2022\nfederal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which, among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples\u037e and\n\u2022\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare\nitems or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws requiring pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and which may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws such as HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices for our product candidates.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nMore recently, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.\nAmong the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our potential product candidates are the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents\u037e\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program\u037e\n\u2022\nexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance\u037e\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices\u037e\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability\u037e\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs\u037e\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program\u037e\n\u2022\nnew requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals\u037e\n\u2022\na new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians\u037e and\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.\nWe expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we or our collaborators may receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nWe maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts that, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use of our product candidates harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our product candidates, regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. There is a risk that our product candidates may induce adverse events. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation\u037e\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants\u037e\n\u2022\ncosts due to related litigation\u037e\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business\u037e\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants\u037e\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates\u037e and\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.\nWe carry product liability insurance of $10,000,000 per occurrence and $10,000,000 aggregate limit. We believe our product liability insurance coverage is sufficient for our current clinical programs\u037e however, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If we obtain marketing approval for product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products\u037e however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nPatients with the diseases targeted by our product candidates are often already in severe and advanced stages of disease and have both known and unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening health risks. During treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may be related to our product candidates. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our products, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory\napproval process in other countries, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRisks related to commercialization of our product candidates\nEven if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, we may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, we may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. For example, current hemophilia treatments like NovoSeven\u00ae are well established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments. If our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and potential advantages compared with alternative treatments\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices\u037e\n\u2022\nthe convenience and ease of administration compared with alternative treatments\u037e\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies\u037e\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support\u037e\n\u2022\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects\u037e and\n\u2022\nany restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.\nOur product candidates are years away from regulatory approval.\nMarzeptacog alfa (activated) and CB 2679d/ISU304 are not expected to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Further, the commercial success of either product candidate will depend upon its acceptance by physicians, individuals, third-party payors and other key decision-makers as a therapeutic and cost effective alternative to products available at the time, which may include competing products currently under development by others. See \u201cWe face substantial competition that may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\u201d If we are unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize marzeptacog alfa (activated) or CB 2679d/ISU304, our ability to generate revenue from product sales will be significantly delayed and our business will be materially and adversely affected, and we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue as a going concern.\nEven if the FDA or other regulatory agency approves marzeptacog alfa (activated) or CB 2679d/ISU304, the approval may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and/or production of such product and may impose ongoing commitments or requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. The FDA and other agencies also may impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval. Regulatory approval from authorities in foreign countries will be needed to market marzeptacog alfa (activated) or CB 2679d/ISU304 in those countries. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. If we fail to obtain approvals from foreign jurisdictions, the geographic market for marzeptacog alfa (activated) or CB 2679d/ISU304 would be limited.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if they are approved.\nWe have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure for our other product candidates, which are still in preclinical or early clinical development. Except for ISU Abxis\u2019 potential rights to commercialize CB 2679d/ISU304 in South Korea, we generally expect to retain commercial rights for the company\u2019s hemophilia product candidates. We believe that it will be possible to access the United States hemophilia market through a focused, specialized sales force. However, we have not yet developed a commercial strategy for hemophilia products outside of the United States, or for any other of our product candidates. To achieve commercial success for any product for which we obtain marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales and marketing organization within the United States, and develop a strategy for sales outside of the United States.\nThere are risks involved with establishing internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. If we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and enter into additional arrangements with third parties to perform these services, then our product revenues and profitability, if any, are likely to be lower than if we were to market, sell and distribute any products that we develop ourselves.\nWe face substantial competition that may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nSpecifically, there are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for hemophilia, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Novo Nordisk, which has developed NovoSeven\u00ae, a human recombinant coagulation Factor VIIa indicated for treatment of bleeding episodes that has been approved for use in treatment of hemophilia A or B individuals with inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX and in individuals with Factor VII deficiency and Glanzmann\u2019s thrombasthenia, Baxter, which has developed BAX 817, a biosimilar of NovoSeven\u00ae that recently completed an intravenous Phase 3 clinical trial and has been filed for marketing approval, Roche, which is developing ACE910/Emicizumab, a recombinant humanized bispecific antibody that binds to activated Factor IX and Factor X and mimics the cofactor function of Factor VIII and has been granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA to potentially treat hemophilia A, Alnylam, which is developing an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting antithrombin for the treatment of hemophilia, OPKO Biologics, whose recombinant Factor VIIa product that may also be administered subcutaneously is in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial and CSL Behring is developing an albumin-linked Factor VIIa that has an extended half-life. We are also aware of many companies focused on developing gene therapies that may compete with our planned hemophilia B indication, as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression.\nOur commercial opportunity in different indications could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and market products or therapies that are more convenient to use, more effective, less expensive, and safer to use than our products. Furthermore, if competitors gain FDA approval faster than we do, we may be unable to establish a strong market presence or to gain market share. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and individual registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nEven if we commercialize any product candidates, the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives that, would harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we may obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any product candidates successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for certain medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we or our collaborators commercialize and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. Reimbursement may affect the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate that receives marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our products may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent.\nReimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for\nany approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and overall financial condition.\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly-approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than expected, our revenues may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nWe focus our research and product development on hemostasis and inflammation treatment. Our projections of both the number of people who suffer from related conditions, as well as the subset of people with these conditions who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on estimates. These estimates may prove to be incorrect and new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients in the United States, Europe and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected or may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products, or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nRisks related to our common stock\nOur common stock ownership is concentrated with our executive officers and directors, and their respective affiliates, which limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur significant stockholders, acting together, have the ability to affect matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the approval of significant transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a strategic transaction, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically been highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically been highly volatile and the volume of common shares traded has been relatively low. Additionally, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. Factors giving rise to this volatility may include:\n\u2022\nregulatory or political developments in both the United States and abroad\u037e\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and litigation matters\u037e\n\u2022\ndisclosure of new collaborations or other strategic transactions\u037e\n\u2022\npublic concern about the safety or efficacy of product candidates or technology, their components, or related technology or new technologies generally\u037e\n\u2022\npublic announcements by competitors or others regarding new products or new product candidates\u037e and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and comments by securities analysts and investors.\nFluctuations in operating results could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. Some of the factors that may cause operating results to fluctuate on a period-to-period basis include the scope, progress, duration results and costs of preclinical and clinical development programs, as well as non-clinical studies and assessments of product candidates and programs, restructuring costs, implementation or termination of collaboration, licensing, manufacturing or other material agreements with third parties, non-recurring revenue or expenses under any such agreement, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory compliance, approvals or other regulatory actions and general and industry-specific economic conditions, particularly as affects the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical or biotechnology industries in the United States. Period-to-period comparisons of our historical and future financial results may not be meaningful, and investors should not rely on them as an indication of future performance. Fluctuating losses may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. Failure to meet these expectations may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur current trading volumes are modest, and sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price to decline. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. As part of the Pre-Closing Dividend, we issued $37.0 million in aggregate principal amount of redeemable convertible notes. At the option of the note holders, those notes will be redeemable at any time on or before February 19, 2018 or convertible into shares of the Company at a conversion rate of $137.85 per share. As of December 31, 2016, the balance of these redeemable convertible notes was $19.4 million, convertible into approximately 140 thousand shares of our common stock. In addition, we have also registered all of the shares of common stock that we may issue under our outstanding stock options and employee stock incentive plans, and as of December 31, 2016, approximately 140 thousand shares of common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $127.65 per share, approximately 7 thousand additional shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under our stock option plan, and approximately 13 thousand shares of common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants at a weighted exercise price of $145.50 per share. Conversion or exercise of these securities into shares of our common stock will cause dilution to the other holders of our common stock, and all such stock may be sold in the public market after conversion or exercise, subject to restrictions under the securities laws, which may lead to a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and provisions of Delaware law may make an acquisition more difficult and could result in the entrenchment of management.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents may make a change in control or efforts to remove management more difficult. Also, under Delaware law, our board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures. The existence of the following provisions of Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders. If the board of directors exercises this power to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and vote the stock they acquire to remove management or directors.\nOur restated certificate also provides staggered terms for the members of our board of directors, and that directors may be removed by stockholders only by vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of voting shares then outstanding. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws do not permit stockholders to call special or annual meetings of stockholders, or to act by written consent without a meeting. These provisions may prevent stockholders from replacing the entire board in a single proxy contest, making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions could also delay the removal of management by the board of directors with or without cause.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a publicly-held corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of our voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and are thus allowed to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that an independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in our SEC filings. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on any of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe have in the past and may in the future fail to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nAs previously disclosed, on November 29, 2016, we received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Capital Market indicating that we were not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid requirement. We were given a period of 180 days from the notification to regain compliance, by having the closing bid price of our common stock must exceed $1.00 for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading days. In connection with our effecting a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of our common stock, we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq within the applicable time period as of February 28, 2017.\nThere is no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements in the future. If our common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, among other things, it would likely lead to a number of negative implications, including an adverse effect on the price of our common stock, reduced liquidity in our common stock, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws and greater difficulty in obtaining financing. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.", "PERMNO": 91184, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CBIO"}
