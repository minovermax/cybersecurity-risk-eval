Risk Factors\nOur business, operations and financial condition, and the textile industry in which we operate, are subject to various risks. Some of these risks are described below, but they do not constitute all of the risks that may be applicable to us, our business or our industry. New risks may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all potential risks or to assess with certainty the likely impact of all risks. The discussion below is intended as a summary only of certain material risk factors. More detailed information concerning certain of the risk factors described below is contained in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d You should consider all such risks in evaluating the Company or making any investment decision involving the Company.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe Company faces intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign yarn producers and importers of textile and apparel products. Because the Company and the supply chains in which the Company operates do not typically operate on the basis of long-term contracts with textile and apparel customers, these competitive factors could cause the Company\u2019s customers to shift rapidly to other producers.\nThe Company competes not only against domestic and foreign yarn producers, but also against importers of foreign-sourced fabric and apparel into the U.S. and other countries in which the Company does business (particularly in Brazil with respect to commodity yarn products). The primary competitive factors in the textile industry include price, quality, product styling and differentiation, flexibility of production and finishing, delivery time and customer service. The needs of certain customers and the characteristics of particular products determine the relative importance of these various factors. A large number of the Company\u2019s foreign competitors have significant competitive advantages that may include lower labor and raw materials costs, government subsidies and favorable currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar. If any of these advantages increase, or if new and/or larger competitors emerge in the future, the Company\u2019s products could become less competitive, and its sales and profits may decrease as a result. In particular, devaluation of Chinese currency against the U.S. Dollar could result in the Company\u2019s products becoming less competitive from a pricing standpoint and/or could result in the regions covered by NAFTA and CAFTA losing market share to Chinese imports, thereby adversely impacting the Company\u2019s sales and profits. Also, while these foreign competitors have traditionally focused on commodity production, they are now increasingly focused on value-added products, where the Company has been able to generate higher margins. The Company may not be able to continue to compete effectively with imported foreign-made textile and apparel products, which would materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn Brazil, Petrosuape-Companhia Petroquimica de Pernambuco (\u201cPetrosuape\u201d), a subsidiary of Petrobras Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., a public oil company controlled by the Brazilian government, has constructed a polyester manufacturing complex located in the northeast sector of the country. Petrosuape was expected to produce PTA, polyethylene terephthalate (\u201cPET\u201d) resin, POY and textured polyester, with the potential to become a significant competitor of the Company\u2019s Brazilian operations. While there have been recent negative developments involving Petrosuape and its manufacturing complex, the PTA and PET facilities are fully operational and if the facility were to reach full commercial production of textured polyester, its operations could significantly impact the synthetic textile filament market in Brazil, thereby negatively impacting the operating results of the Company.\nSignificant price volatility of the Company\u2019s raw materials and rising energy costs may result in increased production costs, which the Company may not be able to pass on to its customers, or be able to pass on without a time lag that adversely affects the Company during one or more periods.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s raw materials are derived from petroleum-based chemicals. The prices for petroleum and petroleum-related products (and energy costs) are volatile and dependent on global supply and demand dynamics, including geo-political risks. While the Company enters into raw material supply agreements from time to time, these agreements typically provide index pricing based on quoted market prices. Therefore, supply agreements provide only limited protection against price volatility. While the Company has, at times in the past, been able to increase sales prices in response to increased raw material costs, the Company has not always been able to do so. The Company has lost in the past (and expects that it may lose in the future) customers to its competitors as a result of price increases. In addition, competitors may be able to obtain raw materials at a lower cost due to market regulations that favor local producers in certain foreign locations where the Company operates, and certain other market regulations that favor the Company over other producers may be amended or repealed. Additionally, inflation can have a long-term impact by increasing the costs of materials, labor and/or energy, any of which costs may adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to maintain satisfactory margins. If the Company is not able to fully pass on such cost increases to customers in a timely manner (or if it loses a large number of customers to competitors as a result of price increases), the result could be material and adverse to its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDepending on the price volatility of the Company\u2019s petroleum-based raw materials, the price gap between virgin raw materials and recycled bottle flake could make virgin raw materials more cost-effective than recycled raw materials, which could result in an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to sell its REPREVE\u00ae brand recycled products profitably.\nThe Company depends upon limited sources for certain of its raw materials, and interruptions in supply could increase its costs of production, cause production inefficiencies or lead to a halt in production in an extreme case.\nThe Company depends on a limited number of third parties for certain raw material supplies, such as POY, Chip and recycled plastic bottles. Although alternative sources of raw materials exist, the Company may not be able to obtain adequate supplies of such materials on acceptable terms, or at all, from other sources. The Company is dependent on NAFTA, CAFTA and Berry Amendment qualified suppliers of raw materials for the production of Compliant Yarns. These suppliers are also at risk with their raw material supply chains. Any significant disruption or curtailment in the supply of any of its raw materials could cause the Company to reduce (or cease, in an extreme case) its production for an extended period, or require the Company to increase its pricing, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company has significant foreign operations, and its consolidated results of operations may be adversely affected by the risks associated with doing business in foreign locations, including the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company has operations in Brazil, China, Colombia and El Salvador, and participates in a foreign joint venture located in Israel. The Company serves customers in Canada, Mexico, Central America, South America, Asia and various countries in Europe. The Company\u2019s foreign operations are subject to certain political, tax, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by its domestic operations that can materially impact the Company\u2019s supply chains or other aspects of its foreign operations. The risks of international operations include trade barriers, duties, exchange controls, national and regional labor strikes, social and political unrest, general economic risks, compliance with a variety of foreign laws (including tax laws), the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, taxes on distributions or deemed distributions to the Company or any of its U.S. subsidiaries, maintenance of minimum capital requirements, and import and export controls. The Company\u2019s results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant adverse development with respect to any of these matters.\nThrough its foreign operations, the Company is also exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will impact period-to-period comparisons of the Company\u2019s reported results. Additionally, the Company operates in countries with foreign exchange controls. These controls may limit the Company\u2019s ability to transfer funds from its international operations and joint venture or otherwise to convert local currencies into U.S. Dollars. These limitations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to access cash from these operations.\nThe Company\u2019s future success will depend in part on its ability to protect its intellectual property rights, and the Company\u2019s inability to enforce these rights could cause it to lose sales and its competitive advantage.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part upon its ability to protect and preserve its rights in the trademarks and other intellectual property it owns or licenses, including its proprietary know-how, methods and processes, and the intellectual property related to its REPREVE\u00ae brand. The Company relies on the trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect its intellectual property rights. However, the Company may be unable to prevent third parties, employees or contractors from using its intellectual property without authorization, breaching nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements with it, or independently developing technology that is similar to the Company\u2019s property. The use of the Company\u2019s intellectual property by others without authorization may reduce any competitive advantage that the Company has developed, cause it to lose sales or otherwise harm its business.\nThe Company has investments in less than 100% owned affiliates that the Company does not control, which subjects the Company to uncertainties about the operating performance and quality of financial reporting of these affiliates.\nThe most significant of these investments is the Company\u2019s 34% minority interest in PAL, an entity that the Company does not control. While this investment is designed to advance important business interests of the Company, the Company does not have majority voting control of PAL or the ability otherwise to control PAL\u2019s policies, management or affairs. The interests of persons who control PAL may differ from the Company\u2019s, and those persons may cause PAL to take actions that are not in the Company\u2019s best interest. Among other things, the Company\u2019s inability to control PAL may adversely affect its ability to receive distributions from PAL or to fully implement its business plan. The incurrence of debt or entry into other agreements by PAL may result in restrictions or prohibitions on PAL\u2019s ability to make distributions to the Company. Even where PAL is not restricted by contract or by law from making distributions, the Company may not be able to influence the timing or amount of such distributions. In addition, if the controlling investor in PAL fails to observe its commitments, PAL may not be able to operate according to its business plan, or the Company may need to increase its level of investment commitment. If any of these events were to occur, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company also relies on accurate financial reporting from PAL for preparation of the Company\u2019s quarterly and annual financial statements. Errors in the financial information reported by PAL could be material to the Company and may require it to restate past financial statements. Any such restatements could have a material adverse effect on the Company or the market price of its common stock.\nPAL receives economic adjustment payments from the Commodity Credit Corporation under the Economic Adjustment Assistance to Users of Upland Cotton. The economic assistance received under this program must be used to acquire, construct, install, modernize, develop, convert or expand land, plant, buildings, equipment or machinery directly attributable to the purpose of manufacturing upland cotton into eligible cotton products in the U.S. Should PAL no longer meet the criteria to receive economic assistance under the program, or should the program be discontinued, PAL\u2019s business could be significantly impacted, which would adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company requires cash to service its indebtedness and fund capital expenditures and strategic initiatives, and its ability to generate sufficient cash for those purposes depends on many factors beyond its control.\nThe Company\u2019s principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under its credit facility. The Company\u2019s ability to make payments on its indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures and to fund strategic initiatives will depend on its ability to generate future cash flows from operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to the Company in amounts sufficient, to enable the Company to pay its indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Any such development would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nRisks Relating to the Textile Industry\nA decline in general economic or political conditions, and changes in consumer spending, could cause a decline in demand for textile products.\nThe Company\u2019s products are used in the production of fabric primarily for the apparel, hosiery, home furnishings, automotive upholstery, industrial and other end-use markets. Demand for furniture and durable goods is often affected significantly by economic conditions that have global or regional industry-wide consequences. Demand for a number of categories of apparel also tends to be tied to economic cycles and customer preferences that affect the textile industry in general. Demand for textile products, therefore, tends to vary with the business cycles of the U.S. and other economies, as well as changes in global trade flows, and economic and political conditions.\nHistoric trends indicate weakening performance in the Nylon sector on a global basis. If the decline is significant in any one year, the impact could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nUnfavorable changes in trade policies and violations of existing trade policies could weaken the Company\u2019s competitive position significantly and have a material adverse effect on its business.\nA number of markets within the textile industry in which the Company sells its products, particularly the apparel, hosiery and home furnishings markets, are subject to intense foreign competition. Other markets within the textile industry in which the Company sells its products may in the future become subject to more intense foreign competition. There are currently a number of trade regulations and duties in place to protect the U.S. textile industry against competition from low-priced foreign producers, such as those in China and Vietnam. Changes in such trade regulations or duties may make the price of the Company\u2019s products less attractive than the goods of its competitors or the finished products of a competitor in the supply chain, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAccording to industry experts and trade associations, there has been a significant amount of illegal transshipments of apparel products into the U.S. and into certain other countries in the NAFTA and CAFTA regions in which the Company competes. Illegal transshipment involves circumventing duties by falsely claiming that textiles and apparel are products of a particular country of origin (or include yarn of a particular country of origin) to avoid paying higher duties or to receive benefits from regional free trade agreements, such as NAFTA and CAFTA. If illegal transshipments are not monitored, and if enforcement is not effective to limit them, these shipments could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe TPP trade agreement between the U.S., Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam was signed in February 2016. The timeline for consideration by the U.S. Congress and final enactment remains unclear at this time. When, and if, the TPP is implemented, Vietnam and other major textile and apparel exporting countries will receive beneficial duty that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s revenues and profits are dependent on a relatively small number of key customers.\nOur top ten customers accounted for approximately 33% of our net sales for fiscal 2016 and approximately 32% of receivables as of June 26, 2016. A decrease in sales to, or a complete loss of business from, a key customer could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. Dependence on a small number of large customers also creates credit risk should one or more of these key customers experience a decline in business and become unable to meet their obligations to the Company.", "PERMNO": 78044, "SIC": 2200, "TIC": "UFI"}
