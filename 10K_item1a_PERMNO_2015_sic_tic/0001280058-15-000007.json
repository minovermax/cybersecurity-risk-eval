{"cik": "1280058", "company": "BLACKBAUD INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nOur business operations face a number of risks. These risks should be read and considered with other information provided in this report.\nOur failure to compete successfully could cause our revenue or market share to decline.\nOur market is fragmented, highly competitive and rapidly evolving and there are limited barriers to entry for some aspects of this market. We mainly face competition from four sources:\n\u2022\nSoftware developers offering specialized products designed to address specific needs of nonprofit, charitable giving and educational organizations, some of which are sold with subscription pricing;\n\u2022\nProviders of traditional, less automated fundraising services, such as services that support traditional direct mail or email campaigns, special events fundraising, telemarketing and personal solicitations;\n\u2022\nCustom-developed products created either internally or outsourced to custom service providers; and\n\u2022\nSoftware developers offering general products not designed to address specific needs of nonprofit, charitable giving and educational organizations.\nThe companies we compete with and other potential competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and generate greater revenue and better name recognition than we do. Companies such as Microsoft, Salesforce.com and Oracle offer some products that are designed specifically for nonprofit organizations, and also have products with a degree of functionality for nonprofit organizations that could be considered competitive. Also, if one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with one of our other competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. For example, a large diversified software enterprise, such as Microsoft, Oracle or Salesforce.com, could decide to enter the market directly, including through acquisitions. Competitive pressures can adversely impact our business by limiting the prices we can charge our customers and making the adoption and renewal of our solutions more difficult.\nOur competitors might also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with resellers and third-party consulting firms or other parties with whom we have had relationships, thereby limiting our ability to promote our products. These competitive pressures could cause our revenue and market share to decline.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is currently derived from The Raiser's Edge, Luminate Online, Blackbaud CRM and The Financial Edge, and a decline in sales or renewals of these or similar products and related services could harm our business.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of The Raiser's Edge, Luminate Online, Blackbaud CRM and The Financial Edge, and other products that help customers manage constituent relationships and related services, and we expect revenue from these products and related services to continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. For example, revenue from the sale of The Raiser's Edge and related services represented approximately 24%, 28% and 30% of our total revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Because we often sell licenses to our products on a perpetual basis and deliver new versions and enhancements to customers who purchase annual maintenance and support, our future license, services and maintenance revenue are substantially dependent on sales to new customers. On the other hand, for our subscription products, we sell our software on an annual or multiyear basis and for annualized fees substantially lower than we would charge for a perpetual license for the same product, so that we depend on customer renewals for future revenues. If renewal rates for the products are lower than expected for any reason, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we frequently sell these or similar products to new customers and then attempt to generate incremental revenue from the sale of additional products and services. If demand for The Raiser's Edge, Luminate Online, Blackbaud CRM, The Financial Edge or similar products declines significantly, our business would suffer.\nWe encounter lengthy sales cycles, which could have an adverse effect on the amount, timing and predictability of our revenue and sales.\nPotential customers, particularly our larger enterprise clients, generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and require us to expend substantial time, effort and money educating them as to the value of our software and services. Sales of our software products to these larger customers often require an extensive education and marketing effort. We could expend significant funds and management resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale. Historically, our software product sales cycle averages approximately two months for sales to existing customers and from six to nine months for sales to new customers. Our sales cycle for all of our products and services is subject to significant risks and delays over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u2022\nOur customers' budgetary constraints;\n\u2022\nThe timing of our clients' budget cycles and approval processes;\n\u2022\nThe impact of the macroeconomic environment on our customers;\n\u2022\nOur clients' willingness to replace their current methods or software solutions;\n\u2022\nOur need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our products and services; and\n\u2022\nThe timing and expiration of our clients' current license agreements or outsourcing agreements for similar services.\nIf we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds and management resources or if we experience delays as discussed above, it could have a material adverse effect on the amount, timing and predictability of our revenue and on our operating results.\nWe encounter long and complex implementation cycles, particularly for our largest customers, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and the timing and predictability of our revenue.\nThe implementation of our products and services, particularly in our large CRM engagements, frequently involves complex configuration, business process reengineering and system interfaces and can extend for a year or more. Our enterprise CRM product offerings are complex and we may experience unanticipated implementation challenges or complexities in these engagements. Further, these projects typically are heavily dependent on customer participation, communication and timely responsiveness throughout the implementation cycle. As the complexity of these engagements increases, our revenues and profitability could suffer from delays in project completion and having to perform unplanned incremental services at rates substantially below our normal hourly rates or make investments in the form of non-billable service hours or other concessions. In certain arrangements, our ability to recognize revenue may be delayed until acceptance of the implemented product by the customer. If we are unsuccessful in implementing our products or if we experience delays, it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and the timing and predictability of our revenue.\nIf our customers do not renew their annual maintenance and support agreements or subscriptions for our products or if they do not renew them on terms that are favorable to us, our business might suffer.\nMost of our maintenance agreements are for a one year term. Our subscription arrangements are typically either for a one year term or a three year term. As the end of the annual period approaches, we seek the renewal of the agreement with the customer. Historically, maintenance and subscriptions renewals have represented a significant portion of our total revenue. Because of this characteristic of our business, if our customers choose not to renew their maintenance and support agreements or subscriptions with us on beneficial terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Our customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our products and services and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels.\nWe might not generate increased business from our current customers, which could limit our revenue in the future.\nOur ability to grow revenue is highly dependent on the success of our efforts to sell additional products and services to our existing customers. Many of our customers initially make a purchase of only one or a limited number of our products or only for a single department within their organization. These customers might choose not to expand their use of or make additional purchases of our products and services. If we fail to generate additional business from our current customers, our revenue could grow at a slower rate or even decrease. In addition, as we deploy new applications and features for our existing products or introduce new products and services, our current customers could choose not to purchase these new offerings.\nThe offering of our products on a subscription basis is evolving and demand by our customers for these offerings is increasing. Our failure to manage this evolution and demand could lead to lower than expected revenues and profits.\nIn recent years, much of our revenue growth was derived from increased subscription offerings, including SaaS. This business model depends heavily on achieving economies of scale because the initial upfront investment is costly and the associated revenue is recognized on a ratable basis, such as our recently announced Raiser's Edge NXT and Financial Edge NXT products. If we fail to achieve appropriate economies of scale or if we fail to manage or anticipate the evolution and demand for the subscription software pricing models, then our business and operating results could be adversely affected. The additional investments required to meet customer demand will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term.\nDefects, delays or interruptions in our cloud-based and hosting services could diminish demand for these services and subject us to substantial liability.\nWe currently utilize data center hosting facilities to provide cloud-based and hosting services to our customers. Any damage to, or failure of, our data center systems generally could result in interruptions in service to our customers, notwithstanding any disaster recovery arrangements that may currently be in place at these facilities. Because our cloud-based and hosting service offerings are complex, and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software systems at our data centers, our services might have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using our services. This could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm to our reputation and our business. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our Internet-based services and new errors might again be detected in the future. In addition, our customers might use our Internet-based offerings in unanticipated ways that cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data.\nBecause our customers use these services for important aspects of their businesses, any defects, delays or disruptions in service or other performance problems with our services could hurt our reputation and damage our customers' businesses. If that occurs, customers could elect to cancel their service, delay or withhold payment to us, not purchase from us in the future or make claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Any of these could harm our business and our reputation.\nThe market for software and services for nonprofit, charitable giving and educational organizations might not grow and these organizations might not continue to adopt our products and services.\nMany nonprofit organizations have not traditionally used integrated and comprehensive software and services for their nonprofit-specific needs. We cannot be certain that the market for such products and services will continue to develop and grow or that nonprofit organizations will elect to adopt our products and services rather than continue to use traditional, less automated methods, attempt to develop software internally, rely upon legacy software systems, or use software solutions not specifically designed for the nonprofit market. Nonprofit organizations that have already invested substantial resources in other fundraising methods or other non-integrated software solutions might be reluctant to adopt our products and services to supplement or replace their existing systems or methods. In addition, the implementation of one or more of our core software products can involve significant time and capital commitments by our customers, which they may be unwilling or unable to make. If demand for and market acceptance of our products and services does not increase, we might not grow our business as we expect.\nIf we are unable, or customers believe we are unable, to detect and prevent unauthorized use of credit cards and safeguard confidential donor data, we could be subject to financial liability, our reputation could be harmed and customers may be reluctant to use our products and services.\nAdvances in computer capabilities, computer hacker attacks, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect sensitive transaction data. If any such compromise of our security, or the security of our customers, were to occur, it could result in misappropriation of proprietary information or interruptions in operations and have an adverse impact on our reputation or the reputation of our customers. All of our products are currently certified as Payment Application Data Security Standard compliant. Currently some of our products are not fully compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS. Under the PCI DSS, we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use, storage and security of card data to help prevent credit card fraud. Failure to comply may subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability. If we are not fully compliant and our customers believe we are unable to detect and prevent unauthorized use of credit cards or confidential donor data, our business may be harmed. Conforming our products and services to PCI DSS or other payment services related regulations is also expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, if we do not comply with PCI DSS, issuing banks may believe that the transactions of our customers are compromised and may refuse to process those transactions. Any such refusal could harm the reputation of our products and our business.\nOur operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis, especially in our payroll and payments businesses. Due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud. The systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale. If we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner, which may harm our business. In our payments processing services business, if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions, we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments.\nAs a result of the evolution of our business model to meet customer demand, nearly 70% of our revenue is now from subscriptions and services, which produces substantially lower gross margins than our traditional license and maintenance revenue. Continuation of this trend will dilute our overall gross margins.\nOver the past several years we have evolved our business model toward subscription and service based delivery and away from the traditional software model of perpetual licenses with term-based maintenance. For example, in 2014 our subscriptions and services revenue together comprised nearly 70% of our total revenue. These changes in our model have been driven by customer demand, and we believe have the long-term benefit of producing more predictable and recurring long-term revenue streams. However our subscription and services revenue generate substantially lower gross margins than our product license revenue. For example, in 2014, our subscriptions and services gross margins were 49% and 17%, respectively, whereas for the same period our license and maintenance revenue gross margins were 89% and 83%, respectively. We expect that over time the shift toward subscription and services revenue will continue. If we are unable to achieve economies of scale in our subscription business or increase efficiency in our services business, our overall margins will be adversely affected. Additionally, if our customers and prospects, desire to adopt our subscription offerings much more rapidly than we currently anticipate and we are unable to respond in a timely fashion, we could encounter significant adverse effects to our business, including substantial capital expenditures, reduction in profitability, decrease in revenue growth and/or we could become potentially less competitive, resulting in a loss of market share.\nCertain of our services are contracted under fixed fee arrangements, which we base on estimates. If our estimated number of hours to perform implementation services on a fixed fee engagement are less than our actual hours, our operating results would be adversely affected. Services revenue as a percentage of total revenue has varied significantly from quarter to quarter due to fluctuations in licensing revenue, economic changes, varying accounting treatments, changes in the average selling prices for our products and services, our customers' acceptance of our products and our sales force execution. In addition, the volume and profitability of services can depend in large part upon:\n\u2022\nCompetitive pricing pressure on the rates that we can charge for our services;\n\u2022\nThe complexity of the customers' information technology environment and the existence of multiple non-integrated legacy databases;\n\u2022\nThe resources directed by customers to their implementation projects;\n\u2022\nThe extent of software customization included in the implementation projects; and\n\u2022\nThe extent to which outside consulting organizations provide services directly to customers.\nA decrease in the demand for services could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.\nIf we fail to respond to technological changes and successfully introduce new and improved products, our competitive position may be harmed and our business may suffer.\nThe software industry is characterized by technological change, evolving industry standards in hardware and software technology, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products encompassing new technologies, such as our recently announced Raiser's Edge NXT and Financial Edge NXT products, can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance. There is no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. Further, there can be no assurance that the products, capabilities or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We have made and continue to make significant investments to develop new technologies, and these investments may not bear fruit. Occasionally, we have been required to write down investments in product development after determining that we would no longer pursue the related product opportunity in accordance with evolving industry and customer requirements. If we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and cost-effective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nBecause competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, we might not be able to attract and retain key personnel and personnel we need to support our planned growth.\nTo meet our objectives successfully, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel with specialized skill sets. If we are unable to attract suitably qualified management, there could be a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, to execute our continuing growth plans, we need to increase the size and maintain the quality of our sales force, software development staff and our professional services organization. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, and we might not be successful in attracting and retaining them. The pool of qualified personnel with experience working with or selling to nonprofit, charitable giving and educational organizations is limited overall and specifically in Charleston, South Carolina, where our principal office is located. Our ability to maintain and expand our sales, product development and professional services teams will depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain top quality people with advanced skills who understand sales to, and the specific needs of, nonprofit, charitable giving and educational organizations. For these reasons, we have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications for our business. In addition, it takes time for our new sales and services personnel to become productive, particularly with respect to obtaining and supporting major customer accounts. We might also engage additional third-party consultants as contractors, which could have a negative impact on our earnings. If we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel, or if newly hired personnel fail to develop the necessary skills or reach productivity slower than anticipated, it would be more difficult for us to sell our products and services, we could experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings and not achieve our planned growth.\nFurther, in the past, we have used equity incentive programs as part of our overall employee compensation arrangements to both attract and retain personnel. A decline in our stock price could negatively impact the value of these equity incentive and related compensation programs as retention and recruiting tools. We may need to create new or additional equity incentive programs and/or compensation packages to remain competitive, which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders and/or adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we do not successfully address the risks inherent in the expansion of our international operations, our business could suffer.\nWe currently have non-U.S. operations in Canada, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, and we intend to expand further into international markets. We have limited experience in international operations and might not be able to compete effectively in international markets. Our international offices generated revenues of approximately $72.7 million, $63.9 million and $61.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Accordingly, international revenue increased 13.8% and 4.8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Expansion of our international operations will require a significant amount of attention from our management and substantial financial resources and might require us to add qualified management in these markets. Our direct sales model requires us to attract, retain and manage qualified sales personnel capable of selling into markets outside the United States. In some cases, our costs of sales might increase if our customers require us to sell through local distributors.\nIf we are unable to grow our international operations in a cost effective and timely manner, our business and operating results could be harmed. Doing business internationally involves additional risks that could harm our operating results, including:\n\u2022\nDifficulties associated with and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nDiffering technology standards;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\nPolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nImposition of currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nReduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u2022\nDependence on local vendors;\n\u2022\nProtectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition;\n\u2022\nCompliance with multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nSeasonal reductions in business activity specific to certain markets;\n\u2022\nLonger sales cycles;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on repatriation of earnings or new taxation thereon;\n\u2022\nDiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\nDiffering accounting rules and practices;\n\u2022\nRestrictive and varying privacy regulations in different countries, particularly in the European Union;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on the export of technologies such as data security and encryption;\n\u2022\nCompliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials; and\n\u2022\nImport and export restrictions and tariffs.\nWe expect that an increasing portion of our international revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If we expand our international operations, exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase.\nMaterial defects or errors in the software we use to deliver our services could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our services.\nThe software applications underlying our services are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our software, and new errors in our existing software may be detected in the future. Any defects that cause interruptions to the availability of our services could result in adverse impacts to our business, including:\n\u2022\nA reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our services;\n\u2022\nSales credits or refunds to our customers;\n\u2022\nLoss of existing customers and difficulty in attracting new customers;\n\u2022\nDiversion of development resources;\n\u2022\nHarm to our reputation; and\n\u2022\nIncreased warranty and insurance costs.\nAfter the release of our software, defects or errors may also be identified from time to time by our internal team and by our customers. The costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our software may be substantial and could harm our operating results. Furthermore, our customers may use our software together with products from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our software does not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts, impact our reputation and cause significant customer relations problems.\nOur failure to obtain licenses for third-party technologies could harm our business.\nWe expect to continue licensing technologies from third parties, including applications used in our research and development activities, technologies which are integrated into our products and products that we resell. We believe that the loss of any third-party technologies currently integrated into our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our inability in the future to obtain any third-party licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could delay future product development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed and integrated. This inability in turn would harm our business and operating results. Our use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our products, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nFuture acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and strain our resources.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made acquisitions in the past, and, we might acquire additional companies, services and technologies that we feel could complement or expand our business, augment our market coverage, enhance our technical capabilities, provide us with important customer contacts or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The successful integration of acquired companies will require, among other things, coordination of various departments, including product development, engineering, sales and marketing and finance, as well as integration in our system of internal controls. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nDifficulties or delays in integrating operations, technologies, services, accounting and personnel;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in supporting and transitioning customers of our acquired companies;\n\u2022\nDiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nRisks of entering new sectors of the nonprofit, charitable giving and educational industries;\n\u2022\nPotential loss of key employees; and\n\u2022\nInability to generate sufficient return on investment.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate the operations and personnel of our recently acquired companies, or if there is any significant delay in achieving integration, we will not realize the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits we expected and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions also frequently result in recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our operating results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted which, in turn, could affect the market price of our stock. Moreover, we could finance any acquisition with debt, resulting in higher leverage and interest costs. As a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisition and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. Furthermore, if we incur additional debt to fund acquisitions and are unable to service our debt obligation we may have a greater risk of default under our credit facility.\nIf we are unable to retain key personnel of our acquisitions, our business may suffer.\nThe success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to retain their engineering, sales, marketing, development and other personnel. It is possible that these employees might decide to terminate their employment. If key employees terminate their employment, the sales, marketing or development activities of acquired companies might be adversely affected, our management's attention might be diverted from successfully integrating the acquired operations and to hiring suitable replacements and, as a result, our business might suffer.\nBecause a significant portion of our revenue is recognized ratably over the terms of the contract, downturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our revenue.\nWe recognize our maintenance and subscriptions revenue monthly over the term of the customer agreement. Most of our maintenance agreements are for a one year term. Our subscription arrangements are typically either for a one year term or a three year term. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is attributable to agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in sales to new customers, renewals by existing customers or market acceptance of our products in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenues in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenues and profitability in future quarters.\nWe significantly increased our leverage in connection with acquisitions.\nWe incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with recent acquisitions. As a result of this indebtedness, our interest payment obligations have increased. The degree to which we are leveraged could have adverse effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nRequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nLimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nRestricting us from making additional strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nPlacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nLimiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nDecreasing our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we incur additional debt, these risks will intensify. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to the financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets could negatively affect our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $349.0 million and $229.3 million of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. If the carrying value of an asset is determined to be impaired, then it is written down to fair value by a non-cash charge to operating earnings. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to manage our anticipated growth effectively, our operating costs may increase and our operating margins may decrease.\nWe will need to continue to grow our infrastructure to address our acquisitions and other potential market opportunities. Our growth will continue to place, to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. If we continue to grow our operations, by way of additional business combinations or otherwise, we may not be effective in enlarging our physical facilities and our systems and our procedures or controls may not be adequate to support such expansion or our business generally. If we are unable to manage our growth, our operating costs may increase and our operating margins may decrease.\nOur quarterly financial results fluctuate and might be difficult to forecast and, if our future results are below either any guidance we might issue or the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the price of our common stock might decline.\nOur quarterly revenue and results of operations are difficult to forecast. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in revenue and operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons might not be accurate indicators of future performance. The reasons for these fluctuations include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nThe size and timing of sales of our software, including the relatively long sales cycles associated with many of our larger software sales;\n\u2022\nBudget and spending decisions by our customers;\n\u2022\nThe degree of judgment required to estimate large consulting service engagements;\n\u2022\nScheduling considerations by our customers as they impact the delivery of purchased services;\n\u2022\nVarying accounting treatments based upon the facts and circumstances of each arrangement;\n\u2022\nUtilization of our professional services personnel;\n\u2022\nMarket acceptance of new products we release or acquire;\n\u2022\nChanges in general economic conditions and conditions in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nCosts related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\nThe growth rates of certain market segments in which we compete;\n\u2022\nThe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;\n\u2022\nChanges in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition;\n\u2022\nThe rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force and the impact of reorganizations of our sales force;\n\u2022\nTechnical difficulties or interruptions in our service;\n\u2022\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nChanges in the effective tax rates due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, changes in federal, state or international tax laws and accounting principles, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that results in a recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period, results of tax examinations by local and foreign taxing authorities;\n\u2022\nExpenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events which are recorded in the period in which the events occur;\n\u2022\nRegulatory compliance costs; and\n\u2022\nExtraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nOur operating expenses, which include sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses, are based on our expectations of future revenue and are, to a large extent, fixed in the short term. If revenue falls below our expectations in a quarter and we are not able to quickly reduce our operating expenses in response, our operating results for that quarter could be adversely affected. It is possible that in some future quarter our operating results may be below either any guidance we might issue or the expectations of public market analysts and investors and, as a result, the price of our common stock might fall.\nRestrictions in our credit facility may limit our activities, including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions.\nOur credit facility contains restrictions, including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make acquisitions and other investments, prepay specified debt, consolidate, merge or acquire other businesses, sell assets, pay dividends and other distributions, repurchase stock and enter into transactions with affiliates. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.\nIn the event of a default under our credit facility, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings, which we might not be able to do. In addition, certain of our material domestic subsidiaries will be required to guarantee amounts borrowed under the credit facility, and we have pledged the shares of certain of our subsidiaries as collateral for our obligations under the credit facility. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, including allowing lenders under the credit facility to enforce guarantees of our subsidiaries, if any, or exercise their rights with respect to the shares pledged as collateral.\nOur business and financial performance could be negatively impacted by changes in tax laws or regulations.\nOur customers and we are subject to a wide variety of tax laws and regulations in jurisdictions around the world. New or revised income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to our customers or us. Any changes to these existing tax laws could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial performance. Additionally, these events could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require our customers or us to pay fines and/or penalties and interest for past amounts deemed to be due. Additionally, new, changed, modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could increase our customers' and our compliance, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our products. Any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nWe have recorded significant deferred tax assets, and we might never realize their full value, which would result in a charge against our earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had deferred tax assets of $56.8 million. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the tax benefit from those assets. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at least annually for realizability. A charge against our earnings would result if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This could be caused by, among other things, deterioration in performance, loss of key contracts, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products sold by our business and a variety of other factors. If a deferred tax asset was determined to be not realizable in a future period, the charge to earnings would be recognized as an expense in our results of operations in the period the determination is made. Additionally, if we are unable to utilize our deferred tax assets, our cash flow available to fund operations could be adversely affected.\nDepending on future circumstances, it is possible that we might never realize the full value of our deferred tax assets. Any future determination of impairment of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nIncluded in our deferred tax asset balance is $11.2 million related to federal net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2014. Our federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitations on how much may be utilized on an annual basis. The use of the net operating loss carryforwards may have additional limitations resulting from certain future ownership changes or other factors set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. If our net operating loss carryforwards are further limited, and we have taxable income that exceeds the available net operating loss carryforwards for that period, we would incur an income tax liability even though net operating loss carryforwards may be available in future years prior to their expiration, which would have an adverse effect on our future cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims that we or our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party may require us to incur significant costs, enter into royalty or licensing agreements or develop or license substitute technology.\nWe may in the future be subject to claims that our technologies in our products and services infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. In addition, the vendors providing us with technology that we use in our own technology could become subject to similar infringement claims. Although we believe that our products and services do not infringe any intellectual property or other proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that our products and services do not, or that they will not in the future, infringe intellectual property or other proprietary rights held by others. Any claims of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is without merit, and could distract our management from our business. Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from the claim could require us to pay substantial amounts, or obtain a license to continue to use the products and services that are the subject of the claim, and/or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms from the third party asserting any particular claim, or that we would be able to successfully develop alternative technology on a timely basis, or that we would be able to obtain a license from another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our customers to continue using, the products and services. In addition, we generally provide in our customer agreements for certain products and services that we will indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to technology we provide to those customers, which could obligate us to pay damages if the products and services were found to be infringing. Infringement claims asserted against us, our vendors or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur solutions utilize open source software, which may subject us to litigation, require us to re-engineer our solutions, or otherwise divert resources away from our development efforts.\nWe use open source software in connection with certain of our solutions. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses, including, for example, the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, \u201cApache-style\u201d licenses, \u201cBSD-style\u201d licenses and other open source licenses. There is little legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of some of these licenses, and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is currently unable to be determined and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and technologies. From time to time, companies that incorporate open source software into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to litigation by parties claiming ownership of open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their own software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur and we may be required to release proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our applications, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely upon trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights, which might not provide us with adequate protection.\nOur success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology rights. We might not be successful in protecting our proprietary technology and our proprietary rights might not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. To protect our core proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements, each of which affords only limited protection. We have no patent protection for The Raiser's Edge, which is one of our core products and responsible for a significant portion of our revenue. Any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition. It is possible that:\n\u2022\nAny patents issued to us may not be timely or broad enough to protect our proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nAny issued patent could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties, which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in those patents; and\n\u2022\nCurrent and future competitors may independently develop similar technologies, duplicate our products or design around any of our patents.\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights in our products to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite the measures taken by us, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology and information without authorization. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and litigation could become necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any litigation could be time consuming and expensive to prosecute or resolve, and could result in substantial diversion of management attention and resources and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the security of our software is breached, we fail to securely collect, store and transmit customer information, or we fail to safeguard confidential donor data, our products and services might be perceived as not being secure and our reputation and business could suffer.\nFundamental to the use of our products is the secure collection, storage and transmission of confidential donor and end user information, including in our payment processing business. The network and application security, internal control measures, and physical security procedures we employ to safeguard our systems may not be sufficient to prevent a security breach, intrusion, loss or theft of personal information, which may harm our business, reputation and future financial results. Any such breach may require significant resources to address, including notification under data privacy regulations.\nAdditionally, despite our efforts to combat such threats, computer hackers may attempt to penetrate or bypass our data protection and other security measures and gain unauthorized access to our networks, systems and data or compromise the confidential information of data of our customers. Computer hackers may be able to develop and deploy computer viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our products and services, create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers\u2019 data or our IT systems. These risks for us will increase as we continue to grow our cloud-based offerings and services, store and process increasingly large amounts of our customers\u2019 confidential information and data, host or manage parts of our customers\u2019 business in cloud-based IT environments and grow our payment processing business, especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences, financial services and the government. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquisitions, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these acquisitions within our business.\nA compromise of our data security that results in customer or donor personal or credit card information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. The existence of vulnerabilities, even if they do not result in a security breach, may harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address, and we may not be able to discover or remedy such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Also, computers, including those that use our software, are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions, delays or loss of data. We might be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect further against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach. Even though we carry cyber-technology insurance policies that may provide insurance coverage under certain circumstances, we might suffer losses as a result of a security breach that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage.\nPrivacy and security concerns, including evolving government regulation in the area of consumer data privacy, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe effectiveness of our software products relies on our customers' storage and use of data concerning their customers, including financial, personally identifying and other sensitive data. Our customers' collection and use of this data for donor profiling might raise privacy and security concerns and negatively impact the demand for our products and services. For example, our custom modeling and analytical services, including ProspectPoint, WealthPoint and donorCentrics, rely heavily on securing and making use of data we gather from various sources and privacy laws could jeopardize our ability to market and profit from those services.\nGovernments in some jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting consumer data privacy legislation, including laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing and use of consumer data. This legislation could reduce the demand for our software products if we fail to design or enhance our products to enable our customers to comply with the privacy and security measures required by the legislation. Moreover, we may be exposed to liability under existing or new consumer data privacy legislation. For example, we are subject to the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and might be subject to similar provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related regulations. Even technical violations of these laws can result in penalties that are assessed for each non-compliant transaction. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Congress passed the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HI-TECH Act. The HI-TECH Act expands the reach of data privacy and security requirements of HIPAA to service providers. HIPAA and associated United States Department of Health and Human Services regulations permit our customers in the healthcare industry to use certain demographic protected health information (such as name, email or physical address and dates of service) for fundraising purposes and to disclose that subset of protected health information to their service providers for fundraising. We may be included in this service provider group under the revised HIPAA regulations by virtue of our service provider relationship with our customers in the healthcare industry. In general, we seek to contractually prohibit our healthcare industry customers from using other types of health information of their clients for fundraising purposes that would be non-compliant with HIPAA, but we believe monitoring our healthcare customers' compliance with such prohibitions is not legally required of service providers and would be cost prohibitive. The law and regulations under HI-TECH are new and still subject to change or interpretation by legal authorities that could cause additional compliance burdens. If our customers or we were found to be subject to and in violation of any of these laws or other data privacy laws or regulations, our business could suffer and we and/or our customers would likely have to change our business practices. In addition, these laws and regulations could impose significant costs on our customers and us and make it more difficult for donors to make online donations.\nWe are in the information technology business, and our products and services store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers\u2019 information and data. The effectiveness of our software products relies on our customers\u2019 storage and use of data concerning their donors, including financial, personally identifying and other sensitive data and our business uses similar systems that require us to store and use data with respect to our customers and personnel. Our collection and our customers\u2019 collection and use of this data might raise privacy and security concerns and negatively impact our business or the demand for our products and services. If a breach of data security were to occur, our business may be materially and adversely impacted and products may be perceived as less desirable, which would negatively affect our business and operating results.\nIncreasing government regulation could affect our business.\nWe are subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally as well as laws and regulations directly applicable to electronic commerce and other regulations. State, federal and foreign governments may adopt new laws and regulations applicable to our business. Any such legislation or regulation could dampen the growth and decrease the acceptance of the Internet and online commerce. If such a decline occurs, companies may decide in the future not to use our products and services. Any new laws or regulations in the following areas, among others, could negatively affect our business:\n\u2022\nUser privacy;\n\u2022\nPayment processing;\n\u2022\nThe pricing and taxation of goods and services offered over the Internet;\n\u2022\nTaxation of foreign earnings;\n\u2022\nThe content of websites;\n\u2022\nCopyrights;\n\u2022\nConsumer protection, including the potential application of \u201cdo not call\u201d registry requirements on our customers and consumer backlash in general to direct marketing efforts of our customers;\n\u2022\nThe online distribution of specific material or content over the Internet; and\n\u2022\nThe characteristics and quality of products and services offered over the Internet.\nPending and enacted legislation at the state and federal levels, including those related to fundraising activities, may also restrict further our information gathering and disclosure practices, for example, by requiring us to comply with extensive and costly registration, reporting or disclosure requirements. Any substantial increase in government regulation affecting our business, or any failure to comply with existing regulations, could require substantial investments to achieve compliance, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nGeneral economic factors, both domestically and internationally, might adversely affect our financial performance.\nGeneral economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, might adversely affect our financial performance. Weakness in the financial and housing markets, inflation, higher levels of unemployment, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, overall economic slowdowns and other economic factors could adversely affect donations to nonprofits, reducing their revenue and, therefore, possibly their demand for the products and services we sell and lengthen our sales and payment cycles. In addition, these adverse economic conditions could reduce charitable transactions executed through our payments platform, which would adversely affect our revenue and net income. Higher interest rates, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the United States could increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results. These factors affect not only our operations, but also the operations of suppliers from whom we purchase or license products and services, a factor that could result in an increase in the cost to us of our products and services, reducing our margins. These factors also affect our customers who may reduce their purchasing of our solutions due to adverse effects of certain economic factors.\nOur operations might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nWe depend on our principal executive offices and other facilities for the continued operation of our business. Although we have contingency plans in effect for natural disasters or other catastrophic events, these events, including terrorist attacks, computer hacker attacks and natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, could disrupt one or more of these facilities and adversely affect our operations. Our principal executive offices are located in a coastal region that has experienced hurricanes in the past. Even though we carry business interruption insurance policies and typically have provisions in our commercial contracts that protect us in certain events, we might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us could have a significant negative impact on our operations.", "PERMNO": 90276, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "BLKB"}
