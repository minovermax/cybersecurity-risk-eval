{"cik": "1096325", "company": "INTERSIL CORP/DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risk factors listed below. In addition to these risks, other risks not now known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business could be materially harmed. If our business is harmed, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nAs discussed in \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d in Item 1 above, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements, including as a result of the risks described in the cautionary statements in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in our other filings with the SEC, and in material incorporated by reference. We undertake no duty to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nGlobal economic conditions and uncertainty, as well as the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, could adversely affect our revenue, operating results, cash flows, collectability of accounts receivable and supplier relationships, and our ability to access capital markets.\nAdverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the semiconductor industry generally, as well as in our end markets, which adversely affected our business and results of operations. In recent periods, market and business conditions in general have been adversely affected by investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook, including concerns about the rate of global economic recovery. This uncertainty poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products and services.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions, in which significant uncertainty currently exists. This uncertainty poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products and services.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical. The semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with product cycles of both semiconductor companies and their customers, but also related to declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by volatile customer demand, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Any future economic downturns could materially and adversely affect our business from one period to the next relative to demand and product pricing. In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced periods of increased demand, during which we may experience internal and external manufacturing constraints. We may experience substantial changes in future operating results due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may not be able to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry.\nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, manufacturing, marketing and sales resources. The current level of competition in the semiconductor market is high and may increase in the future. We currently compete directly with companies that have developed similar products, including but not limited to, Analog Devices, Linear Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, ON Semiconductor, and Texas Instruments. We also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative solutions. These direct and indirect competitors are established, multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies. Our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving and increasingly more complex area of IC technology depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022success in designing and manufacturing new products that implement new technologies;\n\u2022ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees;\n\u2022protection of our proprietary products, processes, trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022maintaining high product quality and reliability;\n\u2022pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022performance of competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022ability to deliver in large volume on a timely basis;\n\u2022marketing, manufacturing and distribution capability; and\n\u2022financial strength.\nTo the extent that our products achieve market success, competitors typically seek to offer competitive products or lower prices, which, if successful, could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain or expand our business depends on the successful development and market acceptance of new products\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles and continuous erosion of average selling prices. Consequently, our future success will be highly dependent upon our ability to continually develop new products using the latest and most cost-effective technologies, introduce our products in commercial quantities to the marketplace ahead of the competition and have our products selected for inclusion in leading system manufacturers' products. The development of new products will continue to require significant R&D expenditures.\nThe introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of the related revenues. The success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long-term market demand, future technological developments and a variety of specific implementation factors, including:\n\u2022timely and efficient completion of process design and development;\n\u2022timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes;\n\u2022product performance;\n\u2022the quality and reliability of the product; and\n\u2022effective marketing, sales and service.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute these elements of new product development our future results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to achieve design wins for our products with current and future customers and introduce new or improved products that meet customer needs while achieving favorable margins. A failure to develop, produce and market products in a timely manner, or to achieve market acceptance for these products, could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, such as reducing our revenue, increasing our costs, lowering our gross margin percentage, and ultimately leading to impairment of assets.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nA downturn in the computing end-market could cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results.\nA significant portion of our revenue (20.8%, 20.6% and 23.2% in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively) is derived from customers participating in the computing end-market. Any deterioration in this end market or our inability to compete for new solutions within the computing end market could lead to a reduction in demand for our products which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe consumer end market is characterized by rapid product obsolescence and requires that we develop and produce our products at the right time for our customers to fulfill demand for products in the consumer end market. If we are unable to forecast demand for our products, or we are unable to make and deliver products in a timely manner, our financial condition and results may be adversely affected.\nIn fiscal 2014, we derived 15.5% of our revenue from the consumer end market. This is the most competitive of our end markets and is characterized by high volumes, short life cycles and rapidly changing market requirements, products and customer demand. Our success in this market will depend principally on our ability to:\n\u2022predict technology and market trends;\n\u2022develop products on a timely basis; and\n\u2022meet the market windows for consumer products;\nIf we are unable to consistently perform the foregoing activities, our consumer business may not be able to sustain or grow revenues in the consumer end market.\nIn addition, sudden changes in customer demand requirements, order cancellations or delay in product shipments to consumer end market customers could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers, located around the world for raw materials and manufacturing services to manufacture our products, which can result in supply disruptions, sudden cost increases and delays beyond our control in delivering the products to our customers.\nProduction time and the cost of our products could increase if we were to lose one of our suppliers or if one of those suppliers increased the prices of raw materials. Our operating results could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of raw materials increased significantly. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis. We purchase raw materials, such as silicon wafers, from a limited number of suppliers on a just-in-time basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.\nWe use both internal wafer fabrication facilities and third-party wafer fabrication suppliers in manufacturing our products. We intend to continue to rely on third-party suppliers and other specialist suppliers for most of our manufacturing requirements. Many of these third-party suppliers are not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price. As a result, we cannot directly control semiconductor delivery schedules, which could lead to product shortages, quality assurance problems and increases in the cost of our products. We may experience delays and we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain semiconductors within the time frames and in the volumes required by us at an affordable cost or at all. Any disruption in the availability of wafers and other semiconductor materials or any problems associated with the delivery, quality or cost of the fabrication, assembly and testing of our products could significantly hinder our ability to deliver our products to our customers and may result in a decrease in sales of our products. If the third-party suppliers we use are unable to provide our products, we may be required to seek new suppliers and we cannot be certain that their services will be available at favorable terms or that sufficient capacity will be available within a reasonable time period.\nIn addition, the manufacture of our products is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a highly controlled environment. Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by a third-party supplier could adversely affect their ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. If our suppliers do not achieve adequate yields or product reliability, our customer relationships could suffer. This could ultimately lead to a loss of sales of our products and have a negative effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Additionally, our\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncontract manufacturers may decide to discontinue operations at a particular location or altogether, which will cause us to transfer those manufacturing operations elsewhere, which could disrupt the supply of products.\nDelays in production at new facilities, in implementing new production techniques or in curing problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions may lower yields and reduce our revenues and profitability.\nOur manufacturing processes are very complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously modified to improve yields and product performance. Impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our future profitability and we may not be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors.\nWe may experience difficulty in beginning production at new facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes. Resultant delays can be unpredictable and can result in late product deliveries and reduced yields. We may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues. Increases in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity may adversely affect our operating results if revenues do not increase proportionately.\nIf our products contain defects or fail to achieve industry reliability standards, our reputation may be harmed, and we may incur significant unexpected expenses and lose sales opportunities. Our insurance coverage for such events may be insufficient.\nSemiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced. We generally warrant our products for one year from the date of shipment by us. If any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our terms and conditions of sale or customer contracts. Our products may contain undetected errors or defects that may:\n\u2022cause delays in product introductions and shipments;\n\u2022result in increased costs and diversion of development resources;\n\u2022cause us to incur increased charges due to obsolete or unusable inventory;\n\u2022require design modifications; or\n\u2022decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with these products, resulting in product returns, recalls and lost sales.\nIn addition, we may not find defects or failures timely, which may result in loss or delay in market acceptance and could significantly harm our operating results. Our current or potential customers also might seek to recover from us any losses resulting from defects or failures in our products. Further, such claims might be significantly higher than the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved, as we are usually a component supplier with limited value content relative to the value of a complete system or sub-system. Liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages for which we may have insufficient insurance coverage. Any of these claims, whether or not successful, could seriously damage our reputation and business.\nProducts we manufacture and sell, or products formerly produced and sold by us and now manufactured and sold by purchasers of business that we have divested, may infringe other parties\u2019 IP rights. We may have to pay others for infringement and misappropriation of their IP rights, suspend the manufacture, use or sale of some affected products, or incur the cost of defending in litigation, resulting in significant expense to us.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of IP rights. We have received, and may receive in the future, notices of claims of infringement and misappropriation of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. In the event of an adverse decision in a patent, trademark, copyright, mask work or trade secret action, we could be required to withdraw the product or products found to be infringing from the market or redesign products offered for sale or under development. We have, at times, assumed indemnification obligations in favor of our customers that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of our infringement of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. We have also, at times, assumed indemnification obligations in favor of the purchasers of businesses that we have divested that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of infringement of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights by those purchasers.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThese indemnification obligations would be triggered for reasons including the sale or supply of a product that was later discovered to infringe another party\u2019s proprietary rights. Whether or not these infringement claims are successfully asserted, we would likely incur significant costs and diversion of our resources with respect to the defense of these claims. To address any potential claims or actions asserted against us or those we have indemnified, we may seek to obtain a license under a third-party\u2019s IP rights. However, in such an instance, a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Litigation could result in significant expense to us, adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technology and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not the litigation is determined in our favor. In the event of an adverse outcome in any litigation, we may be required to:\n\u2022pay substantial damages, which may include enhanced damages for willful infringement, and incur significant attorneys\u2019 fees;\n\u2022indemnify customers for damages they might suffer if the products they purchase from us infringe IP rights of others;\n\u2022indemnify purchasers of businesses that we have divested for damages they might suffer if certain of the products they sell infringe IP rights of others;\n\u2022stop our manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products;\n\u2022expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technology;\n\u2022discontinue the use of some processes; or\n\u2022obtain licenses to IP rights covering products and technology that may, or may have been found to, infringe or misappropriate such IP rights.\nIf we or our contract manufacturers suffer loss or significant damage to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system, and those of our contract manufacturers, are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake or other natural or man-made disasters. For example, our internal wafer fabrication facility is located on the east coast of Florida. Operations at this facility may experience disruptions during tropical storms and hurricanes. Further, our corporate headquarters is located near major earthquake fault lines in California and we have been unable to obtain earthquake insurance at reasonable costs and limits. A portion of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are located in the Pacific Rim region, a region with above average seismic and severe weather activity. Any catastrophic natural disaster in those regions or catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturers in those regions would likely disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and could materially and adversely affect our business. Such events could also result in significant expenses to repair or replace our affected facilities, and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market.\nWe use a significant amount of IP in our business. If we are unable to protect this IP, we could lose our right to prevent others from using our key technologies, resulting in decreased revenues.\nWe rely on IP rights to protect our technology. Our rights include, but not are limited to, rights existing under patent, trade secret, trademark, mask work and copyright law. Some of our technology is not covered by any patent or patent application, and there are risks that our patents may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.\nCompetitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around our patents. In addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright, mask work and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries.\nWe also seek to protect our proprietary technology, including technology that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors\u2019 rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. We cannot assure that these agreements will always be undertaken or will not be breached or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach.\nSome of our current licenses to use others\u2019 technology and IP are scheduled to expire periodically over the next several years, unless extended. We will need to negotiate renewals of these agreements or obtain the technology and IP from alternative sources. We may not be able to obtain alternative technology and IP, or renewals on substantially similar terms as those that currently exist or at all.\nThe failure to protect our IP, to extend its existing license agreements or utilize alternative technology could adversely affect our revenues.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations, including Export Control Regulations, U.S. Customs and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\nAs an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws include, among others, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) administered by the U.S. Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (DTCC), and trade sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control. Certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the ITAR, or represent so-called \u201cdual use\u201d items governed by the EAR. As a result, these products require individual validated licenses in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions. Any failures to properly classify products or otherwise comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties. Any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products. The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nWe are also subject to U.S. Customs Regulations and similar laws, which control import of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, we can provide no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of our products or other activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to recruit and retain highly skilled personnel.\nOur success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain highly-skilled technical, managerial, marketing and financial personnel. Highly-skilled employees are difficult to attract and retain in the highly-competitive semiconductor industry, and the failure to attract and retain such personnel could negatively impact our ability to keep pace with our competitors. Further, we have in the past several years announced certain cost reductions that included reductions in work force. These reductions in personnel, as well as any future cost reduction measures, could negatively impact morale, leading to unintended employee attrition and difficulty in recruiting personnel.\nMost of our distributors and value-added resellers can terminate their contract with us with little or no notice. The termination by a distributor or value-added reseller could result in a materially negative impact on our business, including revenue and accounts receivable.\nIn fiscal 2014, our distributors and value-added resellers accounted for 58.3% of our revenue. Our distributors can terminate their agreement with us with minimal notice. Two distributors accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2014. The termination of a significant distributor or reseller could impact our revenue and limit our access to certain end-customers. It could also result in the return of excess inventory. Since many distributors simply resell our products, they generally operate on low profit margins. If a distributor or reseller were to terminate their agreement or go out of business, our accounts receivable from them could be subject to collection risk.\nOur distribution channels recently have experienced consolidation due to merger and acquisition activity in that business sector. Consolidation may result in our distributors allocating fewer resources to the distribution and sale of our products, which could adversely affect our financial results. At times, our sales are concentrated in a small number of distributors, which are in various international locations and of various financial strengths. Financial difficulties, inability to access capital markets, or other reasons may affect our distributors' performance, which could materially harm our business and our operating results.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates, exposure to additional income tax liabilities or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns\nAs a global company, our effective income tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate, as well as our actual taxes payable, could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates. Our primary foreign operations are in Malaysia where we currently have a tax holiday resulting in a tax rate of 0%. This tax holiday began on July 1, 2009 and terminates on July 1, 2019. In order to retain this holiday in Malaysia, we must meet certain operating conditions, including compliance with warehouse and shipping quotas and specified manufacturing activities in Malaysia. Absent such tax incentives, the corporate income tax rate in Malaysia that would otherwise apply to us would be 25%. If we cannot or elect not to comply with these conditions, we could lose the related tax benefits. In such event, we may be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy. Any such modified structure or strategy may not be as beneficial as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangement. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNew regulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry (\u201cRCOI\u201d) and possibly also conduct due diligence, then disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) or adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these conflict minerals used in our products through the RCOI procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the minerals in our products are certified as DRC conflict-free.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.\nNon-U.S. sales accounted for 81.5% of our revenue in fiscal 2014. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant majority of our total revenue in future years. We are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations, and international sales are subject to risks including, but not limited to:\n\u2022increases in taxes, tariffs and governmental royalties,\n\u2022changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies,\n\u2022loss of revenue, equipment and property as a result of expropriation, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, boycotts, trade restrictions and other political risks,\n\u2022unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities;\n\u2022difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations;\n\u2022currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022trade balance issues;\n\u2022differences in our ability to acquire and enforce our IP and contract rights in varying jurisdictions; and\n\u2022the need for technical support resources in different locations.\nMany of the challenges noted above are applicable in China, which is a large and fast growing market for semiconductors and therefore an area of additional and continued growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China, Taiwan, Japan, and the United States, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with China and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia/Pacific region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material, adverse impact on our future revenue and profits.\nOur international operations may also be adversely affected by United States laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation. The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRestrictions in our revolving credit facility may limit our activities.\nOur current revolving credit facility may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in certain activities including our ability to enter into certain transactions, make investments or other specified restricted payments, pay certain dividends or repurchase our capital stock, create certain liens on our assets and incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. These covenants could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, respond to changing business and economic conditions or engage in other transactions or business activities that may be important to our growth strategy or otherwise important to us. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. If we breach any of the covenants under our credit facility or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness, if any, could be declared immediately due and payable. In addition, the lenders under our credit facility could institute foreclosure proceedings against the U.S. assets used to secure the borrowing under such facility.\nWe are subject to litigation risks.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to legal claims and are involved in a variety of routine legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. We believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operation. However, the claims process, and any ensuing litigation is inherently uncertain, unpredictable and expensive. An unfavorable resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.\nWe rely on information technology systems to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. We may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties. Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\nEnvironmental liabilities and other governmental regulatory matters could force us to expend significant capital and incur substantial costs.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous materials and the discharge of pollutants into the environment. We are also subject to laws relating to workplace safety and worker health which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Harris has agreed to indemnify us for all environmental liabilities related to events or activities occurring before our acquisition of their semiconductor business. This indemnification does not expire, nor is it subject to a dollar limitation.\nBased on our experience, we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws (and liability for known environmental conditions) even without the indemnification from Harris will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, we cannot predict:\n\u2022what environmental or health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future;\n\u2022how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted;\n\u2022the amount of future expenditures which may be required to comply with these environmental or health and safety laws or to respond to future cleanup matters or other environmental claims; or\n\u2022the extent of our obligations to the purchasers of our environmentally challenged sites.", "PERMNO": 87612, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "ISIL"}
