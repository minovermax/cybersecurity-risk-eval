{"cik": "795212", "company": "Kaspien Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following is a discussion of certain factors, which could affect the financial results of the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we cannot successfully implement our business strategy our growth and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nOur future results will depend, among other things, on our success in implementing our business strategy. The ability of the Company to meet its liabilities and to continue as a going concern is dependent on improved profitability, the continued implementation of the strategic initiative to reposition Kaspien as a platform of software and services, the availability of future funding and overcoming the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in further implementing our business strategy or that the strategy, including the completed initiatives, will be successful in sustaining acceptable levels of sales growth and profitability. Based on recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, the expectation of continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future, negative cash flows for operations and uncertainty with respect to any available future funding, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nContinued increases in Amazon Marketplace fulfillment and storage fees could have an adverse impact on our profit margin and results of operations.\nThe Company utilizes Amazon\u2019s Freight by Amazon (\u201cFBA\u201d) platform to store their products at the Amazon fulfillment center and to pack and distribute these products to customers. If Amazon continues to increase its FBA fees, our profit margin could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to build and maintain strong product listings on e-commerce platforms. We may not be able to maintain and enhance our product listings if we receive unfavorable customer complaints, negative publicity, or otherwise fail to live up to consumers\u2019 expectations, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\nMaintaining and enhancing our product listings is critical in expanding and growing our business. However, a significant portion of our perceived performance to the customer depends on third parties outside of our control, including suppliers and third-party delivery agents as well as online retailers such as Amazon and Walmart. Because our agreements with our online retail partners are generally terminable at will, we may be unable to maintain these relationships, and our results of operations could fluctuate significantly from period to period. Because we rely on third parties to deliver our products, we are subject to shipping delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather, natural disasters, labor activism, health epidemics or bioterrorism. We may also experience shipping delays or disruptions due to other carrier-related issues relating to their own internal operational capabilities. Further, we rely on the business continuity plans of these third parties to operate during pandemics, like the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have limited ability to influence their plans, prevent delays, and/or cost increases due to reduced availability and capacity and increased required safety measures.\nCustomer complaints or negative publicity about our products, delivery times, or marketing strategies, even if not accurate, especially on blogs, social media websites and third-party market sites, could rapidly and severely diminish consumer view of our product listings and result in harm to our brands. Customers may also make safety-related claims regarding products sold through our online retail partners, such as Amazon, which may result in an online retail partner removing the product from its marketplace. We have from time to time experienced such removals and such removals may materially impact our financial results depending on the product that is removed and length of time that it is removed. We also use and rely on other services from third parties, such as our telecommunications services, and those services may be subject to outages and interruptions that are not within our control.\nA change in one or more of the Company\u2019s partners\u2019 policies or the Company\u2019s relationship with those partners could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on its partners to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. If a partner fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, the Company could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales.\nHistorically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory sources of supply and management believes that it will continue to have access to adequate sources of supply. The Company had one vendor that represented 11.0% of net revenue in fiscal 2021.\nOur revenue is dependent upon maintaining our relationship with Amazon and failure to do so, or any restrictions on our ability to offer products on the Amazon Marketplace, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company generates substantially all its revenue through the Amazon Marketplace. Therefore, we depend in large part on our relationship with Amazon for growth. In particular, we depend on our ability to offer products on the Amazon Marketplace. We also depend on Amazon for the timely delivery of products to customers. Any adverse change in our relationship with Amazon, including restrictions on the ability to offer products or termination of the relationship, could adversely affect our continued growth and financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and we may continue to incur additional debt in the future. As of January 29, 2022, the Company had borrowings of $10.0 million under our credit facility with Eclipse. We also had borrowings of $4.4 million under our Subordinated Debt facility, with interest accruing at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum and compounded on the last day of each calendar quarter by becoming a part of the principal amount. On March 2, 2022, we incurred an additional $5.0 million under our Subordinated Debt Facility, with interest accruing at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum and compounded on the last day of each calendar quarter by becoming a part of the principal amount. Substantially all of our assets, including the capital stock of Kaspien is pledged to secure our indebtedness. This leverage also exposes us to significant risk by limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business (whether through competitive pressure or otherwise), our industry and the economy at large. In addition, our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, such debt, and to fund our operating and capital expenditures, depends largely upon our future operating performance. Our future operating performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nThe terms of our asset-based revolving credit agreement and subordinated debt agreement impose certain restrictions on us that may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Additionally, our business could suffer if our ability to acquire financing is reduced or eliminated.\nOn February 20, 2020, Kaspien entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) with Eclipse, as administrative agent, under which the lenders committed to provide up to $25 million in loans under a four-year, secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). On March 30, 2020, we entered into a Subordinated Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cSubordinated Loan Agreement\u201d) with the lenders party thereto from time to time (the \u201cLenders\u201d) and TWEC Loan Collateral Agent, LLC (\u201cCollateral Agent\u201d), as collateral agent for the Lenders, pursuant to which the Lenders made a $5.2 million secured term loan (the \u201cSubordinated Loan\u201d) to Kaspien. We subsequently amended the Subordinated Loan to add an additional $5.0 million secured term loan.\nAmong other things, the Loan Agreement and Subordinated Loan Agreement limit Kaspien\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, make restricted payments or specified payments and merge or acquire assets. The Loan Agreement also requires Kaspien to comply with a financial maintenance covenant.\nThe Loan Agreement and Subordinated Loan Agreement contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other obligations, customary ERISA defaults, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, judgment defaults, the invalidity of liens on collateral, change in control, cessation of business or the liquidation of material assets of the borrowers and guarantors taken as a whole, the occurrence of an uninsured loss to a material portion of collateral and, in the case of the Credit Facility, failure of the obligations to constitute senior indebtedness under any applicable subordination or intercreditor agreements, including our Subordinated Debt.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual Property\nBreach of data security could harm our business and standing with our customers.\nThe protection of our partner, employee and business data is critical to us. Our business, like that of most companies, involves confidential information about our employees, our suppliers and our Company. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of all such data, including confidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means, including deceiving our employees or third-party service providers. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect. We have implemented and regularly review and update our control systems, processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of customer payment card or personal information or employee personal or confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could damage our reputation, expose us to risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, harm our business and have an adverse impact upon our net sales and profitability. As the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. Further, if we are unable to comply with the security standards established by banks and the credit card industry, we may be subject to fines, restrictions and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could adversely affect our retail operations.\nOur hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage, theft or intrusion that could harm our business.\nAny failure of our computer hardware or software systems that causes an interruption in our operations or a decrease in inventory tracking could result in reduced net sales and profitability. Additionally, if any data intrusion, security breach, misappropriation or theft were to occur, we could incur significant costs in responding to such event, including responding to any resulting claims, litigation or investigations, which could harm our operating results.\nOur inability or failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or any claimed infringement by us of third-party intellectual rights, could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nOur trademark, trade secrets and other intellectual property, including proprietary software, are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could cause a decline in our revenue. In addition, any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us could be time-consuming to address, result in costly litigation, cause product delays, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or result in our loss of ownership or use of the intellectual property.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nLoss of key personnel or the inability to attract, train and retain qualified employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company believes that its future prospects depend, to a significant extent, on the services of its executive officers. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified key personnel. The loss of the services of certain of the Company\u2019s executive officers and other key management personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn addition to our executive officers, the Company\u2019s business is dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified team members. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, health care costs and changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members, our operations and support functions could suffer. Those factors, together with increased wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may face difficulties in meeting our labor needs to effectively operate our business.\nWe are heavily dependent upon our labor workforce. Our compensation packages are designed to provide benefits commensurate with our level of expected service. However, we face the challenge of filling many positions at wage scales that are appropriate to the industry and competitive factors. We also face other risks in meeting our labor needs, including competition for qualified personnel, overall unemployment levels, and increased costs associated with complying with regulations relating to COVID-19. Changes in any of these factors, including a shortage of available workforce, could interfere with our ability to adequately service our customers and could result in increasing labor costs.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs, including costs related to an increase in minimum wage and health care.\nLabor is one of the primary components in the cost of operating our business. Increased labor costs, whether due to competition, unionization, increased minimum wage, state unemployment rates, health care, or other employee benefits costs may adversely impact our operating expenses. Additionally, there is no assurance that future health care legislation will not adversely impact our results or operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock.\nThe ownership of our Common Stock is concentrated, and entities affiliated with members of our Board of Directors have significant influence and control over the outcome of any vote of the Company\u2019s shareholders and may have competing interests.\nThe Robert J. Higgins TWMC Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) owns approximately 28.8% of the outstanding Common Stock and Neil Subin owns approximately 18.1% of the outstanding Common Stock, and as a result each can significantly influence the outcome of most actions requiring shareholder approval. In addition, entities affiliated with each of the Trust and Mr. Subin, as well as one of our directors, Mr. Simpson, and certain of his affiliated entities, collectively hold approximately 51.6% of the outstanding Common Stock, and as a result can control the outcome of most actions requiring shareholder approval.\nIf all of the outstanding warrants described in \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d were exercised, Neil Subin and his affiliated entities would own approximately 27.4% of the outstanding Common Stock, and as a result each can significantly influence the outcome of most actions requiring shareholder approval. If all of the outstanding warrants described in \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d were exercised, entities affiliated with each of the Trust, Mr. Subin, as well as one of our directors, Mr. Simpson, and certain of his affiliated entities, would collectively hold approximately 57.0% of the outstanding Common Stock, and as a result can control the outcome of nearly all actions requiring shareholder approval,\nThese shareholders entered into a voting agreement (as described in \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d) and agreed to how their respective shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock held by the parties will be voted with respect to the designation, election, removal, and replacement of members of the Board. Pursuant to the voting agreement, Messrs. Marcus and Simpson were appointed as directors of the Company, and Mr. Reickert, a trustee of the Trust, remained as a director of the Company. Mr. Subin was also granted board observer rights.\nEntities affiliated with the Trust and Messrs. Marcus and Simpson are also lenders under our subordinated loan and security agreement, have received warrants to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and received contingent value rights (\u201cCVRs\u201d) representing the contractual right to receive cash payments from the Company in an amount equal, in the aggregate, to 19.9% of the proceeds received by the Company in respect of certain intercompany indebtedness owing to it by Kaspien and/or its equity interest in Kaspien, each as described in \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d. In addition, entities affiliated with Mr. Marcus received an additional CVR representing the contractual right to receive cash payments from the Company in an amount equal to 9.0% of the proceeds received by the Company in respect of certain distributions by the Company or Kaspien; recapitalizations or financings of the Company or Kaspien (with appropriate carve out for trade financing in the ordinary course); repayment of intercompany indebtedness owing to the Company by Kaspien; or sale or transfer of any stock of the Company or Kaspien, as described in \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d. As a result, there may be instances in which the interest of Mr. Reickert, the Trust and its affiliated entities, Messrs. Marcus and Subin and their respective affiliated entities, and Mr. Simpson and his affiliated entities may conflict or be perceived as being in conflict with the interest of a holder of our securities or the interest of the Company.\nThe holders of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution due to our corporate financing practices.\nThe holders of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution due to our corporate financing practices, which, in the past few years, have included a registered direct offering, the issuance of warrants and the issuance of contingent value rights.\nIf all of the outstanding warrants were exercised, an additional 325,126 shares of common stock would be issued and outstanding. This additional issuance of shares of common stock would cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and could cause a significant reduction in the market price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, lenders under our subordinated loan and security agreement, have received contingent value rights (\u201cCVRs\u201d) representing the contractual right to receive cash payments from the Company in an amount equal, in the aggregate, to 19.9% of the proceeds received by the Company in respect of certain intercompany indebtedness owing to it by Kaspien and/or its equity interest in Kaspien, each as described in \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d. In addition, certain lenders received an additional CVR representing the contractual right to receive cash payments from the Company in an amount equal to 9.0% of the proceeds received by the Company in respect of certain distributions by the Company or Kaspien; recapitalizations or financings of the Company or Kaspien (with appropriate carve out for trade financing in the ordinary course); repayment of intercompany indebtedness owing to the Company by Kaspien; or sale or transfer of any stock of the Company or Kaspien, as described in \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d. If events triggering these payments occur, the amount of consideration received by the Company will be reduced, thereby reducing any amounts distributable or attributable to shareholders or their shares.\nThe issuance of any securities for acquisition or financing efforts, upon exercise of warrants, pursuant to our equity compensation plans, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional securities, such issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current shareholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change in control of our Company.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced and could continue to experience volatility and could decline, resulting in a substantial loss on your investment.\nOur stock price has experienced, and could continue to experience in the future, substantial volatility as a result of many factors, including global economic conditions, broad market fluctuations and public perception of the prospects for the industries in which we operate and the value of our assets. We are reliant on the performance of Kaspien, and a failure to meet market expectations, particularly with respect to net revenues, operating margins and earnings per share, would likely result in a further decline in the market price of our stock.\nIf we do not meet the continued listing standards of the NASDAQ, our Common Stock could be delisted from trading, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our Common Stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common stock is listed on NASDAQ, which imposes continued listing requirements with respect to listed shares. If we fail to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements in the future and NASDAQ determines to delist our Common Stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our Common Stock and reduce our ability to raise additional capital.\nThe limited public float and trading volume for our Common Stock may have an adverse impact and cause significant fluctuation of market price.\nHistorically, ownership of a significant portion of our outstanding shares of Common Stock has been concentrated in a small number of shareholders. Consequently, our Common Stock has a relatively small float and low average daily trading volume, which could affect a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell our stock or the price at which it can be sold. In addition, future sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market by those larger shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely impact the market price of the stock and our stock could be difficult for a shareholder to liquidate.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business is influenced by general economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. General economic conditions impacting discretionary consumer spending include, among others, wages and employment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. A downturn in the economy affects retailers disproportionately, as consumers may prioritize reductions in discretionary spending, which could have a direct impact on purchases of our products and services and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, reduced consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on gross profit.\nDisruption of global capital and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and capital resources.\nDistress in the financial markets has in the past and can in the future result in extreme volatility in security prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability. There can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs.\nBecause of our floating rate credit facility, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\nOur financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as the Credit Facility is subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. As we borrow against our credit facility, a significant increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent upon access to capital, including bank credit facilities and short-term vendor financing, for its liquidity needs.\nThe Company must have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund its working capital requirements and indebtedness. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, permissibility under our existing financing arrangements, the availability of credit and the Company\u2019s credit rating, as well as the Company\u2019s reputation with potential lenders. These factors could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to fund its working capital requirements, costs of borrowing, and the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nWe may complete a future significant strategic transaction that may not achieve intended results or could increase the number of our outstanding shares or amount of outstanding debt or result in a change of control.\nWe will evaluate and may in the future enter into strategic transactions. Any such transaction could happen at any time following the closing of the merger, could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition, merger or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nEvaluating potential transactions and integrating completed ones may divert the attention of our management from ordinary operating matters. The success of these potential transactions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our existing business. Even if we are successful in integrating the acquired businesses, we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames. In addition, acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\nIf we complete an acquisition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional financing that could result in an increase in the number of our outstanding shares or the aggregate principal amount of our debt. A strategic transaction may result in a change in control of our company or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business.\nHistorically, we have experienced declines, and we may continue to experience fluctuation in our level of sales and results from operations.\nA variety of factors has historically affected, and will continue to affect, our sales results and profit margins. These factors include general economic conditions; competition; actions taken by our competitors; consumer trends and preferences; access to third party marketplaces; and new product introductions and changes in our product mix.\nThere is no assurance that we will achieve positive levels of sales and earnings growth, and any decline in our future growth or performance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe ability of the Company to satisfy its liabilities and to continue as a going concern will continue to be dependent on the implementation of several items, the success of which is not certain.\nThe Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and the Company\u2019s primary sources of liquidity are borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility, available cash and cash equivalents, all of which are limited. Therefore, the ability of the Company to meet its liabilities and to continue as a going concern is dependent on, among other things, improved profitability, the continued implementation of the strategic initiative to reposition Kaspien as a platform of software and services, the availability of future funding, implementation of one or more corporate initiatives to reduce costs at the parent company level and other strategic alternatives, including selling all or part of the remaining business or assets of the Company, and overcoming the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in further implementing our business strategy or that the strategy, including the completed initiatives, will be successful in sustaining acceptable levels of sales growth and profitability. Based on recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, the expectation of continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future, negative cash flows from operations and uncertainty with respect to any available future funding, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nParties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.\nThe Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including partners, vendors, suppliers, service providers and lenders, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits, including with respect to merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Company\u2019s business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Economic, industry and market conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in increased risks to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. The Company is not currently able to accurately determine the extent and scope of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Company\u2019s existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Significant legislative changes that impact our relationship with our workforce (none of which is represented by unions) could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible legislative changes impacting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer\u2019s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining units are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, health care mandates, and changes in overtime regulations.\nOur policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ Capital Market, as well as applicable employment laws. Additional legal and regulatory requirements increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in damage to our reputation, financial condition and market price of our stock.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, partners, suppliers, competitors, stockholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. We may incur losses relating to these claims, and in addition, these proceedings could cause us to incur costs and may require us to devote resources to defend against these claims that could adversely affect our results of operations. For a description of current legal proceedings, see \u201cPart I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nThe effects of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, and public health issues may adversely affect our business.\nNatural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes may affect store and distribution center operations. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, and military action both in the United States and abroad can have a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to purchase merchandise from suppliers for sale to our customers. Public health issues, such as flu or other pandemics, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations and result in a significant part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. Additionally, public health issues may disrupt, or have an adverse effect on, our suppliers\u2019 operations, our operations, our customers, or customer demand. Our ability to mitigate the adverse effect of these events depends, in part, upon the effectiveness of our disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning. However, we cannot be certain that our plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an actual disaster. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any significant declines in public safety or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect customer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on customer purchases of our products.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, may materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted if a public health outbreak, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, interferes with our ability, or the ability of our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, resulting in an economic downturn that could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, our ability to fund through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and through other means at acceptable terms, if at all, may be disrupted, in the event our financing needs for the foreseeable future are not able to be met by our Credit Facility, balances of cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.\nIn addition, the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and various governmental responses in the United States has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business operations, including our ability to carry on business development activities, restrictions in business-related travel, delays or disruptions in our on-going projects, and unavailability of the employees of the Company or third parties with whom we conduct business, due to illness or quarantines, among others. Our business was negatively impacted by disruptions in our supply chain, which limited our ability to source merchandise, and limits on products fulfillment placed by Amazon. For example, we may be unable to launch new products, replenish inventory for existing products, ship into or receive inventory in our third-party warehouses in each case on a timely basis or at all. During fiscal 2021, we experienced production and shipment delays for certain of our products that resulted in stock outs on the Amazon marketplace resulting in a decrease of net revenue. During 2021, the global shipping disruption led to substantial increases in supply chain costs and reduced the reliability and timely delivery of our shipping containers. The extent to which COVID-19 could impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, and will depend on many factors, including the duration of the outbreak, the effect of travel restrictions and social distancing efforts in the United States and other countries, the scope and length of business closures or business disruptions, and the actions taken by governments to contain and treat the disease. As such, we cannot presently predict the scope and extent of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions. Possible effects may include, but are not limited to, disruption to our customers and revenue, absenteeism in our labor workforce, unavailability of products and supplies used in our operations, shutdowns that may be mandated or requested by governmental authorities, and a decline in the value of our assets, including various long-lived assets.", "PERMNO": 10514, "SIC": 5735, "TIC": "KSPN"}
