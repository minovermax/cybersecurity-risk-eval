{"cik": "1084048", "company": "J2 GLOBAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBefore deciding to invest in j2 Global or to maintain or increase your investment, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, including our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock will likely decline and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe rely heavily on the revenue generated by our fax services.\nCurrently, a substantial portion of our revenue is fax-to-email related and constitutes 42% of our consolidated revenues. Our business' success is therefore dependent upon the continued use of fax as a messaging medium and/or our ability to diversify our service offerings and derive more revenue from other services, such as voice, online backup, email, unified messaging solutions and services related to our Digital Media segment. If the demand for online fax-to-email as a messaging medium decreases, and we are unable to replace lost revenues from decreased usage or cancellation of our fax services with a proportional increase in our customer base or with revenues from our other services, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that one of the attractive features of our eFax\u00ae and similar products is that fax signatures are a generally accepted method of executing contracts. There are on-going efforts by governmental and non-governmental entities to create a universally accepted method for electronically signing documents. Widespread adoption of so-called \u201cdigital signatures\u201d could reduce demand for our fax services and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWeakness in the economy has adversely affected and may adversely affect segments of our customers, which has resulted and may result in decreased usage and advertising levels, customer acquisitions and customer retention rates and, in turn, could lead to a decrease in our revenues or rate of revenue growth.\nCertain segments of our customers have been and may be adversely affected by weakness in the general economy and the slow pace of recovery. To the extent these customers' businesses are adversely affected by an economic downturn, their usage of our services and/or our customer retention rates would decline. This may result in decreased cloud services subscription and/or usage revenues and decreased advertising or e-commerce revenues in our Digital Media segment, which may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.\nIn order to sustain our growth, we must continue to engage in acquisitions that could result in dilution, operating difficulties and other harmful consequences, and may require us to incur additional indebtedness.\nWe must acquire or invest in additional businesses, products, services and technologies that complement or augment our service offerings and customer base in order to sustain our growth. We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, integrate or manage disparate technologies, lines of business, personnel and corporate cultures, realize our business strategy or the expected return on our investment, or manage a geographically dispersed company. If we are unable to identify and execute on acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully, our revenues, business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could suffer. Moreover, acquisitions could divert attention from management and from other business concerns and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities or unfavorable accounting treatment. In addition, we may lose key employees while integrating any new companies, and we may have difficulties entering new markets where we have no or limited prior experience. Further, while we conduct due diligence in connection with acquisition opportunities, there may be risks or liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. The discovery of material liabilities associated with acquisitions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may pay for some acquisitions by issuing additional common stock or other equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders, or incur debt, which may cause us to incur additional interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements. We may also use cash to make acquisitions, which may limit our availability of cash for other uses, such as interest payments, stock repurchases or dividends. We will be required to review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in connection with past and future acquisitions, which may materially increase operating expenses if an impairment issue is identified.\nThe majority of our revenue within the Digital Media segment is derived from short-term advertising arrangements and a reduction in spending by or loss of current or potential advertisers would cause our revenue and operating results to decline.\nIn most cases, our agreements with advertisers have a term of less than one year and may be terminated at any time by the advertiser or by us without penalty. Advertising agreements often provide that we receive payment based on \"served\" impressions but the online ad industry has started to shift so that payment will be made based on \"viewable\" impressions, and that change in basis could have a negative effect on available impressions thereby reducing our revenue potential. Accordingly, it is difficult to forecast display revenue accurately. In addition, our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue. Moreover, we believe that advertising on the Internet, as in traditional media, fluctuates significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of these factors include budget constraints of our advertisers, cancellations or delays of projects by our advertisers, the cyclical and discretionary nature of advertising spending, general economic, Internet-related and media industry conditions, as well as extraordinary events. The state of the global economy and availability of capital has impacted and could further impact the advertising spending patterns of existing and potential advertisers. Any reduction in spending by, or loss of, existing or potential advertisers would negatively impact our revenue and operating results. Further, we may be unable to adjust our expenses and capital expenditures quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall.\nIf we are unable to develop or commission compelling content in our Digital Media segment at acceptable prices, our expenses may increase, the number of visitors to our online properties may not grow as anticipated, or may decline, and/or visitors' level of engagement with our websites may decline, any of which could harm our operating results.\nOur future success depends in part on the ability of our Digital Media segment to aggregate compelling content and deliver that content through our online properties. We believe that users will increasingly demand high-quality content and services including more video and mobile-specific content. Such content and services may require us to make substantial payments to third parties if we are unable to develop content of our own. Our ability to maintain and build relationships with such third-party providers is critical to our success. In addition, as new methods for accessing the Internet become available, including through alternative devices, we may need to enter into amended agreements with existing third-party providers to cover the new devices. We may be unable to monetize the activity on these alternative devices including mobile devices which may supplant current traffic that we monetize. We may be unable to enter into new, or preserve existing, relationships with the third-parties whose content or services we seek to obtain. In addition, as competition for compelling content increases both domestically and internationally, our third-party providers may increase the prices at which they offer their content and services to us and potential providers may not offer their content or services to us at all, or may offer them on terms that are not agreeable to us. An increase in the prices charged to us by third-party providers could harm our operating results and financial condition. Further, many of our content and services licenses with third parties are non-exclusive. Accordingly, other media providers may be able to offer similar or identical content. This increases the importance of our ability to deliver compelling content and personalization of this content for users in order to differentiate our properties from other businesses. If we are unable to develop compelling content of our own, we may be required to engage freelance services or obtain licensed content which may not be at reasonable prices which could harm our operating results.\nUsers are increasingly using mobile devices to access our content within our Digital Media business segment and if we are unsuccessful in attracting new users to our mobile offerings, and expanding the capabilities of our content and other offerings with respect to our mobile platforms, our net revenues could decline.\nWeb usage and the consumption of digital content are increasingly shifting to mobile platforms such as smartphones and other connected devices. Visits to our mobile websites and applications have increased but if the percentage of visits to our mobile websites does not continue to grow or we are unable to effectively monetize our mobile content, net revenue will be impacted. In addition, we are less effective at monetizing digital offer content on our mobile websites and applications compared to our desktop websites.\nThe growth of our business depends in part on our ability to continue to adapt to the mobile environment and to deliver compelling solutions to consumers and retailers through these new mobile marketing channels. In addition, our success on mobile platforms will be dependent on our interoperability with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, and any changes in such systems that degrade our functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive services could adversely affect usage of our services through mobile devices.\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities which may adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are a U.S. based multinational company subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. Our provision for income taxes is based on a jurisdictional mix of earnings, statutory tax rates and enacted tax rules, including transfer pricing. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. As a result, our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. For example, the Irish tax authorities announced changes to the treatment of non-resident Irish entities, commonly used in a \u201cdouble Irish\u201d structure. The changes will impact newly created Irish entities immediately but are not expected to impact existing non-resident Irish entities, such as ours, until after December 31, 2020. These changes may adversely impact our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development recently released draft guidance covering various topics, including addressing the \u201ctax challenges of the digital economy,\u201d country-by-country reporting, and definitional changes to permanent establishment, which could ultimately impact our tax liabilities to foreign jurisdictions and treatment of our foreign earnings from a U.S. perspective which may adversely impact our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under audit by the IRS, the California Franchise Tax Board (\u201cFTB\u201d) for tax years 2012 and 2013, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance for tax years 2011 through 2013, and the New York City Department of Finance for years 2009 through 2011. However, the FTB audit has been suspended pending the outcome of the IRS audit for the same tax years. We are also under audit or review by other state and foreign taxing authorities for various periods. Our future income tax returns are likely to become the subject of audits by these or other taxing authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense. If our reserves are not sufficient to cover these contingencies, such inadequacy could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur business, customers and users may be subject to telecommunications and sales taxes.\nAs a provider of cloud services for business, we do not provide telecommunications services. Thus, we believe that our business and our users (by using our services) are not subject to various telecommunications and utility taxes. However, several state taxing authorities have challenged this belief and have and may continue to audit and assess our business and operations with respect to telecommunications and sales taxes.\nIn addition, the application of other indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, business tax and gross receipt tax) to e-commerce businesses such as j2 Global and our users is a complex and evolving issue.\nIn November 2007, the U.S. federal government enacted legislation extending the moratorium on states and other local authorities imposing access or discriminatory taxes on the Internet through December 2015 (subsequently extended through October 1, 2016). This moratorium does not prohibit federal, state or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting taxes that are due under existing tax rules. The application of existing, new or future laws could have adverse effects on our business, prospects and operating results. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business. We are currently under audit for indirect taxes in several states and municipalities. We currently have no financial reserves established with respect to indirect taxes, as we have determined that the liability is not probable and estimable. As a result, if a material indirect tax liability associated with prior periods were to be recorded, it could materially affect our financial results for the period in which it is recorded.\nMuch of our Digital Media e-commerce revenue comes from arrangements in which we are paid by retailers to promote their digital product and service offers on our sites. Certain states have implemented regulations that require retailers to collect and remit sales taxes on sales made to residents of such states if a publisher, such as us, that facilitated that sale is a resident of such state. Paid retailers in our marketplace that do not currently have sales tax nexus in any state that subsequently passes similar regulations and in which we have operations, employees or contractors now or in the future, may significantly alter the manner in which they pay us, cease paying us for sales we facilitate for that retailer in such state, or cease using our marketplace, each of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA system failure, security breach or other technological risk could delay or interrupt service to our customers, harm our reputation or subject us to significant liability.\nOur operations are dependent on our network being free from interruption by damage from fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or any other events beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our existing and planned precautions of backup systems, regular data backups, security protocols and other procedures will be adequate to prevent significant damage, system failure or data loss. Also, many of our services are web-based, and the amount of data we store for our users on our servers has been increasing. Despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses, hackers or similar disruptive problems caused by our subscribers, employees or other Internet users who attempt to invade public and private data networks. As seen in the industries in which we operate and others, these activities have been, and will continue to be, subject to continually evolving cybersecurity and technological risks. Further, in some cases we do not have in place disaster recovery facilities for certain ancillary services. Moreover, a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other sensitive data. For example, a significant number of our cloud services customers authorize us to bill their credit or debit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us. We rely on encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information, including customer credit and debit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect transaction and other confidential data. Any system failure or security breach that causes interruptions or data loss in our operations or in the computer systems of our customers or leads to the misappropriation of our or our customers' confidential information could result in a significant liability to us (including in the form of judicial decisions and/or settlements, regulatory findings and/or forfeitures, and other means), cause considerable harm to us and our reputation (including requiring notification to customers, regulators, and/or the media) and deter current and potential customers from using our services. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIncreased numbers of credit and debit card declines in our cloud business could lead to a decrease in our cloud business revenues or rate of revenue growth.\nA significant number of our paid cloud services subscribers pay for their services through credit and debit cards. Weakness in certain segments of the credit markets and in the U.S. and global economies could result in increased numbers of rejected credit and debit card payments. We believe this could result in increased cloud services customer cancellations and decreased customer signups. Rejected credit or debit card payments, cloud services customer cancellations and decreased customer sign up may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.\nIf our Business Cloud Services segment experiences excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card company merchant standards, we could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment and our subscriber base could decrease significantly.\nA significant number of our paid cloud services subscribers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all service fees charged by us. If people pay for these services with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial unreimbursed third-party vendor costs. We also incur losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction to purchase our service. If the numbers of unauthorized credit card transactions become excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks and could lose the right to accept credit cards for payment. In addition, we are subject to Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) data security standards, which require periodic audits by independent third parties to assess our compliance. PCI standards are a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security. Failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines or a restriction on accepting payment cards. Credit card companies may change the standards required to utilize their services from time to time. If we are unable to meet these new standards, we could be unable to accept credit cards. Further, the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled and states may enact their own rule with which we may not comply. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card payments, which could cause our paid cloud services subscriber base to significantly decrease, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and our competitors may have greater resources to commit to growth, superior technologies, cheaper pricing or more effective marketing strategies. Also, we face significant competition for users, advertisers, publishers, developers and distributors.\nFor information regarding our competition, and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section entitled Competition contained in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, some of our competitors include major companies with much greater resources and significantly larger subscriber bases than we have. Some of these competitors offer their services at lower prices than we do. These companies may be able to develop and expand their network infrastructures and capabilities more quickly, adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we can. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter markets that we are currently serving and plan to serve or that we will be able to compete effectively. Competitive pressures may reduce our revenue, operating profits or both.\nOur Digital Media segment faces significant competition from online media companies as well as from social networking sites, traditional print and broadcast media, general purpose and search engines and various e-commerce sites.\nSeveral of our competitors offer an integrated variety of Internet products, advertising services, technologies, online services and content. We compete against these and other companies to attract and retain users, advertisers and developers. We also compete with social media and networking sites which are attracting a substantial and increasing share of users and users' online time, and may continue to attract an increasing share of online advertising dollars.\nIn addition, several competitors offer products and services that directly compete for users with our Digital Media segment offerings. Similarly, the advertising networks operated by our competitors or by other participants in the display marketplace offer services that directly compete with our offerings for advertisers, including advertising exchanges, ad networks, demand side platforms, ad serving technologies and sponsored search offerings. We also compete with traditional print and broadcast media companies to attract advertising spending. Some of our existing competitors and possible entrants may have greater brand recognition for certain products and services, more expertise in a particular segment of the market, and greater operational, strategic, technological, financial, personnel, or other resources than we do. Many of our competitors have access to considerable financial and technical resources with which to compete aggressively, including by funding future growth and expansion and investing in acquisitions, technologies, and research and development. Further, emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide new products and services faster than we can. In addition, competitors may consolidate with each other or collaborate, and new competitors may enter the market. Some of the competitors for our Business Cloud Services segment in international markets have a substantial competitive advantage over us because they have dominant market share in their territories, are owned by local telecommunications providers, have greater brand recognition, are focused on a single market, are more familiar with local tastes and preferences, or have greater regulatory and operational flexibility due to the fact that we may be subject to both U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements.\nIf our competitors are more successful than we are in developing and deploying compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, developers, or distributors, our revenue and growth rates could decline.\nOur growth will depend on our ability to develop, strengthen, and protect our brands, and these efforts may be costly and have varying degrees of success.\nOur brand recognition has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Strengthening our current brands and launching competitive new brands will be critical to achieving widespread commercial acceptance of our products and services. This will require our continued focus on active marketing, the costs of which have been increasing and may continue to increase. In addition, substantial initial investments may be required to launch new brands and expand existing brands to cover new geographic territories and technology fields. Accordingly, we may need to spend increasing amounts of money on, and devote greater resources to, advertising, marketing and other efforts to cultivate brand recognition and customer loyalty. In addition, we are supporting an increasing number of brands, each of which requires its own investment of resources. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues and, even if they do, increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred. If we fail to launch, promote, and maintain our brands, or if we incur substantial expenses in doing so, our business could be harmed.\nOur brand recognition depends, in part, on our ability to protect our trademark portfolio and establish trademark rights covering new brands and territories. Some regulators and competitors have taken the view that certain of our brands, such as eFax and eVoice, are descriptive or generic when applied to the products and services offered by our Business Cloud Services segment. Nevertheless, we have obtained U.S. and foreign trademark registrations for our brand names, logos, and other brand identifiers, including, eFax and eVoice. If we are unable to obtain, maintain or protect trademark rights covering our brands across the territories in which they are or may be offered, the value of these brands may be diminished, competitors may be able to dilute, harm, or freeload off our brand recognition and reputation, and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected.\nWe hold domain names relating to our brands, in the U.S. and internationally. The acquisition and maintenance of domain names are generally regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. The regulation of domain names may change. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to acquire or maintain all relevant domain names that relate to our brands. Furthermore, international rules governing the acquisition and maintenance of domain names in foreign jurisdictions are sometimes different from U.S. rules, and we may not be able to obtain all of our domains internationally. As a result of these factors, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our brands, trademarks or other proprietary rights. In addition, failure to secure or maintain domain names relevant to our brands could adversely affect our reputation and make it more difficult for users to find our websites and services.\nInadequate intellectual property protections could prevent us from defending our proprietary technology and intellectual property.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, contractual restrictions, and other confidentiality safeguards to protect our proprietary technology. However, these measures may provide only limited protection and it may be costly and time-consuming to enforce compliance with our intellectual property rights. In some circumstances, we may not have adequate, economically feasible or realistic options for enforcing our intellectual property and we may be unable to detect unauthorized use. While we have a robust worldwide portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications, there can be no assurance that any of these patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that we will be able to successfully police infringement, or that any rights granted under these patents will in fact provide a competitive advantage to us.\nIn addition, our ability to register or protect our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property may be limited in some foreign countries. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors in these regions from utilizing our intellectual property, which could reduce our competitive advantage and ability to compete in those regions and negatively impact our business.\nWe also strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We typically enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However, we may not be successful in executing these agreements with every party who has access to our confidential information or contributes to the development of our technology or intellectual property rights. Those agreements that we do execute may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. These contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not prevent the misappropriation or disclosure of our proprietary information nor deter independent development of similar technology or intellectual property by others.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of the content on our websites and mobile applications, and our other intellectual property and technology, is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property may not have been and may not be adequate to prevent their misappropriation or misuse. Third parties from time to time copy content or other intellectual property or technology from our solutions without authorization and seek to use it for their own benefit. We generally seek to address such unauthorized copying or use, but we have not always been successful in stopping all unauthorized use of our content or other intellectual property or technology, and may not be successful in doing so in the future. Further, we may not have been and may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our technology or intellectual property, or to take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nCompanies that operate in the same industry as our Business Cloud Services and Digital Media segments have experienced substantial litigation regarding intellectual property. Currently, we have pending patent infringement lawsuits, both offensive and defensive, against several companies in this industry. Furthermore, we may find it necessary or appropriate to initiate claims or litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of intellectual property rights claimed by\nothers. This or any other litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights may be expensive and time-consuming, could divert management resources and may not be adequate to protect our business.\nWe may be found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our operations.\nWe have been and expect to continue to be subject to legal claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. The ready availability of damages and royalties and the potential for injunctive relief have increased the costs associated with litigating and settling patent infringement claims. In addition, we may be required to indemnify our resellers and users for similar claims made against them. Any claims, whether or not meritorious, could require us to spend significant time, money, and other resources in litigation, pay damages and royalties, develop new intellectual property, modify, design around, or discontinue existing products, services, or features, or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claims. These licenses, if required, may not be available at all or have acceptable terms. As a result, intellectual property claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to risks from international operations.\nAs we continue to expand our business operations in countries outside the U.S., our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including, among others, foreign currency exchange rates; political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region; trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to provide our services; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries and affiliates. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our future business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe have only limited experience in marketing and operating our services in certain international markets. Moreover, we have in some cases experienced and expect to continue to experience in some cases higher costs as a percentage of revenues in connection with establishing and providing services in international markets versus the U.S. In addition, certain international markets may be slower than the U.S. in adopting the Internet and/or outsourced messaging and communications solutions and so our operations in international markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investments.\nAs we continue to grow our international operations, adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could have a material adverse effect on our balance sheet and results of operations.\nAs we expand our international operations, we could be exposed to significant risks of currency fluctuations. In some countries outside the U.S., we offer our services in the applicable local currency, including but not limited to the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, the Hong Kong Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the New Zealand Dollar, the Norwegian Kroner and the British Pound Sterling, among others. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations, which in turn may materially adversely affect reported earnings and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell our services in the same market. In addition, changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit our conversion of other currencies into U.S. Dollars. We cannot assure you that future exchange rate movements will not have a material adverse effect on our future business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.\nWe may be engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could divert significant operational resources and our management's time and attention.\nFrom time to time we are subject to litigation or claims or be involved in other legal disputes or regulatory inquiries, including in the areas of patent infringement and anti-trust, that could negatively affect our business operations and financial condition. Such disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, divert operational resources, occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention and negatively affect our business operations and financial condition. The outcomes of such matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, carrying the potential for unfavorable rulings that could include monetary damages and injunctive relief. We do not always have insurance coverage for defense costs, judgments, and settlements. We may also be subject to indemnification requirements with business partners, vendors, current and former officers and directors, and other third parties. Payments under such indemnification provisions may be material. For a more detailed description of certain lawsuits in which we are involved, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the supply of critical business elements and marketing relationships from other companies.\nWe depend upon third parties for critical elements of our business, including technology, infrastructure, customer service and sales and marketing components. We rely on private third-party providers for our Internet, telecommunications, website traffic and other connections and for co-location of a significant portion of our servers. Any disruption in the services provided by any of these suppliers, any adverse change in their terms and conditions of use or services, or any failure by them to handle current or higher volumes of activity could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. To obtain new cloud services customers, we have marketing agreements with operators of leading search engines and websites and employ the use of resellers to sell our products. These arrangements typically are not exclusive and do not extend over a significant period of time. Failure to continue these relationships on terms that are acceptable to us or to continue to create additional relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur business is highly dependent on our billing systems.\nA significant part of our revenues depends on prompt and accurate billing processes. Customer billing is a highly complex process, and our billing systems must efficiently interface with third-party systems, such as those of credit card processing companies. Our ability to accurately and efficiently bill our customers is dependent on the successful operation of our billing systems and the third-party systems upon which we rely, such as our credit card processor, and our ability to provide these third parties the information required to process transactions. In addition, our ability to offer new services or alternative-billing plans is dependent on our ability to customize our billing systems. Any failures or errors in our billing systems or procedures could impair our ability to properly bill our current customers or attract and service new customers, and thereby could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur success depends on our retention of our executive officers, senior management and our ability to hire and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience and performance of executive officers, senior management and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers, senior managers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, integrate and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for these people is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key employees or that we can attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel in the future.\nWe are exposed to risk if we cannot maintain or adhere to our internal controls and procedures.\nWe have established and continue to maintain, assess and update our internal controls and procedures regarding our business operations and financial reporting. Our internal controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding our business operations and financial reporting. However, because of the inherent limitations in this process, internal controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or misstatements. To the extent our internal controls are inadequate or not adhered to by our employees, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to maintain internal controls and procedures in a timely manner, or without adequate compliance, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities such as the SEC or NASDAQ. Any such action or restatement of prior-period financial results as a result could harm our business or investors' confidence in j2 Global, and could cause our stock price to fall.\nA substantial portion of our cash and investments is invested outside of the U.S. We may be subject to incremental taxes upon repatriation of such funds to the U.S.\nA significant portion of our worldwide cash reserves are generated by, and therefore held in, foreign jurisdictions. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is needed by, our U.S. operations, we may incur significant taxes to repatriate there funds.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position.\nOur level of indebtedness could have significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including our current indebtedness and any other indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other elements of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and payment of dividends;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrequire us to repatriate cash for debt service from our foreign subsidiaries resulting in tax costs or require us to adopt other disadvantageous tax structures to accommodate debt service payments;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, the indenture governing the 8.0% Senior Notes due 2020 (the \"Senior Notes\") of our subsidiary, j2 Cloud Services, Inc. (\"j2 Cloud Services\"), and the agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness may, contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nTo service our debt and fund our other capital requirements, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash will depend on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other elements of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and payment of dividends, will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations. To some extent, this is subject to general and regional economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot ensure that we will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional indebtedness or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The indenture governing the Senior Notes restricts our ability to dispose of assets and may also restrict our ability to raise indebtedness or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes restrict the current and future operations of j2 Cloud Services and, indirectly, us, particularly the ability of j2 Cloud Services to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Notes contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on j2 Cloud Services and, indirectly, us and may limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or make acquisitions, or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. These include restrictions on j2 Cloud Service's ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nengage in sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock;\n\u2022\npurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; or\n\u2022\neffect a consolidation or merger.\nA breach of the covenants under the indenture governing the Senior Notes could result in an event of default. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event our lenders or the holders of our Senior Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness or our other indebtedness.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes or to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change or on a repurchase date or Senior Notes upon a change in control, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes or the Senior Notes.\nHolders of the 3.25% convertible senior notes due June 15, 2029 (the \"Convertible Notes\") will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes on each of June 15, 2021 and June 15, 2024 and upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes), in each case, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Holders of the Senior Notes also have the right to require our subsidiary, j2 Cloud Services, to repurchase the Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the indenture governing the Senior Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. It is our intention to satisfy our conversion obligation by paying and delivering a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, where cash will be used to settle each $1,000 of principal and the remainder, if any, will be settled via shares of our common stock. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Notes or Senior Notes surrendered therefor or Convertible Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or Senior Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes or Senior Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the Convertible Notes indenture would constitute a default under the Convertible Notes indenture. A default under either indenture or the fundamental change or change of control itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nOur interest deductions attributable to the Convertible Notes may be deferred, limited or eliminated under certain conditions.\nWe believe that the Convertible Notes are subject to the IRS contingent payment debt instrument regulations. This conclusion is subject to complex factual and legal uncertainty and is not binding on the IRS or the courts. If the IRS takes a contrary position and a court sustains the IRS\u2019 position, our tax deductions would be severely diminished with a resulting adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to service the Convertible Notes.\nRisks Related To Our Industries\nOur services may become subject to burdensome regulation, which could increase our costs or restrict our service offerings.\nWe believe that our cloud services are \u201cinformation services\u201d under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and related precedent, or, if not \u201cinformation services,\u201d that we are entitled to other exemptions, meaning that we are not currently subject to U.S. telecommunications services regulation at both the federal and state levels. In connection with our cloud services business, we utilize data transmissions over public telephone lines and other facilities provided by third-party carriers. These transmissions are subject to foreign and domestic laws and regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d), state public utility commissions and foreign governmental authorities. These regulations affect the availability of numbers, the prices we pay for transmission services, the administrative costs associated with providing our services, the competition we face from telecommunications service providers and other aspects of our market. However, as messaging and communications services converge and as the services we offer expand, we may become subject to FCC or other regulatory agency regulation. It is also possible that a federal or state regulatory agency could take the position that our offerings, or a subset of our offerings, are properly classified as telecommunications services or otherwise not entitled to certain exemptions upon which we currently rely. Such a finding could potentially subject us to fines, penalties or enforcement actions as well as liabilities for past regulatory fees and charges, retroactive contributions to various telecommunications-related funds, telecommunications-related taxes, penalties and interest. It is also possible that such a finding could subject us to additional regulatory obligations that could potentially require us either to modify our offerings in a costly manner, diminish our ability to retain customers, or discontinue certain offerings, in order to comply with certain regulations. Changes in the regulatory environment could decrease our revenues, increase our costs and restrict our service offerings. In many of our international locations, we are subject to regulation by the applicable governmental authority.\nIn the U.S., Congress, the FCC, and a number of states require regulated telecommunications carriers to contribute to federal and/or state Universal Service Funds (\u201cUSF\u201d). Generally, USF is used to subsidize the cost of providing service to low-income customers and those living in high cost or rural areas. Congress, the FCC and a number of states are reviewing the manner in which a provider's contribution obligation is calculated, as well as the types of entities subject to USF contribution obligations. If any of these reforms are adopted, they could cause us to alter or eliminate our non-paid services and to raise the price of our paid services, which could cause us to lose customers. Any of these results could lead to a decrease in our revenues and net income and could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cTCPA\u201d) and FCC rules implementing the TCPA, as amended by the Junk Fax Act, prohibit sending unsolicited facsimile advertisements to telephone fax machines. The FCC, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"), or both may initiate enforcement action against companies that send \u201cjunk faxes\u201d and individuals also may have a private cause of action. Although entities that merely transmit facsimile messages on behalf of others are not liable for compliance with the prohibition on faxing unsolicited advertisements, the exemption from liability does not apply to fax transmitters that have a high degree of involvement or actual notice of an illegal use and have failed to take steps to prevent such transmissions. We take significant steps to ensure that our services are not used to send unsolicited faxes on a large scale, and we do not believe that we have a high degree of involvement or notice of the use of our service to broadcast junk faxes. However, because fax transmitters do not enjoy an absolute exemption from liability under the TCPA and related FCC and FTC rules, we could face inquiries from the FCC and FTC or enforcement actions by these agencies, or private causes of action, if someone uses our service for such impermissible purposes. If this were to occur and we were to be held liable for someone's use of our service for transmitting unsolicited faxes, the financial penalties could cause a material adverse effect on our operations.\nAlso, in the U.S., the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act (\u201cCALEA\u201d) requires telecommunications carriers to be capable of performing wiretaps and recording other call identifying information. In September 2005, the FCC released an order defining telecommunications carriers that are subject to CALEA obligations as facilities-based broadband Internet access providers and Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) providers that interconnect with the public switched telephone network. As a result of this definition, we do not believe that j2 Global is subject to CALEA. However, if the category of service providers to which CALEA applies broadens to also include information services, that change may impact our operations.\nThe FCC has adopted rules requiring certain providers, like us, to enable text-to-911 messages from our platform. We are in the process of implementing this solution. Emergency call centers will have the ability to request that we activate this functionality when such centers are capable of receiving these communications. We may be subject to fines, penalties or enforcement actions, at both the federal and state levels, if our service is found to be out of compliance or we may decide to discontinue the service offering. Additionally, providing such functionality may increase our costs of providing our text messaging service which may reduce our profits, or make our offering less competitive in the marketplace if we increase the price to subscribers and lead to less revenue if we lose subscribers due to price increases. We cannot predict the impact of these text-to-911 rules on our text messaging offering at this time.\nWe are subject to a variety of new and existing laws and regulations which could subject us to claims, judgments, monetary liabilities and other remedies, and to limitations on our business practices.\nThe application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations to us relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection, security, defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, promotions, billing, consumer protection, accessibility, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement in many instances is unclear or unsettled. In addition, we will also be subject to any new laws and regulations directly applicable to our domestic and international activities. Further, the application of existing laws to us or our subsidiaries regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers including, for example, distribution of pharmaceuticals, alcohol, adult content, tobacco, or firearms, as well as insurance and securities brokerage, and legal services, can be unclear. Internationally, we may also be subject to laws regulating our activities in foreign countries and to foreign laws and regulations that are inconsistent from country to country. Our Digital Media segment utilizes contractors, freelancers and staff from third party outsourcers to provide content and other services. However, in the future, arrangements with such individuals may not be deemed appropriate by the relevant government authority, which could result in additional costs and expenses. We may incur substantial liabilities for expenses necessary to defend such litigation or to comply with these laws and regulations, as well as potential substantial penalties for any failure to comply. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also cause us to change or limit our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nThe use of consumer data by online service providers and advertising networks is a topic of active interest among federal, state, and international regulatory bodies, and the regulatory environment is unsettled and evolving. Federal, state, and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, disclosure, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. Our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of user data are posted on our websites.\nA number of U.S. federal laws, including those referenced below, impact our business. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) is intended, in part, to limit the liability of eligible online service providers for listing or linking to third-party Websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. Portions of the Communications Decency Act (\u201cCDA\u201d) are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third-party content. We rely on the protections provided by both the DMCA and the CDA in conducting our business. If these or other laws or judicial interpretations are changed to narrow their protections, or if international jurisdictions refuse to apply similar provisions in foreign lawsuits, we will be subject to greater risk of liability, our costs of compliance with these regulations or to defend litigation may increase, or our ability to operate certain lines of business may be limited. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act is intended to impose restrictions on the ability of online services to collect some types of information from children under the age of 13. In addition, Providing Resources, Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our Children Act of 2008 (\u201cPROTECT Act\u201d) requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances. Other federal, state or international laws and legislative efforts designed to protect children on the Internet may impose additional requirements on us. U.S. export control laws and regulations impose requirements and restrictions on exports to certain nations and persons and on our business.\nIn certain instances, we may be subject to enhanced privacy obligations based on the type of information we store and process. For example, the Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act requires certain entities to comply with data privacy and security regulations when providing services to certain entities that collect particular kinds of information. While we believe we are in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, forfeitures and other adverse actions.\nThe Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (the \u201cCAN-SPAM Act\u201d), which allows for penalties that run into the millions of dollars, requires commercial emails to include identifying information from the sender and a mechanism for the receiver to opt out of receiving future emails. Several states have enacted additional, more restrictive and punitive laws regulating commercial email. Foreign legislation exists as well, including Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Legislation (\u201cCASL\u201d) and the European laws that have been enacted pursuant to European Union Directive 2002/58/EC and its amendments. We believe that our email practices comply with the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act, state laws, and applicable foreign\nlegislation. If we were ever found to be in violation of these laws and regulations, or any other laws or regulations, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nMany third parties are examining whether the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) concept of public accommodations also extends to the Internet as well. The Company is assessing the requirements of the ADA to determine what impact this could have on our websites. If the Internet is found to be a place of public accommodation and the ADA is found to apply, then any adjustments or requirements to implement any changes prescribed by the ADA could result in increased costs to our business.\nNative advertising is an increasing part of our Digital Media segment\u2019s online advertising revenue. On December 22, 2015 the FTC issued Guidelines and an Enforcement Policy Statement on native advertising, described by the FTC as, in part, ads which often \u2018resemble the design, style, and functionality of the media in which they are disseminated\u2019. The Company, as well as trade groups and our consultants, are assessing the requirements of these guidelines on our current practices and industry practices and what, if any, effect this could have on our native advertising business. In addition, the timing and extent of any enforcement by the FTC with regard to the native advertising practices by the Company, or others, could reduce the revenue we generate from this line of business.\nFor certain data transfers between the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and the U.S., j2, like many other companies, relies on what is referred to as the \u201cEU-U.S. Safe Harbor,\u201d in order to comply with privacy obligations imposed by EU countries. Recently, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor. Subsequently, a group comprised of the majority of EU data protection regulators issued a statement that it would further consider the decision issued by the European Court of Justice and coordinate any potential enforcement actions after January 31, 2016. But some individual data protection regulators located in EU countries have threatened to begin enforcement actions independently of this larger representative group of such entities. Meantime, U.S. and EU policymakers continue efforts to create a different framework that would allow companies like us to continue to rely on some form of a safe harbor for the transfer of certain data from the EU to the U.S. Additionally, other countries that relied on the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor that were not part of the EU have also found that data transfers to the U.S. are no longer valid based on the European Court of Justice ruling. We cannot predict how or if this issue will be resolved nor can we evaluate any potential liability at this time.\nThe Company is working to put into place various alternative grounds on which to rely in order to be in compliance with relevant law for the transfer of data from overseas locations to the U.S. which have not been invalidated by the European Court of Justice. Some independent data regulators have adopted the position that other forms of compliance are also invalid though the legal grounds for these findings remain unclear at this time. We cannot predict at this time whether the alternative grounds that j2 continues to implement will be found to be consistent with relevant laws nor what any potential liability may be at this time.\nFurther, failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies, applicable requirements, or industry self-regulatory principles related to the collection, use, sharing or security of personal information, or other privacy, data-retention or data-protection matters could result in a loss of user confidence in us, damage to our brands, and ultimately in a loss of users and advertising partners, which could adversely affect our business. Changes in these or any other laws and regulations or the interpretation of them could increase our future compliance costs, make our products and services less attractive to our users, or cause us to change or limit our business practices. Further, any failure on our part to comply with any relevant laws or regulations may subject us to significant civil or criminal liabilities.\nGovernment and private actions or self-regulatory developments regarding Internet privacy matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nOur Digital Media business collects and sells data about its users\u2019 online behavior and the revenue associated with this activity could be impacted by government regulation and enforcement, industry trends, self-regulation, technology changes, consumer behavior and attitude, and private action. We also use such information to work with our advertisers to more effectively target ads to relevant users and consumers, which ads command a higher rate.\nThe use of such consumer data by online service providers and advertising networks is a topic of active interest among federal, state, and international regulatory bodies, and the regulatory environment is unsettled. Federal, state, and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, disclosure, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. Our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of user data are posted on our websites.\nNew and expanding \"Do Not Track\" regulations have recently been enacted or proposed that protect users' right to choose whether or not to be tracked online. These regulations seek, among other things, to allow consumers to have greater control over the use of private information collected online, to forbid the collection or use of online information, to demand a business to comply with their choice to opt out of such collection or use, and to place limits upon the disclosure of information to third party websites. These laws and regulations could have a significant impact on the operation of our advertising and data businesses. U.S. regulatory agencies have also placed an increased focus on online privacy matters and, in particular, on online advertising activities that utilizes cookies or other tracking tools. Consumer and industry groups have expressed concerns about online data collection and use by companies, which has resulted in the release of various industry self-regulatory codes of conduct and best practice guidelines that are binding for member companies and that govern, among other things, the ways in which companies can collect, use and disclose user information, how companies must give notice of these practices and what choices companies must provide to consumers regarding these practices.\nWe may be required or otherwise choose to adopt Do Not Track mechanisms or self-regulation principles, in which case our ability to use our existing tracking technologies, to collect and sell user behavioral data, and permit their use by other third parties could be impaired. This could cause our net revenues to decline and adversely affect our operating results.\nU.S. and foreign governments have enacted or considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict our ability to collect, augment, analyze, use and share anonymous data, which could increase our costs and reduce our revenue.\nThe EU has traditionally imposed more strict obligations under data privacy laws and regulations. Individual EU member countries have had discretion with respect to their interpretation and implementation of EU data privacy laws, resulting in variation of privacy standards from country to country. Additionally, in December 2015, the European Commission announced significant reforms to its existing data protection legal framework that may result in a greater compliance burden with respect to our operations and data use in Europe.\nOur business could suffer if providers of broadband Internet access services block, impair or degrade our services.\nOur business is dependent on the ability of our cloud services customers and visitors to our digital media properties to access our services and applications over broadband Internet connections. In March, 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet connections as Title II common carriers services and imposed network neutrality rules that would prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that traverse their networks. Certain parties have appealed the FCC\u2019s rules but most of the FCC rules are currently effective. While we have not encountered any material difficulties with regard to such access, increased network congestion in the future may result in broadband Internet access providers engaging in actions that would either reduce the quality of the services we provide today, or impede our ability to offer new services that use more bandwidth. The FCC\u2019s network neutrality rules would ensure that cloud service providers, like us, would not be disparately impacted by network operators. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending appeal of the FCC\u2019s network neutrality rules.\nCongress could enact laws that are not as strong as the FCC\u2019s and limit the FCC\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to broadband service providers. To the extent network operators attempt to extract fees from us to deliver our traffic or otherwise engage in discriminatory practices, our business could be adversely impacted. We cannot forecast congressional action. As we continue to expand internationally, government regulation concerning the Internet, and in particular, network neutrality, may be nascent or non-existent. Within such a regulatory environment, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\nOur cloud services business is dependent on a small number of telecommunications carriers in each region and our inability to maintain agreements at attractive rates with such carriers may negatively impact our business.\nOur cloud services business substantially depends on the capacity, affordability, reliability and security of our network and services provided to us by our telecommunications suppliers. Only a small number of carriers in each region, and in some cases only one carrier, offer the number and network services we require. We purchase certain telecommunications services pursuant to short-term agreements that the providers can terminate or elect not to renew. As a result, any or all of our current carriers could discontinue providing us with service at rates acceptable to us, or at all, and we may not be able to obtain adequate replacements, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer if we cannot obtain or retain numbers, are prohibited from obtaining local numbers or are limited to distributing local numbers to only certain customers.\nThe future success of our number-based cloud services business depends on our ability to procure large quantities of local numbers in the U.S. and foreign countries in desirable locations at a reasonable cost and offer our services to our prospective customers without restrictions. Our ability to procure and distribute numbers depends on factors such as applicable regulations, the practices of telecommunications carriers that provide numbers, the cost of these numbers and the level of demand for new numbers. For example, several years ago the FCC conditionally granted petitions by Connecticut and California to adopt specialized \u201cunified messaging\u201d area codes, but neither state has adopted such a code. Adoption of a specialized area code within a state or nation could harm our ability to complete in that state or nation if materially affecting our ability to acquire numbers for our operations or making our services less attractive due to the unavailability of numbers with a local geographic area.\nIn addition, although we are the customer of record for all of our U.S. numbers, from time to time, certain U.S. telephone carriers inhibit our ability to port numbers or port our numbers away from us to other carriers. If a federal or regulatory agency determines that our customers should have the ability to port numbers without our consent, we may lose customers at a faster rate than what we have experienced historically, potentially resulting in lower revenues. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, under certain circumstances, our customers are permitted to port their numbers to another carrier. These factors could lead to increased cancellations by our cloud services customers and loss of our number inventory. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and growth in or entry into foreign or domestic markets.\nIn addition, future growth in our number-based cloud services subscriber base, together with growth in the subscriber bases of other providers of number-based services, has increased and may continue to increase the demand for large quantities of numbers, which could lead to insufficient capacity and our inability to acquire sufficient numbers to accommodate our future growth.\nWe may be subject to increased rates for the telecommunications services we purchase from regulated carriers which could require us to either raise the retail prices of our offerings and lose customers or reduce our profit margins.\nThe FCC recently adopted wide-ranging reforms to the system under which regulated providers of telecommunications services compensate each other for the exchange of various kinds of traffic. While we are not a provider of regulated telecommunications services, we rely on such providers to offer our cloud services to our customers. As a result of the FCC's reforms, regulated providers of telecommunications services are determining how the rates they charge customers like us will change in order to comply with the new rules. It is possible that some or all of our underlying carriers will increase the rates we pay for certain telecommunications services. Should this occur, the costs we incur to provide number-based cloud services may increase which may require us to increase the retail price of our services. Increased prices could, in turn, cause us to lose customers, or, if we do not pass on such higher costs to our subscribers, our profit margins may decrease.\nNew technologies have been developed that are able to block certain of our advertisements or impair our ability to serve interest-based advertising which could harm our operating results.\nTechnologies have been developed and are likely to continue to be developed that can block Internet or mobile display advertising. Most of our Digital Media segment revenues are derived from fees paid by advertisers in connection with the display of advertisements or clicks on advertisements on web pages or mobile devices. As a result, such technologies and tools are reducing the number of display advertisements that we are able to deliver or our ability to serve our interest-based advertising and this, in turn, could reduce our advertising revenue and operating results. Adoption of these types of technologies by more of our users could have a material impact on our revenues. We have implemented third party products to combat these ad-blocking technologies and are developing other strategies to address advertisement blocking. However, our efforts may not be successful to offset the potential increasing impact of these advertising blocking products.\nIf we or our third-party service providers fail to prevent click fraud or choose to manage traffic quality in a way that advertisers find unsatisfactory, our profitability may decline.\nA portion of our display revenue comes from advertisers that pay for advertising on a price-per-click basis, meaning that the advertisers pay a fee every time a user clicks on their advertising. This pricing model can be vulnerable to so-called \u201cclick fraud,\u201d which occurs when clicks are submitted on ads by a user who is motivated by reasons other than genuine interest in the subject of the ad. We or our third-party service providers may be exposed to the risk of click fraud or other clicks or conversions that advertisers may perceive as undesirable. If fraudulent or other malicious activity is perpetrated by others and we or our third-\nparty service providers are unable to detect and prevent it, or choose to manage traffic quality in a way that advertisers find unsatisfactory, the affected advertisers may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investment in our advertising programs which could lead the advertisers to become dissatisfied with our advertising programs and they might refuse to pay, demand refunds, or withdraw future business. Undetected click fraud could damage our brands and lead to a loss of advertisers and revenue.\nIf we are unable to continue to attract visitors to our websites from search engines, then consumer traffic to our websites could decrease, which could negatively impact the sales of our products and services, our advertising revenue and the number of purchases generated for our retailers through our Digital Media marketplace.\nWe generate consumer traffic to our websites using various methods, including search engine marketing, or SEM, search engine optimization, or SEO, email campaigns and social media referrals. Our net revenues and profitability levels are dependent upon our continued ability to use a combination of these methods to generate consumer traffic to our websites in a cost-efficient manner. We have experienced and continue to experience fluctuations in search result rankings for a number of our websites. There can be no assurances that we will be able to grow or maintain current levels of consumer traffic.\nOur SEM and SEO techniques have been developed to work with existing search algorithms utilized by the major search engines. Major search engines frequently modify their search algorithms. Changes in these algorithms could cause our websites to receive less favorable placements, which could reduce the number of users who visit our websites. In addition, we use keyword advertising to improve our search ranking and to attract users to our sites. If we fail to follow legal requirements regarding the use of keywords or search engine guidelines and policies properly, search engines may rank our content lower in search results or could remove our content altogether from their indices.\nAny decline in consumer traffic to our websites could adversely impact the amount of ads that are displayed and the number of purchases we generate for our retailers, which could adversely affect our net revenues. An attempt to replace this traffic through other channels may require us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures, which would adversely affect our operating results and which may not be offset by additional net revenues.\nThe industries in which we operate are undergoing rapid technological changes and we may not be able to keep up.\nThe industries in which we operate are subject to rapid and significant technological change. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. We expect that new services and technologies will emerge in the markets in which we compete. These new services and technologies may be superior to the services and technologies that we use or these new services may render our services and technologies obsolete. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. We may be unable to obtain access to new technologies on acceptable terms or at all, and may therefore be unable to offer services in a competitive manner. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIncreased cost of email transmissions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on email for the delivery of certain cloud services. We also offer email security, encryption and archival services. If regulations or other changes in the industry lead to a charge associated with the sending or receiving of email messages, the cost of providing our services could increase and, if significant, could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nRisks Related To Our Stock\nThe fundamental change purchase feature of the Convertible Notes and the change of control features of the Senior Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.\nThe terms of the Convertible Notes require us to offer to purchase the Convertible Notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes), and the terms of the Senior Notes require our subsidiary, j2 Cloud Services, to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes for cash in the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the Senior Notes). These features may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nConversions of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Convertible Notes.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could depress the price of our common stock.\nWe are a holding company and our operations are conducted through, and substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by, our subsidiaries, which are subject to certain restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us to fund dividends on our stock, pay interest on the Convertible Notes and fund other holding company expenses.\nWe are a holding company. We conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. A substantial portion of our consolidated assets is held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends on our stock, service our debt, including the Convertible Notes, and fund other holding company expenses depends on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of such subsidiaries to provide us with cash, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise.\nIn addition, dividends, loans or other distributions to us from such subsidiaries are subject to contractual and other restrictions and are subject to other business considerations. j2 Cloud Services, which currently conducts all of our operations, is subject to restrictions on dividends in its existing indenture with respect to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes indenture generally prohibits dividends except out of a basket of 50% of cumulative net income (as defined in the indenture) and proceeds from equity offerings, although it permits any dividends if j2 Cloud Services\u2019 pro forma leverage ratio (as calculated as required by the indenture) is less than 1.75 to 1. While j2 Cloud Services is currently in compliance with such covenants, its ability to comply with such covenants is subject to conditions outside its control. If we cannot obtain cash from our subsidiaries, we may not be able to pay dividends on our stock, pay interest on the Convertible Notes and fund other operating company expenses without additional sources of cash.\nQuarterly dividends may not continue, may not continue to grow or could decrease.\nWe may not continue to issue quarterly dividends or we could decrease the amount of any future dividends or cease to increase the amount of any future dividends. We paid our first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock on September 19, 2011. We have declared increasing dividends in each subsequent quarter. Future dividends are subject to Board approval. We cannot assure that the Company will continue to pay a dividend in the future or the amount of any future dividends.\nFuture sales of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.\nAs of February 23, 2016, substantially all of our outstanding shares of common stock were available for resale, subject to volume and manner of sale limitations applicable to affiliates under SEC Rule 144. Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market or the perception of such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a price that we think is appropriate, or at all.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us. For example, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire us without the approval of our Board of Directors. Additionally, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without requiring any stockholder approval, and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline.\nOur stock price and trading volumes have been volatile and we expect that this volatility will continue in the future due to factors, such as:\n\u2022\nAssessments of the size of our subscriber base and our average revenue per subscriber, and comparisons of our results in these and other areas versus prior performance and that of our competitors;\n\u2022\nVariations between our actual results and investor expectations;\n\u2022\nRegulatory or competitive developments affecting our markets;\n\u2022\nInvestor perceptions of us and comparable public companies;\n\u2022\nConditions and trends in the communications, messaging and Internet-related industries;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of technological innovations and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nIntroduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nDevelopments with respect to intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nConditions and trends in the Internet and other technology industries;\n\u2022\nRumors, gossip or speculation published on public chat or bulletin boards;\n\u2022\nGeneral market conditions; and\n\u2022\nGeopolitical events such as war, threat of war or terrorist actions.\nIn addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stocks of technology and other companies, particularly communications and Internet companies. These broad market fluctuations have previously resulted in a material decline in the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation is often expensive and diverts management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 87075, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "JCOM"}
