{"cik": "102741", "company": "VALSPAR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information presented or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating our business and any investment in us.\nThe proposed Merger may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all, and the failure to complete or delays in completing the Merger could adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nWe can provide no assurance that the Merger will be consummated or consummated in the timeframe or manner currently anticipated. The Merger is subject to a number of conditions including the receipt of regulatory approvals, which are not within our control. There can be no assurance as to when, or if, the conditions to closing of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the termination of the Merger.\nAny delay in closing or a failure to close could have a negative impact on our business, financial results and stock price as well as our relationships with our customers, suppliers or employees, and a negative impact on our ability to pursue alternative strategic transactions and/or our ability to implement alternative business plans. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $300 million.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely impacted during the pendency of the Merger.\nThe Merger may cause disruptions to our business or business relationships and create uncertainty surrounding our ongoing business operations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, regardless of whether the Merger is completed, including as a result of the following (all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Merger):\n\u2022\ncustomers, suppliers or other parties with which we maintain business relationships may experience uncertainty prior to the closing of the Merger and seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to terminate or re-negotiate their relationships with us;\n\u2022\nour employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate key personnel and other employees;\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement restricts us from engaging in certain actions without the consent of Sherwin-Williams, which could prevent us from pursuing opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Merger; and\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management may be directed to transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day operations of our business.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether or not the Merger is consummated.\nRegulatory authorities may require divestitures in connection with the proposed Merger, which could result in Valspar stockholders receiving $105 per share instead of $113 per share as consideration in connection with completion of the Merger.\nFollowing completion of the Merger, Valspar stockholders will receive as merger consideration $113 per share in cash, except that the merger consideration will be $105 per share in cash if Sherwin-Williams is required, in order to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, to commit to any divestiture, license, hold separate, sale or other disposition of or with respect to assets, businesses or product lines of Valspar, Sherwin-Williams or their subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, in excess of $650 million of net sales (as defined in the Merger Agreement). There can be no assurance as to whether regulatory authorities will not require such divestitures and accordingly there can be no assurance that Valspar stockholders will receive $113 per share in cash instead of $105 per share in cash.\nDeterioration of economic conditions could harm our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, access to and the functioning of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Deterioration of national or global economic conditions may reduce demand for our products and overall growth of the paints and coatings industry.\nVolatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national or global economic conditions could impact our operations as follows:\n\u2022\nthe financial stability of our customers and suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for us or non-performance by suppliers;\n\u2022\nit may become more costly or difficult to obtain financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to refinance our debt in the future; and\n\u2022\nthe value of our investments in debt and equity securities may decline, including our assets held in pension plans.\nAt various times, we utilize hedges and other derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various interest rate risks, which qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes. Volatile fluctuations in market conditions could cause these instruments to become ineffective, which could require any gains or losses associated with these instruments to be reported in our earnings each period.\nWe have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may not be recoverable. Impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash flows that may result in us incurring substantial impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nFluctuations in the availability and prices of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe purchase the raw materials needed to manufacture our products from a number of suppliers. Most of our raw materials are derived from petroleum, minerals and metals. Under normal market conditions, these materials are generally available from one or more suppliers on the open market. From time to time, however, the availability and costs of raw materials may fluctuate significantly, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing our products. As a result, our raw material costs can be volatile, and we have experienced disruptions in supplies of certain raw materials at various times. These disruptions could affect our ability to manufacture products ordered by our customers, which could negatively impact sales.\nWhen raw material costs increase, our profit margins are reduced unless and until we are able to pass along the increases to our customers through higher prices. If raw material costs increase and if we are unable to pass along, or are delayed in passing along, those increases to our customers, we will experience profit margin reductions.\nMany of our customers are in cyclical industries, which may affect the demand for our products.\nMany of our customers are in businesses or industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. As a result, the demand for our products depends, in part, upon economic cycles affecting our customers' businesses or industries and general economic conditions. Downward economic cycles affecting the industries of our customers and the deterioration of global economic conditions may reduce our sales and profitability.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources than we do.\nAll aspects of the paints and coatings business are highly competitive. We face strong competitors in all areas of our business. Any increase in competition may cause us to lose market share or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. Competitive pressures may not only impair our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources than we do. Competition with these companies could curtail price increases or require price reductions or increased spending on marketing, sales and research and development, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur larger competitors may have more resources to finance acquisitions or internal growth in this competitive environment, and may have more resources or capabilities to conduct business with large suppliers or large customers in our industry. Finally, many of our larger competitors operate businesses in addition to paints and coatings and so may be better able to compete during coatings industry downturns.\nWe have a significant amount of debt.\nOur total long-term and short-term debt was $1,778.4 million at October 28, 2016. Our debt categorized as short-term was $221.4 million at October 28, 2016. Our level of debt may have important consequences. For example, it:\n\u2022\nmay require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\ncould make us less attractive to prospective or existing customers or less able to fund potential acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nmay limit our flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions as compared to a competitor that may have less indebtedness.\nGlobal economic and capital market conditions may cause our access to capital to be more difficult in the future and/or costs to secure such capital more expensive.\nWe may need new or additional financing in the future to provide liquidity to conduct our operations, expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness. Any sustained weakness in general economic conditions and/or U.S. or global capital markets could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all. From time to time we have relied, and we may also rely in the future, on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Longer term volatility and continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation of financial institutions, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term. Such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.\nAcquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy, and future acquisitions may not be available or successful.\nAcquisitions have historically contributed significantly to the growth of our company. As part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and products. If we are not able to identify and complete future acquisitions, our growth may be negatively affected. Even if we are successful in completing future acquisitions, we may experience:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business;\n\u2022\ndelays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products;\n\u2022\ndifficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter;\n\u2022\nunforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability;\n\u2022\nunforeseen adjustments, charges and write-offs;\n\u2022\nunexpected losses of customers of, or suppliers to, acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in conforming the acquired business\u2019 standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n\u2022\nvariability in financial information arising from the application of purchase price accounting;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nchallenges arising from the increased geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.\nAny of these factors may make it more difficult to repay our debt or have an adverse effect on results of operations. In addition, an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize acquisition-related costs or the cost of acquired assets.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from foreign markets, which subjects us to additional business risks.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the U.S. We currently have production facilities, research and development facilities and administrative and sales offices located outside the U.S., including facilities and offices located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. In 2016, revenues from products sold outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 45% of our consolidated net sales. Accordingly, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe expect sales in international markets to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net sales. Notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in international operations include the following:\n\u2022\nagreements may be difficult to enforce, and receivables may be difficult to collect or have longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\nforeign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nforeign operations may experience labor disputes and difficulties in attracting and retaining key employees;\n\u2022\ntransportation and other shipping costs may increase;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may nationalize private enterprises;\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes may occur in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses;\n\u2022\nintellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce;\n\u2022\nour business and profitability in a particular country could be affected by political or economic changes or terrorist activities and responses to such activities;\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may be burdensome.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.\nWe conduct business in various regions throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the exchange rate of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. The functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally the local currency in the corresponding country. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. We have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to translation gains and losses. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, could materially affect our financial results. At October 28, 2016, the regions where we have the largest exposure to our net sales, net income and financial position were China (CNY), Europe (EUR), Mexico (MXN), the UK (GBP), Australia (AUD), Brazil (BRL) and Canada (CAD).\nWe have certain key customers, and the loss of key customers could negatively affect our business.\nOur relationships with certain key customers are important to us. From 2014 through 2016, sales to our largest customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated net sales. In 2016, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 31% of our consolidated net sales. Our five largest customers in the Paints segment accounted for approximately 47% of our net sales in the segment. Our five largest customers in the Coatings segment accounted for approximately 19% of our net sales in the segment. Although we sell various types of products through various channels of distribution, we believe that the loss of a substantial portion of net sales to our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have not typically entered into long-term contracts with our major customers for minimum purchase requirements. If any one of our key customers cease making purchases at historical levels, with little or no notice, we could experience a material adverse effect.\nOur ability to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet the demands of our customers could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, volume demands, performance and price expectations of our customers. Future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that adapt to our customers' specific preferences. If we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 or consumers\u2019 perceptions about the acceptability or potential environmental or health effects of certain substances could require us to invest additional amounts to develop products that exclude those substances. If we are unable to develop products that exclude those substances when and if required by our customers, we may experience reduced sales and profitability.\nSupply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. It is not always possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. However, such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers.\nIf the reputation of our company or one or more of its key brands is damaged, it could harm our business.\nOur reputation is one of the foundations of our relationships with key customers and other stakeholders. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues that negatively affect our reputation, our ability to conduct our business could be impaired, and our financial results could suffer. As we continue to invest in advertising and promotion for our key brands, our financial success is becoming more dependent on the success of our brands. The success of these brands could suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired effect on a brand\u2019s image, reputation or ability to attract customers. Further, our growth and results could be harmed if the reputation of our company or a key brand is damaged due to real or perceived quality issues, product recalls, regulatory enforcement or actions or customer claims and litigation.\nTechnology changes, and our ability to protect our technology, could affect our business.\nOur product and application technology is supported by underlying chemistry that has been developed over many years. Ongoing research and development efforts focus on improving our internally developed and acquired technology and formulating changes to improve the performance, profitability and cost competitiveness of our products. If our competitors develop new technology, or if our customers\u2019 technology requirements change, and we are not able to develop competitive technology, our business and financial results could suffer. Further, although we seek to protect our proprietary technology and information through confidentiality and trade secret protection programs and practices, patents, cybersecurity measures and other means, if we were unable to protect our material proprietary technology or information, our business and financial results could suffer.\nInterruption, failure or compromise of our information systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information systems to run most aspects of our business, including sales and distribution of products, purchases of raw materials and supplies, accounting for purchase and sale transactions, manufacturing processes, billing and collections and managing data and records for employees and other parties. Our business may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted, damaged or compromised or if they fail for any extended period of time due to user errors, programming errors, computer viruses, security breaches or other problems. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of cyber attackers. Although we strive to have appropriate security controls in place, prevention of security breaches cannot be assured, particularly as cyber threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our security measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. In addition, third-party service providers manage a portion of our information systems, and we are subject to risk as a result of interruption, failure or security breaches of those systems. The consequences of these risks could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nNumerous laws and regulations affect our business, and new laws or regulations, adverse decisions relating to our compliance with existing laws and regulations, or changes to these laws and regulations, could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices. We are affected by new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and\nregulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. From time to time, our Company, our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. We are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance. In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities. In addition to existing examinations and investigations, there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future, and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations that control the manufacturing, marketing, sale, use and disposal of our products. These laws and regulations include health, safety, product liability, environmental and labeling requirements applicable to our products and business.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, or otherwise relating to environmental protection and various health and safety matters. These environmental laws and regulations impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. We are currently undertaking remedial activities at a number of our facilities and properties and have received notices under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, or analogous state laws, of liability or potential liability in connection with the disposal of material from our operations or former operations. Pursuant to health, safety, product liability and labeling laws and regulations, we have also been subject to various governmental enforcement actions and litigation by individuals relating to the sale or use of or exposure to our products or materials used or contained in our products, including claims for property damage or personal injury claimed to have been caused by our products or materials used or contained in our products.\nWe are subject to the risk that adverse decisions relating to our compliance with existing laws and regulations and new laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could limit our ability to generate revenues, increase our compliance costs and expand our potential liability for enforcement actions by governmental authorities and litigation by individuals.", "PERMNO": 37807, "SIC": 2851, "TIC": "VAL.1"}
