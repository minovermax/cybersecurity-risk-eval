{"cik": "1388430", "company": "CAI International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors may lose all or part of their investment. This section should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, and Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Risks\nContainer leasing demand can be negatively affected by numerous market factors as well as external political and economic events that are beyond our control. Decreasing leasing demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for containers depends largely on the rate of world trade and economic growth. Demand for leased containers is also driven by our customers\u2019 \u201clease vs. buy\u201d decisions. Cyclical recessions can negatively affect the operating results of container lessors, such as us, because during economic downturns or periods of reduced trade, shipping lines tend to lease fewer containers, or lease containers only at reduced rates, and tend to rely more on their own fleets to satisfy a greater percentage of their requirements. As a result, during periods of weak global economic activity, container lessors like ourselves typically experience decreased leasing demand, decreased equipment utilization, lower average rental rates, decreased leasing revenue, decreased used container resale prices and significantly decreased profitability. These effects can be severe.\nFor example, our key operating metrics and profitability in 2019 and the first half of 2020 were negatively impacted by reduced trade and economic growth, both of which were affected by increased trade tariffs due to trade dispute between the U.S. and China and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns. As a result, our utilization, average leasing rates and used container prices decreased steadily throughout 2019 and the first half of 2020, and our profitability decreased as well. We have also experienced a number of other periods of weak performance due to adverse global economic conditions, including in 2009 due to the global financial crisis, and during 2015 and 2016 due to a global manufacturing recession. During both of these periods, our profitability and growth rate were significantly impacted by weak container demand.\nOther general factors affecting demand for leased containers, container utilization and per diem rental rates include:\n\uf0b7available supply and prices of new and used containers;\n\uf0b7changes in the operating efficiency of our customers;\n\uf0b7economic conditions and competitive pressures in the shipping industry;\n\uf0b7shifting trends and patterns of cargo traffic, including a reduction in exports from Asian nations or increased trade imbalances;\n\uf0b7the availability and terms of container financing;\n\uf0b7fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values;\n\uf0b7overcapacity or undercapacity of the container manufacturers;\n\uf0b7the lead times required to purchase containers;\n\uf0b7the number of containers purchased by competitors and container lessees;\n\uf0b7container ship fleet overcapacity or undercapacity;\n\uf0b7increased repositioning by container shipping lines of their own empty containers to higher-demand locations in lieu of leasing containers from us;\n\uf0b7consolidation or withdrawal of individual container lessees in the container shipping industry;\n\uf0b7import/export tariffs and restrictions;\n\uf0b7customs procedures, foreign exchange controls and other governmental regulations;\n\uf0b7natural disasters that are severe enough to affect local and global economies, including pandemics such as COVID-19;\n\uf0b7political and economic factors, including any changes in international trade agreements; and\n\uf0b7future regulations which could restrict our current business practices and increase our cost of doing business.\n\u200e\nAll of these factors are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors will vary over time, often quickly and unpredictably, and any change in one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Many of these factors also influence decisions by our customers to lease or buy containers. Should one or more of these factors influence our customers to buy a larger percentage of the containers they operate, our utilization rate would decrease, resulting in decreased revenue and increased storage and repositioning costs.\nThe demand for leased containers is particularly tied to international trade. If international trade were to decrease, as a result of increased tariffs or other actions impeding trade, it could reduce demand for container leasing, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our containers are used in trade involving goods being shipped from exporting countries (e.g., China and other export-oriented Asian countries) to importing countries (e.g., other Asian countries, North America and Western Europe). The willingness and ability of international consumers to purchase foreign goods is dependent upon political support for an absence of government-imposed barriers to international trade in goods and services. For example, international consumer demand for foreign goods is related to price. Therefore, if the price differential between foreign goods and domestically-produced goods were to decrease due to increased tariffs on the import of foreign goods, strengthening in the applicable foreign currencies relative to domestic currencies, rising foreign wages, increasing input or energy costs or other factors, then demand for foreign goods could decrease. This in turn could result in reduced demand for container leasing. A similar reduction in demand for container leasing could result from an increased use of quotas or other technical barriers to restrict trade. The current regime of relatively free trade may not continue, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe international nature of the container industry exposes us to risks relating to the imposition of import and export duties, quotas, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, and other impediments to trade. These risks increased in recent years due to trade actions taken by the United States and China that led to increased tariffs on goods traded between these two countries. Given the importance of the United States and China in the global economy, these increased tariffs could significantly reduce the volume of goods traded internationally and reduce the rate of global economic growth, leading to decreased demand for leased containers, lower new container prices (which would indirectly reduce the value of the Company\u2019s inventory of containers held for lease) and decreased market leasing rates. These impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLessee defaults may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition by decreasing revenue and increasing storage, repositioning, collection and recovery expenses.\nOur rental equipment is leased to numerous lessees. Lessees are required to pay rent and indemnify us for damage to or loss of equipment. Lessees may default in paying rent and performing other obligations under their leases. A delay or diminution in amounts received under the leases, or a default in the performance of maintenance or other lessee obligations under the leases could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to make payments on our debt.\nOur cash flows from rental equipment, principally rental revenue, are affected significantly by the ability to collect payments under leases and the ability to replace cash flows from terminating leases by re-leasing or selling equipment on favorable terms. All of these factors are subject to external economic conditions and the performance by lessees and service providers that are not within our control.\nIn addition, when lessees default, we may fail to recover all of our equipment, and the equipment we do recover may be returned in damaged condition or to locations where we will not be able to efficiently re-lease or sell the equipment. As a result, we may have to repair and reposition the equipment to other places where we can re-lease or sell it, and we may lose revenue and incur additional operating expenses in repossessing, repositioning and storing the equipment.\nWe also often incur extra costs when repossessing containers from a defaulting lessee. These costs typically arise when our lessee has also defaulted on payments owed to container terminals or depot facilities where the repossessed containers are located. In such cases, the terminal or depot facility will sometimes seek to have us repay a portion of the unpaid bills as a condition before releasing the containers back to us.\nAlthough the container shipping industry is currently enjoying strong demand and significant increases in freight rates, it has been suffering for several years from excess vessel capacity and low freight rates. A number of our customers generated financial losses over the last several years and many are burdened by high levels of debt. In addition, the implementation in 2020 of the IMO 2020 global sulfur cap regulations is likely to increase the financial pressures on shipping lines. These regulations require our customers to either purchase more expensive, low sulfur fuel or invest large amounts to install sulfur scrubbers for their existing ships.\nWe maintain insurance to reimburse us and third-party investors for customer defaults. The insurance agreements are subject to deductibles of $3.5 million per occurrence, depending on the customer\u2019s credit rating, and have significant exclusions. Our level of insurance coverage in 2021 is limited to $27.0 million per occurrence and in aggregate, depending on the customer\u2019s credit rating, and may not be sufficient to prevent us from suffering material losses. Additional insurance claims made by the Company may result in such insurance not being available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant impact to businesses and supply chains globally. The imposition of work and travel restrictions, as well as other actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak, led to a significant decline in the global economy in the first half of 2020, including extended shutdowns of certain businesses, lower factory production, reduced volumes of global imports and exports and disruptions in global shipping. This led to reduced container demand, which pressured container lease rates in the first half of 2020, and increased the credit risk profile of our shipping line customers. Following the easing of measures to contain the spread of the pandemic and the initial reopening of businesses, trade volumes and container demand recovered strongly in the third quarter of 2020. However, many countries are seeing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, including our main demand locations in China, and there continues to be a high degree of risk and uncertainty with respect to the outlook for global economic conditions, global trade and container demand. Further, in response to the pandemic, many businesses, including ourselves, have implemented remote working arrangements for their employees that may continue, in whole or in part, for an extended period. Risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on our business include, but are not limited to:\n\uf0b7increased credit concerns relating to our shipping line customers as they face operational disruptions and increased costs relating to the pandemic, including the risk of bankruptcy or significant payment defaults or delays;\n\uf0b7reduced demand for rental equipment and increased pressure on lease rates;\n\uf0b7reduced demand for sale of rental equipment and increased pressure on sale rates;\n\uf0b7operational issues that could prevent our rental equipment from being discharged or picked up in affected areas or in other locations after having visited affected areas for a prolonged period of time;\n\uf0b7business community risks associated with the transition to remote working arrangements, including increased cybersecurity risks, internet capacity constraints or other systems problems, and unanticipated difficulties or delays in our financial reporting processes;\n\uf0b7liquidity risks, including that disruptions in financial markets as a result of the pandemic may increase the cost and availability of capital, and the risk of non-compliance with financial covenants in debt agreements;\n\uf0b7potential impacts on key management, including health impacts and distractions caused by the pandemic response; and\n\uf0b7potential impacts on business relationships due to restrictions on travel.\nAlthough the impact on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been significant to date, if the pandemic continues to cause business disruption and negatively impact the global economy, then its impact could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in global trade cause our business to experience cyclicality.\nMarket conditions in our industry have historically experienced high level of cyclicality, with periods of strong growth in global trade and high demand for containers followed by periods of weak conditions. Market conditions were exceptionally strong during the second half of 2020 after being weak for much of 2019 and the first half of 2020, but the current outlook for the global economy, global trade and the container leasing market are highly uncertain due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nNew container prices have also experienced a high level of volatility and are currently at record highs. A decrease in new container prices typically negatively impacts our profitability by reducing lease rates and the sale prices we receive for our equipment. These impacts can be severe when new container prices are low for an extended period of time.\nLease rates may decrease due to a decrease in new container prices, weak leasing demand, increased competition or other factors, resulting in reduced revenues, lower margins, and reduced profitability and cash flows.\nMarket lease rates are typically a function of, among other things, new equipment prices (which are heavily influenced by steel prices), interest rates, the type and length of the lease, the equipment supply and demand balance at a particular time and location, and other factors more fully described below. A decrease in lease rates can have a materially adverse effect on our leasing revenues, profitability and cash flow.\nA decrease in market lease rates negatively impacts the lease rates on both new container investments and existing containers in our fleet. Most of our existing containers are on operating leases, which means that the lease term is shorter than the expected life of the container, so the lease rate we receive for the container is subject to change at the expiration of the current lease. A decrease in new container prices from their current record highs, widespread availability of attractively priced financing, and aggressive competition for new leasing transactions could put pressure on market lease rates. As a result, during periods of low market lease rates, the average lease rate received for our containers is negatively impacted by both the addition of new containers at low lease rates as well as, and more significantly, by the turnover of existing containers from leases with higher lease rates to leases with lower lease rates.\n\u200e\nWe may incur significant costs to reposition containers.\nWhen lessees return containers to locations where supply exceeds demand, we may make a decision to reposition containers to higher demand areas rather than sell the container and realize a loss on sale. Repositioning expenses vary depending on geographic location, distance, freight rates and other factors. We seek to limit the number of units that can be returned and in some cases, impose surcharges on containers returned to areas where demand for such containers is not expected to be strong. However, market conditions may not enable us to continue such practices. In addition, we may not accurately anticipate which port locations will be characterized by high or low demand in the future, and our current contracts will not protect us from repositioning costs if ports that we expect to be high-demand ports turn out to be low-demand ports at the time leases expire.\nWe may incur asset impairment charges and additional depreciation expense.\nAsset impairment charges may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows generated from our long-lived assets. We review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We may be required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of prolonged reductions in demand for specific container types, an extended weak economic environment, persistent challenging market conditions, events related to particular customers or asset type, or as a result of asset or portfolio sale decisions by management. If an asset, or group of assets, is considered to be impaired, it may also indicate that the residual value of the associated equipment type needs to be reduced. For example, we reduced the residual value for 40-foot high cube dry van containers from $1,650 to $1,400 per container, effective July 1, 2016. If residual values of our rental equipment are lowered further, then our depreciation expense will increase, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation and concentration in the container shipping industry could decrease the demand for leased containers.\nWe primarily lease containers to container shipping lines. The container shipping lines have historically relied on a large number of leased containers to satisfy their needs. Consolidation of major container shipping lines, such as between Maersk and Hamburg S\u00fcd in 2017, or the creation of operating alliances between shipping lines, such as the formation of ONE, a joint venture between NYK, Mitsui OSK and K Line, in 2018, could create efficiencies for the shipping lines and decrease demand for leased containers, because they may be able to fulfill a larger portion of their needs through their owned container fleets. It would also create increased concentration of credit risk if the number of our container lessees decreases due to consolidation. Additionally, large container shipping lines with significant resources could choose to purchase their own containers directly, which would decrease their demand for leased containers and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, decreased demand from shipping companies for leased containers could also occur due to consolidation caused by the financial failure of container shipping companies, such as the bankruptcy of Hanjin during 2016.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of container lessees. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these container lessees, or a default from any large container lessee, could result in a significant loss of revenue and cash flow.\nWe have derived, and believe that we will continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue and cash flow from a limited number of container lessees. Billings from our ten largest container lessees represented 62.5% of total billings for the year ended December 31, 2020, with billings from our two largest container lessees accounting for 17.1% and 10.2%, respectively, of total billing, or $69.8 million and $41.6 million, respectively. As our business grows, and as consolidation continues among our shipping line customers, we expect the proportion of revenue generated by our larger customers to continue to increase. The loss of a recently-consolidated customer such as those noted above would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a default by any of our largest lessees would result in a major reduction in our leasing revenue, large repossession expenses, potentially large lost equipment charges and a material adverse impact on our performance and financial condition. Although we maintain insurance against customer defaults, our insurance is limited and may not be sufficient to cover such a default.\nChanges in market price or availability of containers in China could adversely affect our ability to maintain our supply of containers.\nThe vast majority of intermodal containers are currently manufactured in China, and we currently purchase almost all of our containers from manufacturers based there. In addition, the container manufacturing industry in China is highly concentrated. In 2019, Dong Fang International Container purchased several of the manufacturing facilities of Singamas Container Holdings Limited, further consolidating the container manufacturing industry. If it became more expensive for us to procure containers in China because of further consolidation among container suppliers, a dispute with one of our manufacturers, increased tariffs imposed by the United States or other governments or for any other reason, we may have to seek alternative sources of supply. We may not be able to make alternative arrangements quickly enough to meet our equipment needs, and the alternative arrangements may increase our costs.\n\u200e\nIt may become more expensive for us to store our off-hire containers.\nWe are dependent on third-party depot operators to repair and store our equipment in port areas throughout the world. In many of these locations the land occupied by these depots is increasingly being considered as prime real estate. Accordingly, local communities are considering increasing restrictions on depot operations which may increase their costs of operation and in some cases force depots to relocate to sites further from port areas. Additionally, depots in prime locations may become filled to capacity based on market conditions and may refuse additional containers due to space constraints. This could require us to enter into higher-cost storage agreements with third-party depot operators in order to accommodate our customers\u2019 turn-in requirements and could result in increased costs and expenses for us. If these changes affect a large number of our depots, it could significantly increase the cost of maintaining and storing our off-hire containers.\nFluctuations in the price of new containers could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew container prices, which dropped to record lows in the first quarter of 2016, have recently increased to record highs. It is uncertain for how long the current container prices will continue. If new container prices decrease, the per diem lease rates for new leases of older, off-lease containers would also be expected to decrease and the prices obtained for containers sold at the end of their useful life would also be expected to decrease. Although new and used container prices are currently at record highs, if the price of new containers declines such that market per diem lease rates or resale values for containers are reduced, our revenue and income could decline. A continuation of these factors could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, even if a sustained reduction in price would allow us to purchase new containers at a lower cost.\nUsed container sale prices may decrease, leading to losses on the sale of used rental equipment.\nAlthough our revenues primarily depend upon equipment leasing, our profitability is also affected by the gains or losses we realize on the sale of used containers because, in the ordinary course of our business, we sell certain containers when they are returned to us. The volatility of the selling prices and gains or losses from the disposal of such equipment may be significant. Used container selling prices, which can vary substantially, depend upon, among other factors, the cost of new containers, the global supply and demand balance for containers, the location of the containers, the supply and demand balance for used containers at a particular location, the repair condition of the container, refurbishment needs, materials and labor costs and equipment obsolescence. Most of these factors are outside of our control.\nContainers are typically sold if it is in our best interest to do so, after taking into consideration earnings prospects, book value, remaining useful life, condition and repair costs, storage costs, suitability for leasing or other uses, and the prevailing local sales price for containers. Gains or losses on the disposition of used containers will fluctuate and may be significant if we sell large quantities of used containers.\nUsed container selling prices and the gains or losses that we have recognized from selling used containers have varied widely over recent years. During 2015 and 2016, disposal prices were close to, and in many cases below, our residual values which resulted in losses being incurred on the sales of used equipment. As a result of consistent losses being recorded on the sale of 40-foot high cube dry van containers, we reduced the residual value for these containers from $1,650 to $1,400 per container, effective July 1, 2016. Sales prices for used containers recovered from the lows of 2016, resulting in gains being recognized on the sale of used equipment. If used container prices decline, we may incur losses on the sale of used containers, our residual values may need to be reduced, resulting in increased depreciation expense, and we may incur impairment charges on such equipment. A decline in these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face extensive competition in the container leasing industry.\nWe may be unable to compete favorably in the highly competitive container leasing business. We compete with a number of major leasing companies, many smaller lessors, companies and financial institutions offering finance leases, promoters of equipment ownership and leasing as a tax-efficient investment, container shipping lines (which sometimes lease their excess container stocks), and suppliers of alternative types of containers for freight transport. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources, better access to capital, lower cost of capital, better credit ratings, more containers, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with lessees, longer operating histories, stronger brand recognition and greater marketing resources than us, or are affiliates of larger companies. Additionally, some of these competitors may have large, underutilized inventories of equipment, which could lead to significant downward pressure on per diem rates, margins and prices of equipment.\nOur business requires large amounts of working capital to fund our operations. We are aware that some of our competitors have had ownership changes and there has been consolidation in the industry in recent years. As a consequence, these competitors may have greater resources available to aggressively seek to expand their market share. This could include offering lease rates with which we may not be able to effectively compete. We may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors.\nCompetition among container leasing companies depends upon many factors, including, among others, per diem rates; lease terms, including lease duration, drop-off restrictions and repair provisions; customer service; and the location, availability, quality and individual characteristics of equipment units. The highly competitive nature of our industry may reduce lease rates and margins and undermine our ability to maintain our current level of container utilization or achieve our growth plans.\nThe international nature of our business exposes us to numerous risks.\nOur ability to enforce lessees\u2019 obligations will be subject to applicable law in the jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. As containers are predominantly located on international waterways, it is not possible to predict, with any degree of certainty, the jurisdictions in which enforcement proceedings may be commenced. For example, repossession from defaulting lessees may be difficult and more expensive in jurisdictions in which laws do not confer the same security interests and rights to creditors and lessors as those in the United States and in other jurisdictions where recovery of containers from defaulting lessees is more cumbersome. As a result, the relative success and expedience of enforcement proceedings with respect to containers in various jurisdictions cannot be predicted.\nWe are also subject to risks inherent in conducting business across national boundaries, any one of which could adversely impact our business. These risks include:\n\uf0b7regional or local economic downturns;\n\uf0b7changes in governmental policy or regulation;\n\uf0b7restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of the countries in which we operate;\n\uf0b7consequences from changes in tax laws, including tax laws pertaining to container investors;\n\uf0b7value-added tax and other sales-type taxes which could result in additional costs to us if they are not properly collected or paid;\n\uf0b7domestic and foreign customs and tariffs;\n\uf0b7international incidents, including epidemics and pandemics;\n\uf0b7public health issues;\n\uf0b7war, hostilities, terrorist attacks, piracy, or the threat of any of these events;\n\uf0b7government instability;\n\uf0b7nationalization of foreign assets;\n\uf0b7government protectionism;\n\uf0b7compliance with export controls, including those of the U.S. Department of Commerce;\n\uf0b7compliance with import procedures and controls, including those of the DHS;\n\uf0b7potential liabilities relating to foreign withholding taxes;\n\uf0b7labor or other disruptions at key ports;\n\uf0b7difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\uf0b7restrictive local employment laws; and\n\uf0b7restrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses in these jurisdictions.\nOne or more of these factors could impair our current or future international operations and, as a result, harm our overall business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur costs associated with new security regulations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to regulations promulgated in various countries, including the United States, seeking to protect the integrity of international commerce and prevent the use of equipment for international terrorism or other illicit activities. For example, the Container Security Initiative, the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism and Operation Safe Commerce are among the programs administered by the DHS that are designed to enhance security for cargo moving throughout the international transportation system by identifying existing vulnerabilities in the supply chain and developing improved methods for ensuring the security of containerized cargo entering and leaving the United States. Moreover, the CSC applies to new and existing containers and seeks to maintain a high level of safety of human life in the transport and handling of containers by providing uniform international safety regulations. As these regulations develop and change, we may incur compliance costs due to the acquisition of new, compliant equipment and/or the adaptation of existing equipment to meet new requirements imposed by such regulations. Additionally, certain companies are currently developing or may in the future develop products designed to enhance the security of equipment transported in international commerce. Regardless of the existence of current or future government regulations mandating the safety standards of intermodal shipping equipment, industry participants may adopt such products or our equipment lessees may insist that we adopt such products. In responding to such market pressures, we may incur increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEnvironmental regulations may result in equipment obsolescence or require substantial investments to retrofit existing equipment. Additionally, environmental concerns are leading to significant design changes for new containers that have not been extensively tested, which increases the likelihood that we could face technical problems.\nMany countries, including the United States, restrict, prohibit or otherwise regulate the use of chemical refrigerants due to their ozone depleting and global warming effects. Our refrigerated containers currently use various refrigerants. Manufacturers of cooling machines for refrigerated containers are testing units that utilize alternative refrigerants, as well as natural refrigerants such as carbon dioxide, that may have less global warming potential than current refrigerants. If future regulations prohibit the use or servicing of containers of current refrigerants, we could be forced to incur large retrofitting expenses. In addition, refrigerated containers that are not retrofitted may become difficult to lease, command lower rental rates and disposal prices, or may have to be scrapped.\nHistorically, the foam insulation in the walls of intermodal refrigerated containers required the use of a blowing agent that contains chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The manufacturers producing our refrigerated containers have eliminated the use of this blowing agent in the manufacturing process, but a large number of our refrigerated containers manufactured prior to 2014 contain these CFCs. The EU prohibits the import and the placing on the market in the EU of intermodal containers with insulation made with such process. However, we believe international conventions governing free movement of intermodal containers allow the use of such intermodal refrigerated containers in the EU if they have been admitted into the EU countries on temporary customs admission. We have procedures in place that we believe comply with the relevant EU and country regulations. If future international conventions or regulations prohibit the use or servicing of containers with foam insulation that utilized this blowing agent change, we could be forced to incur large retrofitting expenses and those containers that are not retrofitted may become more difficult to lease and command lower rental rates and disposal prices.\nAn additional environmental concern affecting our operations relates to the materials and processes used to construct our dry containers. The floors of dry containers are plywood, usually made from tropical hardwoods. Due to concerns regarding de-forestation of tropical rain forests and climate change, many countries which have been the source of these hardwoods have implemented severe restrictions on the cutting and export of these woods. Accordingly, container manufacturers have switched a significant portion of production to more readily available alternatives such as birch, bamboo, and other farm-grown wood species. Container users are also evaluating alternative designs that would limit the amount of plywood required and are also considering possible synthetic materials to replace the plywood. These new woods or other alternatives have not proven their durability over the typical 13-15 year life of a dry container, and if they cannot perform as well as the hardwoods have historically, the future repair and operating costs for these containers could be significantly higher and the useful life of the containers may be decreased.\nFor environmental reasons, container manufacturers have replaced solvent-based paint systems with water-based paint systems for dry container production. Water-based paint systems require more time and care for proper application, and there is an increased risk that the paint will not adhere properly to the steel for the expected useful life of the containers. In addition, some of our refrigerated container manufacturers have recently announced planned changes to the panel treatment and painting processes for refrigerated containers, and we are concerned these changes may lead to decreased protection from the paint system. Poor paint coverage and adherence leads to premature rusting, increased maintenance cost over the life of the container and could result in a shorter useful life.\nChina has implemented regulations restricting the impact of solid wastes, and these regulations are limiting the import into China of old refrigerated containers destined for material recycling. These regulations may limit the disposal demand for non-working refrigerated containers and could result in a decrease in refrigerated container disposal prices which could have a significant negative impact on our profitability and cash flows.\nOur senior executives are critical to the success of our business and our inability to retain them or recruit new personnel could adversely affect our business.\nMost of our senior executives and other management-level employees have over 15 years of industry experience. We rely on this knowledge and experience in our strategic planning and in our day-to-day business operations. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to retain our senior management, the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our success also depends on our ability to retain our experienced sales force and technical personnel as well as recruiting new skilled sales, marketing and technical personnel. Competition for these individuals in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel. In addition, uncertainty regarding our exploration of strategic alternatives may harm our ability to retain and recruit our key personnel. If we fail to retain and recruit the necessary personnel, our business and our ability to obtain new equipment lessees and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer.\n\u200e\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information technology systems and expose us to a liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data on our systems and networks, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure storage, processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite security measures we employ, our information technology systems and networks may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, cause us to breach our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations, create an inability to access or rely upon critical business records or cause other disruptions of our business. Despite our existing security procedures and controls, if our network becomes compromised, it could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships, harm our business, our reputation, and our financial results, which could result in fines or lawsuits, and may increase the costs we incur to protect against such information security breaches, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws, and costs resulting from consumer fraud. These breaches may result from human error, equipment failure, or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties.\nWe expend significant financial resources to protect against such threats and may be required to further expend financial resources to alleviate problems caused by physical, electronic, and cyber security breaches. As techniques used to breach security are growing in frequency and sophistication and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, regardless of our expenditures and protection efforts, we may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, loss of existing or potential future customers, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results.\nIn the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, we may be liable for damages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks despite not handling the data. Further, the regulatory framework around data custody, data privacy and breaches varies by jurisdiction and is an evolving area of law. We may not be able to limit our liability or damages in the event of such a loss.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to conduct our business. If these systems fail to adequately perform their functions, or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our business, results of operations and financial prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is highly dependent on our information technology systems. We rely on our systems to track transactions, such as repair and depot charges and changes to book value, and movements associated with each of our owned or managed equipment units. We use the information provided by our systems in our day-to-day business decisions in order to effectively manage our lease portfolio and improve customer service. We also rely on them for the accurate tracking of the performance of our managed fleet for each third-party investor, and the tracking and billing of logistics moves. The failure of our systems to perform as we expect could disrupt our business, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and cause our relationships with lessees and third-party investors to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power loss and computer systems failures, unauthorized breach and viruses. Any such interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial prospects.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates could reduce our profitability.\nMost of our revenues and costs are billed in U.S. dollars. Our operations and used equipment sales in locations outside of the U.S. have some exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, and trade growth and the direction of trade flows can be influenced by large changes in relative currency values. In addition, most of our container equipment fleet is manufactured in China. Although the purchase price is in U.S. dollars, our manufacturers pay labor and other costs in the local currency, the Chinese yuan. To the extent that our manufacturers\u2019 costs increase due to changes in the valuation of the Chinese yuan, the dollar price we pay for equipment could be affected. Adverse or large exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u200e\nActual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, or the outbreak of war and hostilities could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability.\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of such attacks have contributed to economic instability in the United States and elsewhere, and further acts or threats of terrorism, violence, war or hostilities could similarly affect world trade and the industries in which we and our customers operate. In addition, terrorist attacks or hostilities may directly impact ports, depots, our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, and could impact our sales and our supply chain. A severe disruption to the worldwide ports system and flow of goods could result in a reduction in the level of international trade and lower demand for our equipment or services. Any of these events could also negatively affect the economy and consumer confidence, which could cause a downturn in the transportation industry. The consequence of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations\nIt is also possible that our equipment could be involved in a terrorist attack. Although our lease agreements require our lessees to indemnify us against all damages arising out of the use of our containers, and we carry insurance to potentially offset any costs in the event that our customer indemnifications prove to be insufficient, our insurance does not cover certain types of terrorist attacks, and we may not be fully protected from liability of the reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes one of our containers.\nOur operations could be affected by natural or man-made events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.\nWe have operations in locations subject to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, the outbreak of contagious disease, or man-made incidents such as chemical explosions, any of which could disrupt our operations. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. For example, in 2015, a chemical explosion and fire in the port of Tianjin, China damaged or destroyed a small number of our containers and disrupted operations in the port. Similarly, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 virus, H1N1 (swine) flu and the Ebola virus, could significantly reduce the demand for international shipping or could prevent our containers from being discharged in the affected areas or in other locations after having visited the affected areas. Any future natural or man-made disasters or health concerns in the world where we have business operations could lead to disruption of the regional and global economies, which could result in a decrease in demand for leased containers.\nCertain liens may arise on our equipment.\nDepot operators, repairmen and transporters may come into possession of our equipment from time to time and have sums due to them from lessees or sub-lessees of equipment. In the event of nonpayment of those charges by lessees or sub-lessees, we may be delayed in, or entirely barred from, repossessing equipment, or be required to make payments or incur expenses to discharge liens on our equipment.\nThe lack of an international title registry for containers increases the risk of ownership disputes.\nThere is no internationally recognized system of recordation or filing to evidence our title to containers nor is there an internationally recognized system for filing security interests in containers. Although we have not incurred material problems with respect to this lack of an internationally recognized system, the lack of an international title recordation system for containers could result in disputes with lessees, end-users, or third parties who may improperly claim ownership of the containers.\nIndebtedness and Finance Risks\nOur level of indebtedness reduces our financial flexibility and could impede our ability to operate.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and we intend to borrow additional amounts under our credit facilities to purchase equipment and make acquisitions and other investments. We expect that we will maintain a significant amount of indebtedness on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2020, our total outstanding debt was $1,758.5 million. Interest expense on such debt will be $9.3 million per quarter for 2021, assuming floating interest rates remain consistent with those as of December 31, 2020. There is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service and repay our debt, or to refinance our outstanding indebtedness when it becomes due, or, if refinancing is available, that it can be obtained on terms that we can afford.\nSome of our credit facilities require us to pay a variable rate of interest, which will increase or decrease based on variations in certain financial indices, and increases in interest rates can significantly decrease our profits. In 2020, we entered into a five-year interest rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on $500.0 million of our variable-rate borrowings.\nThe amount of our indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including the following:\n\uf0b7requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, future business opportunities and other purposes;\n\uf0b7limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\uf0b7making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, and any failure to comply with such obligations, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness, which could lead to, among other things, an acceleration of our indebtedness or foreclosure on the assets securing our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\n\uf0b7making it difficult for us to pay dividends on, or repurchase, our common stock, our Series A Preferred Stock or our Series B Preferred Stock;\n\uf0b7placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors having less debt;\n\uf0b7limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, or to sell assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes; and\n\uf0b7increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service and repay our debt and related obligations and have sufficient funds left over to achieve or sustain profitability in our operations, meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs or compete successfully in our industry.\nOur credit facilities impose, and the terms of any future indebtedness may impose, significant operating, financial and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries.\nRestrictions imposed by our credit facilities or other indebtedness will limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\uf0b7incur additional indebtedness;\n\uf0b7pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase our stock;\n\uf0b7enter into new lines of business;\n\uf0b7issue capital stock of our subsidiaries (except to the Company);\n\uf0b7make loans and certain types of investments;\n\uf0b7create liens;\n\uf0b7sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\uf0b7enter into certain transactions with stockholders and affiliates; and\n\uf0b7restrict dividends, distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries.\nThese restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities. A breach of any of these restrictions, including a breach of financial covenants, could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness, which would constitute substantially all of our equipment assets.\nThe expected replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may have an impact on our business and the trading price of our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021. As a result, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021 and it is likely that LIBOR will be phased out or modified by 2023. The FCA and the submitting LIBOR banks have indicated they will support the LIBOR indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. Financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating the phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) was tasked with identifying alternative reference rates to replace LIBOR. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) has emerged as the ARRC\u2019s preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by the Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or other alternative reference rates. In addition, it is uncertain what methods of calculating a replacement rate will be adopted generally or whether different industry bodies, such as the loan market and the derivative market, will adopt the same methodologies.\n\u200e\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $797.5 million of debt outstanding on facilities with interest rates based on LIBOR. Our credit facilities include fallback language that seeks to facilitate an agreement with our lenders on a replacement rate for LIBOR in the event of its discontinuance. We cannot predict what reference rate would be agreed upon or what the impact of any such replacement rate would be to our interest expense. Potential changes to the underlying floating-rate indices and reference rates may have an adverse impact on our liabilities indexed to LIBOR and could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Furthermore, we cannot predict or quantify the time, effort and cost required to transition to the use of new benchmark rates, including with respect to negotiating and implementing any necessary changes to existing contractual agreements, and implementing changes to our systems and processes. We continue to evaluate the operational and other effects of such changes.\nIn addition, on and after April 15, 2023, with respect to our Series A Preferred Stock, and August 15, 2023, with respect to our Series B Preferred Stock, such series preferred stock will each have a floating dividend rate set each dividend period at an annual rate based in part on LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes as a result of the discontinuation of LIBOR, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the UK or elsewhere. Furthermore, if we or the calculation agent for the applicable series of preferred stock determine that Three-Month LIBOR (as defined in the applicable certificate of designations) has been permanently discontinued, the calculation agent will use an alternative rate, as further detailed in the applicable certificate of designations. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect the trading market for LIBOR-based securities, including our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock.\nTax and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to legislative, regulatory, and legal developments involving taxes.\nTaxes are a significant part of our expenses. We exercise significant judgement in calculating our worldwide tax provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may limit their accuracy. We are currently under examination in Barbados for the 2019 tax year, and may be subject to examinations in the future in this, and other, jurisdictions. Relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income, payroll, property, sales and use, and other types of taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in a material effect to our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Higher tax rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe operate in numerous tax jurisdictions and are subject to not only the phase-in of current tax regulations or changes in the applicable tax regulations in those jurisdictions, but may also be subject to tax authorities within any of these jurisdictions challenging our operating structure or revising the interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Should any of these events occur it could result in additional taxes, interest and penalties that could materially impact our financial conditions and our future financial results.\nWe are headquartered in the United States as a Delaware corporation, and also operate through a number of international subsidiaries. We are subject to the tax regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate in addition to United States tax regulations. We have structured our Company and its domestic and international subsidiaries to minimize our income tax obligations, however, under certain circumstances our tax structure could result in additional U.S. or foreign taxes. There can be no assurance that our current effective tax rate will not change in the future or that our tax structure and the amount of taxes we pay in any of these countries will not be challenged by the relevant taxing authorities. If the tax authorities challenge our tax positions or the amount of taxes paid for the purchase, lease or sale of equipment in each jurisdiction in which we operate, we could incur substantial expenses associated with defending our tax position as well as expenses associated with the payment of any additional taxes, penalties and interest that may be imposed on us. The payment of these amounts could have an adverse material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegislation recently enacted in Bermuda and Barbados requiring registered entities within those jurisdictions to establish domestic economic substance could have a material adverse impact on our future financial results.\nWe seek to minimize our overall tax liability through the use of a tax efficient corporate structure of our international subsidiaries. As part of that effort, we have established an asset owning subsidiary registered in Barbados and multiple special purpose vehicles registered in Bermuda. While this structure has effectively reduced our overall tax liability, there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case, particularly if the structure is challenged by one or more governmental agencies within those jurisdictions or the structure otherwise becomes non-compliant with applicable law. The failure to be able to maintain the above tax efficient corporate structure, and any fines or penalties that could be imposed as a result of challenges to the structure, could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, and future financial and operational results.\n\u200e\nBarbados and Bermuda have both enacted legislation that could have a material impact upon our subsidiaries located in those jurisdictions. In 2019 Barbados enacted the Companies (Economic Substance) Act, 2019 and in 2018 Bermuda enacted the Economic Substance Act 2018. Both sets of legislation require affected Barbados and Bermuda registered companies to maintain a substantial economic presence in their respective countries. It is anticipated that the guidelines which assist in the interpretation and application of the legislation, will be revised periodically within those jurisdictions, but this legislation could require us to incur additional costs to achieve compliance, and/or result in the imposition of significant penalties, and possibly require us to re-domicile our registered subsidiaries to a jurisdiction with higher tax rates. As noted, because the details surrounding implementation of this legislation are still developing, we cannot predict the impact of the economic substance requirements on our Company. However, the results of our business operations and future financial performance could be materially adversely affected depending on whether, and to the extent, we become subject to this legislation and/or other unanticipated tax liabilities.\nWe may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nChanges in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, or regulations, to address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy. Customers\u2019 increased costs could reduce their demand to lease our assets. Potential consequences of laws, rules, or regulations addressing climate change could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and a determination that we violated this act may affect our business and operations adversely.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. Violations of the FCPA could result in fines and penalties; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries; and a materially negative effect on our company and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners, or agents will not violate our policies. Any perception or determination that we have violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulations that impact our international operations, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including economic sanctions, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, import and export and similar laws. In recent years, we have seen a substantial increase in the enforcement of many of these laws in the United States and other countries. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, result in significant additional compliance requirements and costs, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, result in the loss of customers, restrict our operations and limit our ability to grow our business, adversely affect our results of operations, and harm our reputation.\nRisks Related to our Stock\nOur common stock price has been volatile and may remain volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in operating results, new products or services by us or our competitors, general conditions in the shipping industry and the intermodal equipment sales and leasing markets, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, or other events or factors which may or may not be under our control. Broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Since the initial public offering of our common stock at $15.00 per share on May 16, 2007, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly. Since the trading volume of our common stock is modest on a daily basis, shareholders may experience difficulties in liquidating our common stock at an acceptable price. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include, among others:\n\uf0b7variations in our financial results;\n\uf0b7changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by any securities analysts following our business;\n\uf0b7the public\u2019s response to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\uf0b7our ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n\uf0b7changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\uf0b7future sales of common stock by us or our directors, officers or significant stockholders or the perception such sales may occur;\n\uf0b7our ability to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections;\n\uf0b7the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us;\n\uf0b7recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\uf0b7our ability to timely address changing equipment lessee and third-party investor preferences;\n\uf0b7equipment market and industry factors;\n\uf0b7the size of our public float;\n\uf0b7general stock market conditions; and\n\uf0b7other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events.\nIn addition, if the market for companies deemed similar to us or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business or financial results. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nFuture new sales of our common stock or preferred stock by us or outstanding shares by existing stockholders, or the perception that there will be future sales of new shares from us or existing stockholders, may cause our common stock or preferred stock price, as applicable, to decline and impair our ability to obtain capital through future stock offerings.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock to raise additional capital. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock, preferred stock or convertible securities, will dilute the ownership interest of our common and preferred stockholders. In addition, our greater than 5% stockholders may sell a substantial number of their shares in the public market, which could also affect the market price for our common and preferred stock. We cannot predict the size of future sales or issuances of our common or preferred stock or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common and preferred stock. The issuance and/or sale of substantial amounts of common or preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances and/or sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common or preferred stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or debts securities.\nDividends now paid to holders of our common stock may need to be reduced or eliminated.\nAlthough our board of directors has approved a dividend policy under which we pay cash dividends on our common stock, any determinations by us to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be based upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, investment in rental equipment, tax considerations and our board of directors\u2019 continuing quarterly determination that the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements. In addition, the terms of our credit agreements contain provisions restricting the amount of cash dividends subject to certain exceptions. Consequently, investors may be forced to rely more so or completely on sales of their common stock to realize returns on investment.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us and consequently decrease the market value of an investment in our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware corporate law each contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management. Among other things, these provisions:\n\uf0b7authorize us to issue preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\uf0b7permit removal of directors only for cause by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the election of directors and allow only the directors to fill a vacancy on the board of directors;\n\uf0b7prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\uf0b7prohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\uf0b7require the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote to amend our bylaws and certain articles of our certificate of incorporation, including articles relating to the classified board, the size of the board, removal of directors, stockholder meetings and actions by written consent;\n\uf0b7allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\uf0b7establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting;\n\uf0b7classify our board of directors into three classes so that only a portion of our directors are elected each year; and\n\uf0b7allow our directors to amend our bylaws.\n\u200e\nThese provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions, which may prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which makes unfriendly takeover more difficult, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us, which shareholders not affiliated with the takeover group might favor. Any delay or prevention of a change in control or change in management that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe change of control conversion right in our preferred stock may make it more difficult for a party to acquire us or discourage a party from acquiring us.\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control, each holder of shares of our outstanding preferred stock will have the right (subject to certain conditions) to convert some or all of the shares of preferred stock held by such holder (the \u201cChange of Control Conversion Right\u201d). The Change of Control Conversion Right may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing certain of our change of control transactions under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our preferred stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price of such equity securities or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.", "PERMNO": 91979, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "CAI"}
