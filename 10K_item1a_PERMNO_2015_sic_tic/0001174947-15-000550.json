RISK FACTORS\nOur non-performing assets could expose us to increased risk of loss, which may negatively affect our earnings.\nOur non-performing assets have remained at elevated levels over the past few years primarily as a result of loans made prior to the economic recession. At December 31, 2014, we had total non-performing assets of $13.1 million, or 2.5% of total assets, a $4.4 million increase from December 31, 2013 and a $4.9 million increase from December 31, 2012. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on non-accrual loans or investments in real estate owned. We must reserve for probable losses, which are established through a current period charge to income in the provision for loan losses, and from time to time, write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract us from the overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities of Northeast Community Bank. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly. At December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses amounted to 0.9% of total loans outstanding and 87.6% of nonperforming loans.\nOur recent expansion into construction loans could expose us to increased lending risks.\nOur construction loans and our participations in construction loans present a greater level of risk than loans secured by improved, occupied real estate due to: (1) the increased difficulty at the time the loan is made of estimating the building costs and the selling price of the property to be built; (2) the increased difficulty and costs of monitoring the loan; (3) the higher degree of sensitivity to increases in market rates of interest; and (4) the increased difficulty of working out loan problems. In addition, construction costs may exceed original estimates as a result of increased materials, labor or other costs. Construction loans also often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or refinance the indebtedness. We have sought to minimize these risks by limiting the amount of construction loans outstanding at any time, by limiting our construction loans to borrowers who have in effect pre-sold their construction project, and by limiting our construction loans to mixed-use, multi-family and single family projects. We have eliminated the risks involved in purchased participation construction loans by no longer engaging in these transactions. At December 31, 2014, $46.6 million, or 10.9%, of our loan portfolio consisted of construction loans.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had three construction loan participations that we purchased in August 2007 that subsequently converted into permanent loans in 2012 with an aggregate outstanding balance of $6.1 million at December 31, 2014. This balance represents our 25% participation interests in the loans, which are secured by a hotel. We currently do not buy participation interests in construction loans.\nOur emphasis on multi-family residential, mixed-use and non-residential real estate lending and our recent expansion into commercial and industrial lending could expose us to increased lending risks.\nOur primary business strategy centers on continuing our emphasis on multi-family, mixed-use, and non-residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2014, $332.2 million, or 77.9%, of our loan portfolio consisted of multi-family residential, mixed-use and non-residential real estate loans. As a result, our credit risk profile is generally higher than traditional thrift institutions that have higher concentrations of one- to four-family residential loans.\nLoans secured by multi-family, mixed-use and non-residential real estate generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the underlying property. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified on the basis of the property\u2019s net income and debt service ratio; however, there is no assurance that our underwriting policies will protect us from credit-related losses.\nIndex\nAs with loans secured by multi-family, mixed-use and non-residential real estate, commercial and industrial loans tend to be of higher risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. We seek to minimize the risks involved in commercial and industrial lending by underwriting such loans on the basis of the cash flows produced by the business; by requiring that such loans be collateralized by various business assets, including inventory, equipment, and accounts receivable, among others; and by requiring personal guarantees, whenever possible. However, the capacity of a borrower to repay a commercial and industrial loan is substantially dependent on the degree to which his or her business is successful. In addition, the collateral underlying such loans may depreciate over time, may not be conducive to appraisal, or may fluctuate in value, based upon the business\u2019 results. At December 31, 2014, $34.4 million, or 8.1%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be inadequate, which could hurt our earnings.\nWhen borrowers default and do not repay the loans that we make to them, we may lose money. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio at the statement of financial condition date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. If our estimates and judgments regarding such matters prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses might not be sufficient, and additional loan loss provisions might need to be made. Depending on the amount of such loan loss provisions, the adverse impact on our earnings could be material. Our allowance for loan losses amounted to 0.9% of total loans outstanding and 87.6% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2014. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2014 may not be sufficient to cover loan losses. A large loss or series of losses could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect earnings.\nIn addition, bank regulators may require us to make a provision for loan losses or otherwise recognize further loan charge-offs following their periodic review of our loan portfolio, our underwriting procedures, and our loan loss allowance. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by such regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Please see \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d for a discussion of the procedures we follow in establishing our loan loss allowance.\nChanges in interest rates may have a negative impact on earnings and asset values.\nOur net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investment less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding. Changes in interest rates-up or down-could adversely affect our net interest margin and, as a result, our net interest income. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up. Changes in the slope of the \u201cyield curve\u201d-or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates-could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management-Interest Rate Risk Management.\u201d\nIndex\nStrong competition within our primary market area and our lending territory could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nWe face intense competition both in making loans in our lending territory and attracting deposits in our primary market area. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and at times has forced us to offer higher deposit rates. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which would reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits. As of June 30, 2014, the most recent date for which information is available from the FDIC, we held approximately 0.01% of the deposits in New York County, New York, approximately 0.56% and 0.12% of the deposits in Bronx and Westchester Counties, New York, respectively, and 0.17%, 0.49%, 0.11% and 0.04% of the deposits in Essex, Plymouth, Norfolk and Middlesex Counties, Massachusetts, respectively. Competition also makes it more difficult to hire and retain experienced employees. Some of the banks with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our primary market area and our lending territory.\nThe market price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected by market volatility.\nMany publicly traded financial services companies have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance or prospects of such companies. We may experience market fluctuations that are not directly related to our operating performance but are influenced by the market\u2019s perception of the state of the financial services industry in general and, in particular, the market\u2019s assessment of general credit quality conditions, including default and foreclosure rates in the industry.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Northeast Community Bancorp, MHC and Northeast Community Bancorp are subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of Northeast Community Bank rather than for holders of Northeast Community Bancorp common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nCapital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital. The impact of these capital rules on our financial condition and operations is uncertain but could be materially adverse.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule for the Basel III capital framework. These rules substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules phase in over time beginning in 2015 and will become fully effective in 2019. The rules apply to the Company as well as to the Bank. Beginning in 2015, our minimum capital requirements will be (i) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (common Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% (up from 4%) and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (the current requirement). Our leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4% level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the common Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a require common Tier 1 equity ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nRegulatory reform legislation may have a material effect on the value of our stock.\nIn 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) was passed, which imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes. The key effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business are:\nIndex\n\u2022 changes to regulatory capital requirements;\n\u2022 creation of new government regulatory agencies (such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which oversees systemic risk, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which develops and enforces rules for bank and non-bank providers of consumer financial products);\n\u2022 potential limitations on federal preemption;\n\u2022 changes to deposit insurance assessments;\n\u2022 regulation of debit interchange fees we earn;\n\u2022 changes in retail banking regulations, including potential limitations on certain fees we may charge; and\n\u2022 changes in regulation of consumer mortgage loan origination and risk retention.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act restricts the ability of banks to engage in certain proprietary trading or to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions designed to limit the ability of insured depository institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates to conduct certain swaps and derivatives activities and to take certain principal positions in financial instruments.\nSome provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately upon its enactment. Many provisions, however, will require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies to be implemented, some but not all of which have been proposed or finalized by the applicable federal agencies. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may have unintended effects, which will not be clear until after implementation. Certain changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to investors in our common stock. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision - Federal Banking Regulation - Capital Requirements\u201d for a discussion of regulatory capital requirements.\nNortheast Community Bancorp, MHC\u2019s majority control of our common stock will enable it to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders and will prevent stockholders from forcing a sale or a second-step conversion transaction you may like.\nThe MHC owns a majority of Northeast Community Bancorp\u2019s common stock and, through its board of directors, will be able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders. The same directors and officers who manage Northeast Community Bancorp and Northeast Community Bank also manage the MHC. As a federally chartered mutual holding company, the board of directors of the MHC must ensure that the interests of depositors of Northeast Community Bank are represented and considered in matters put to a vote of stockholders of Northeast Community Bancorp. Therefore, the votes cast by the MHC may not be in your personal best interests as a stockholder. For example, the MHC may exercise its voting control to defeat a stockholder nominee for election to the board of directors of Northeast Community Bancorp. In addition, stockholders will not be able to force a merger or second-step conversion transaction without the consent of the MHC. Some stockholders may desire a sale or merger transaction, since stockholders typically receive a premium for their shares, or a second-step conversion transaction, since fully converted institutions tend to trade at higher multiples than mutual holding companies.\nIndex\nThe amount of dividends we pay on our common stock, if any, may be limited by the ability of Northeast Community Bancorp, MHC to waive receipt of dividends.\nThe MHC owns a majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding stock. As a result, when and if the Company pays dividends to its shareholders, it also is required to pay dividends to the MHC unless the MHC is permitted by its federal regulator to waive the receipt of dividends. Historically, the MHC\u2019s federal regulator has permitted the MHC to waive its right to dividends declared by the Company on the shares that it owns.\nThe Federal Reserve Board, as successor regulatory agency to the Office of Thrift Supervision for the MHC, has adopted regulations which require the MHC to notify the Federal Reserve Board if it proposes to waive receipt of dividends from the Company. In addition, the regulations require that the MHC obtain the approval of a majority of the eligible votes of members of the MHC (generally Bank depositors) before it can waive dividends. For a grandfathered company such as the MHC that waived dividends prior to December 1, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board may not object to a dividend waiver request if the board of directors of the mutual holding company expressly determines that a waiver of the dividend is consistent with its fiduciary duties to members and the waiver would not be detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the savings association subsidiaries of the holding company.\nThe MHC has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board to waive dividends paid by the Company during the 12 months following November 25, 2014. It is expected that the MHC will continue to waive future dividends, except to the extent dividends are needed to fund the MHC\u2019s continuing operations, and subject to the ability of the MHC to obtain regulatory approval in the future of its requests to waive dividends.\nWhile the MHC is grandfathered for purposes of the Federal Reserve Board dividend waiver regulations, we cannot assure that the Federal Reserve Board will grant dividend waiver requests in the future and, if granted, there can be no assurance as to the conditions, if any, the Federal Reserve Board will place on future dividend waiver requests. The denial of a dividend waiver request or the imposition of burdensome conditions on an approval of a waiver request may significantly limit the amount of dividends the Company pays in the future, if any.\nThe Federal Reserve Board policy on remutualization transactions could prohibit acquisition of Northeast Community Bancorp, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nCurrent Federal Reserve Board regulations permit a mutual holding company to be acquired by a mutual institution in a remutualization transaction. However, Northeast Community Bancorp\u2019s former regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, had adopted a policy statement indicating that it viewed remutualization transactions as raising significant issues concerning disparate treatment of minority stockholders and mutual members of the target entity and raising issues concerning the effect on the mutual members of the acquiring entity. The Federal Reserve Board has not adopted a similar policy statement or issued on the matter and future Federal Reserve Board regulation may negatively affect Northeast Community Bancorp. Under certain circumstances, the Federal Reserve Board may give these issues special scrutiny and reject applications providing for the remutualization of a mutual holding company unless the applicant can clearly demonstrate that the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s concerns are not warranted in the particular case. Should the Federal Reserve Board prohibit or otherwise restrict these transactions in the future, our per share stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to a variety of operational risks, environmental, legal and compliance risks, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by the Bank can also result in negative public opinion about our other businesses.\nIf personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be misappropriated, mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, erroneously providing such information to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or the interception or inappropriate acquisition of such information by third parties.\nIndex\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters, disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets) which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and to the risk that our (or our vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in our diminished ability to operate our business (for example, by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect), as well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, perhaps materially.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers whereby systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, we provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet and over the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could materially and adversely affect us.\nAdditionally, financial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 91405, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "NECB"}
