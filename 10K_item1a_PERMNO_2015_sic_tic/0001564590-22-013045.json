Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to our Business -- General Risks\n\u2022\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline.\n\u2022\nAny future acquisitions that we make may prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources.\n\u2022\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\n\u2022\nOur investments in other businesses and entry into new business ventures may adversely affect our operations.\n\u2022\nOur organizational documents and Delaware law may make it harder for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation of our Board of Directors and management.\n\u2022\nWe may inadvertently become subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, which would limit our business operations and require us to spend significant resources to comply with the Investment Company Act.\n\u2022\nWe are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions.\n\u2022\nWe are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions.\n\u2022\nA reversal of the U.S. economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the United States or abroad could adversely affect our business or our access to capital markets in a material manner.\n\u2022\nWe may be adversely affected by the effects of inflation.\nRisks Relating to Our Planned Cryptocurrency Mining Business\n\u2022\nOur cryptocurrency mining business is in an early stage of development and may not be able to generate revenues or achieve profitability.\n\u2022\nOur lack of operating history in the cryptocurrency mining business makes evaluating our business difficult.\n\u2022\nWe will likely need to raise additional capital to fund our planned cryptocurrency mining business.\n\u2022\nOperating results may fluctuate due to the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to maintain power and hosting arrangements or secure sites for data centers, our business results may suffer.\n\u2022\nBitcoin mining activities are energy-intensive, which may restrict the geographic locations of miners and have a negative environmental impact. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours, or even fully or partially ban mining operations.\n\u2022\nWe may be affected by price fluctuations in the wholesale and retail power markets.\n\u2022\nWe will be vulnerable to severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including severe heat, earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, as well as power outages and other industrial incidents, which could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to risks related to disruptions or other failures in the supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware and difficulties in obtaining new hardware.\n\u2022\nThe properties in our mining network may experience damages, including damages that are not covered by insurance.\nRisks Related to the Specialty Finance Business\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to purchase Accounts at favorable prices, or on sufficiently favorable terms, or at all.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to recover sufficient amounts on our Accounts to recover charges to the Accounts for interest and late fees necessary to fund our operations.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to intense competition seeking to provide a collection solution to Associations for delinquent Accounts.\n\u2022\nWe are dependent upon third-party law firms to service our Accounts.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to access external sources of financing, we may not be able to fund and grow our operations.\n\u2022\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness from time to time in connection with the purchase of Accounts and could be subject to risks associated with incurring such indebtedness.\n\u2022\nWe may encounter difficulties managing changes in our business including cyclical growth and declines, which could disrupt our operations, and there is no assurance that any such growth (if experienced) can be sustained.\n\u2022\nGovernment regulations may limit our ability to recover and enforce the collection of our Accounts.\n\u2022\nWe may become regulated under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and have not developed compliance standards for such oversight.\n\u2022\nCurrent and new laws may adversely affect our ability to collect our Accounts, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\n\u2022\nClass action suits and other litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention from operating our business, increase our expenses, and otherwise harm our business.\n\u2022\nIf our technology and software systems are not operational or are subject to cybersecurity incidents, our operations could be disrupted and our ability to successfully acquire and collect Accounts could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nInsolvency of BLG Association Law, PLLC (\u201cBLGAL\u201d) which is our primary law firm could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nAssociations do not make any guarantee with respect to the validity, enforceability or collectability of the Accounts acquired by us.\n\u2022\nAll of our Accounts are located in Florida, and any adverse conditions affecting Florida could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nForeclosure on an Association\u2019s lien may not result in our company recouping the amount that we invested in the related Account.\n\u2022\nIf Account debtors or their agents make payments on the Accounts to or negotiate reductions in the Accounts with an Association, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nAccount debtors are subject to a variety of factors that may adversely affect their payment ability.\n\u2022\nDefaults on the Accounts could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nWe depend on the skill and diligence of third parties to collect the Accounts.\n\u2022\nThe payoff amounts received by us from Accounts may be adversely affected due to a variety of factors beyond our control.\n\u2022\nThe liens securing the Accounts we own may not be superior to all liens on the related units and homes.\n\u2022\nWe may not choose to pursue a foreclosure action against condominium and home owners who are delinquent in paying off the Accounts relating to their units or homes.\n\u2022\nThe holding period for our Accounts from purchase to payoff is indeterminate.\n\u2022\nOur business model and related accounting treatment may result in acceleration of expense recognition before the corresponding revenues can be recognized.\nRisk Related to Our Investment in LMF Acquisition Opportunities, Inc.\n\u2022\nWe have made a significant investment in a special purpose acquisition company (\u201cSPAC\u201d), and will suffer the loss of all of our investment if the SPAC does not complete an acquisition within 18 months or July 29, 2022 (subject to an extension of up to 21 months).\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\n\u2022\nOur common shares and warrants could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\u2022\nFuture sales of our common stock by our affiliates or other stockholders may depress our stock price.\n\u2022\nThe market price and trading volume of our shares of common stock may be volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock (as the case may be) at or above the price you paid for them.\nRisks Relating to our Business -- General Risks\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline.\nBecause of the nature of our business, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our results may fluctuate as a result of the following factors:\n(i)\nthe timing and amount of collections on our Account portfolio;\n(ii)\nour inability to identify and acquire additional Accounts;\n(iii)\na decline in the value of our Account portfolio recoveries;\n(iv)\nincreases in operating expenses associated with the growth of our operations; and\n(v)\ngeneral, economic and real estate market conditions.\nAny future acquisitions that we make may prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources.\nWe may seek to grow through acquisitions of related businesses. Such acquisitions present risks that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance, including:\n(i)\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our everyday business activities;\n(ii)\nthe assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n(iii)\nthe contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of, and other unanticipated problems arising in, the acquired business; and\n(iv)\nthe need to expand our management, administration and operational systems to accommodate such acquired business.\nIf we make such acquisitions we cannot predict whether:\n(i)\nwe will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses into our business;\n(ii)\nwe will realize any anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions; or\n(iii)\nthere will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with such acquisitions.\nIn addition, future acquisitions by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt, and the recognition of significant charges for depreciation and amortization related to goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAlthough we have no definitive plans or intentions to make acquisitions of related businesses, we continuously evaluate such potential acquisitions. However, we have not reached any agreement or arrangement with respect to any particular acquisition and we may not be able to complete any acquisitions on favorable terms or at all.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility and uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global economic slowdown that may last for a potentially extended duration, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. Deteriorating economic and political conditions caused by COVID-19, such as increased unemployment, decreases in capital spending, declines in customer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services.\nWhile our employees currently have the ability and are encouraged to work remotely, such measures have had, and may continue to have, an impact on employee attendance or productivity, which, along with the possibility of employees\u2019 illness, may adversely affect our operations. Although COVID-19 is currently not material to our results of operations, there is uncertainty relating to the potential future impact on our business. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations, or our ability to obtain financing should we require it, will depend on future developments which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by governments and private businesses to contain COVID-19 to treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 continue for an extended period of time, financial markets may not be available to the Company for raising capital in order to fund future growth. Should the Company not be able to obtain financing when required, in the amounts necessary or under terms which are economically feasible, we may be required to reduce planned future growth and/or the scope of our operations. In addition, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of COVID-19, may result in legal claims or litigation against us.\nA threatened direct and derivative claim by one of our stockholders against the Company and our officers and directors could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn March 9, 2022, legal counsel to a purported stockholder of the Company threatened to file a direct and derivative complaint alleging breaches of fiduciary duty by the Company\u2019s officers and directors, primarily with respect to (i) the Amended and Restated Employment Agreements entered into by the Company with each of Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Russell in October 2021; (ii) the approval of actions taken at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders in December 2021; (iii) payments\nmade to Business Law Group, P.A. in exchange for services provided pursuant to the Services Agreement between the Company and Business Law Group; and (iv) strategic advisory agreements entered into by us in connection with our planned cryptocurrency mining business.\nOur board of directors is evaluating the matters raised by the purported stockholder and his legal counsel and is determining the actions, if any, that should be taken by the Company with respect to those matters. There can be no assurance as to whether any litigation will be commenced against the Company\u2019s officers and directors with respect to the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, legal action has not been taken by the purported stockholder.\nIn the event an action is commenced and the resulting case is decided adversely, we may be liable for significant damages directly or under our indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there can be no assurance (i) that we will not incur material losses due to damages, costs and/or expenses as a result of threatened litigation, (ii) that our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policy and the liabilities we have established or may establish will be sufficient to cover such losses or (iii) that such losses will not materially exceed the coverage limits of our insurance and such liabilities will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, the amount of time that will be required to resolve any threatened litigation is unpredictable, and this threatened action is likely to divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could further adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur investments in other businesses and entry into new business ventures may adversely affect our operations.\nWe previously made and subsequently disposed of, and may in the future acquire, interests in companies or may commence operations in businesses and industries that are not identical to those with which we have historically engaged. If these investments or arrangements are not successful, our earnings could be materially adversely affected by increased expenses and decreased revenues.\nOur organizational documents and Delaware law may make it harder for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation of our Board of Directors and management.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of our common stock. Under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. In addition, our directors serve staggered terms of one to three years each and, as such, at any given annual meeting of our stockholders, only a portion of our Board of Directors may be considered for election, which may prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our Board of Directors at certain annual meetings and may entrench our management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals. The ability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discourage takeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current Board of Directors.\nWe may inadvertently become subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, which would limit our business operations and require us to spend significant resources to comply with the Investment Company Act.\nWe run the risk of inadvertently being deemed to be an investment company that is required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d) because a significant portion of our assets may be deemed to consist of, or may be deemed to have consisted of, investment securities, including potentially our interest in LMF Acquisition Opportunities, Inc. and our transactions with BORQS Technologies. The risk varies depending on events beyond our control, such as significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of our assets, and transactions involving the sale and purchase of certain assets. If we are deemed to be an inadvertent investment company, we may seek to rely on a safe-harbor under the Investment Company Act that would provide us a one-year period to take steps to avoid being deemed to be an investment company.\nThe Investment Company Act defines an \u201cinvestment company\u201d as an issuer that is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the issuer's unconsolidated assets, excluding cash items and securities issued by the federal government. While the Investment Company Act also has several exclusions and exceptions that we would seek to rely upon to avoid being deemed an investment company, our reliance on any such exclusions or exceptions may be misplaced resulting in violation of the Investment Company Act, the consequences of which can be significant.\nA company that falls within the scope of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act can avoid being regulated as an investment company if it can rely on certain of the exclusions or exemptions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion is Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act. Rule 3a-2 of the Investment Company Act provides that inadvertent or transient investment companies will not be treated as investment companies subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act, provided the issuer has the requisite intent to be engaged in a non-investment business, evidenced by the issuer\u2019s business activities and an appropriate resolution of the issuer\u2019s board of directors, within one year from the commencement of the earlier of (1) the date on which the issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the value of such issuer's total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis, or (2) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities (as defined in section 3(a) of the Exchange Act) having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer's total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\nIn order to ensure we avoid being deemed an investment company, we have taken, and may need to continue to take, steps to reduce the percentage of our assets that constitute investment securities under the Investment Company Act. These steps have included, among others, selling investment securities that we might otherwise hold for the long-term and deploying our cash in assets that are not investment securities. We may be forced to sell our investment securities at unattractive prices or to sell assets that we otherwise believe benefit our business in the future to remain below the requisite threshold. We may also seek to acquire additional assets to maintain compliance with the Investment Company Act, and we may need to incur debt, issue additional equity, or enter into other financing arrangements that are not otherwise attractive to our business. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe can make no assurance that we would successfully be able to take the necessary steps to avoid being deemed to be an investment company in accordance with the safe-harbor. If we were unsuccessful, then we would have to register as an investment company, and we would be unable to operate our business in its current form. We would be subject to extensive, restrictive, and potentially adverse statutory provisions and regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, indebtedness, dividends, and transactions with affiliates. If we were deemed to be an investment company and did not register as an investment company when required to do so, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, and/or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period in which we were an unregistered investment company.\nWe are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions.\nU.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops was reported. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions. We are continuing to monitor the situation in Ukraine and globally and assessing its potential impact on our business.\nAdditionally, the recent military conflict in Ukraine has led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union and other countries against Russia. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more difficult for us to obtain additional funds.\nAlthough our business has not been materially impacted by the ongoing military conflict between Russian and Ukraine to date, it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations, or those of our suppliers and manufacturers, will be impacted in the short and long term, or the ways in which the conflict may impact our business. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this Annual Report.\nA reversal of the U.S. economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the United States or abroad could adversely affect our business or our access to capital markets in a material manner.\nWorsening economic and market conditions, downside shocks, or a return to recessionary economic conditions could severely reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results. These economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure product to meet our customers\u2019 demand. Our results of operations and the implementation of our business strategy could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy. An economic downturn may cause uncertainty in the capital and credit markets and could have a material adverse effect on us. We could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates, weak economies, and political conditions in each of the countries in which we sell our products.\nWe may be adversely affected by the effects of inflation.\nInflation has the potential to adversely affect our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience, cost increases. Although we may take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation, if these measures are not effective our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Even if such measures are effective, there could be a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost inflation is incurred.\nRisks Relating to Our Planned Cryptocurrency Mining Business\nOur cryptocurrency mining business is in an early stage of development. If we are not able to develop our business as anticipated, we may not be able to generate revenues or achieve profitability and you may lose your investment.\nWe have no operating history in the cryptocurrency mining business and have not earned any revenues to date in such business. Although we believe that our planned cryptocurrency mining business significant profit potential, we may not attain profitable operations and our management may not succeed in realizing our business objectives. If we are not able to develop our business as anticipated, we may not be able to generate revenues or achieve profitability and you may lose your investment.\nOur lack of operating history in the cryptocurrency mining business makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and increases the risk of an investment in our securities.\nWe have no operating history in the cryptocurrency mining business upon which an investor may evaluate our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. It is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our planned cryptocurrency mining business. Furthermore, we plan to focus our business on cryptocurrency, and specifically Bitcoin, mining, a new and developing field, which could further exacerbate the risks. In the event that actual results differ from our plans and expectations, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe will likely need to raise additional capital to fund our planned cryptocurrency mining business and purchase related equipment, and such capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe have entered into agreements under which we have agreed to purchase a substantial number of cryptocurrency mining machines, and we will have escalating operating expenses associating with developing our planned cryptocurrency mining business. Accordingly, we will likely require additional capital to fund our planned equipment purchases and to respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics or technologies, customer demands, business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances. Accordingly, we will likely need to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for the above-mentioned or other reasons. We may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds through equity financing, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution.\nFurthermore, any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies in general and, specifically, Bitcoin.\nThe revenue from our cryptocurrency mining business will be dependent on cryptocurrencies and, specifically, Bitcoin and the broader blockchain and Bitcoin mining ecosystem. Due to the highly volatile nature of the cryptocurrency markets and the prices of cryptocurrency assets, our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in accordance with market sentiments and movements in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are unpredictable and in certain instances are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment, or actions by governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\n\u2022\nadverse legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions, judgments, settlements, or other legal proceeding and enforcement-related costs;\n\u2022\nincreases in operating expenses that we expect to incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;\n\u2022\nsystem errors, failures, outages and computer viruses, which could disrupt our ability to continue mining;\n\u2022\npower outages and certain other events beyond our control, including natural disasters and telecommunication failures;\n\u2022\nbreaches of security or privacy;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain talent; and\n\u2022\nour ability to compete with our existing and new competitors.\nAs a result of these factors, it may be difficult for us to forecast growth trends accurately and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate, particularly in the short term.\nIf we are unable to successfully maintain our power and hosting arrangements or secure the sites for our data centers, on acceptable terms or at all, or if we must otherwise relocate to replacement sites, our operations may be disrupted, and our business results may suffer.\nAs part of the planned build out of our cryptocurrency mining operations, we plan to set up or lease cryptocurrency mining facilities (or sites). Actually securing these sites on terms acceptable to our management team may not occur within our timing expectations or at all. Although we have entered into agreements with Uptime Armory and Uptime Hosting to provide cargo containers and hosting services, our inability to secure sites for our data centers could adversely impact the anticipated timing of our initial buildout phase and therefore the time by which we are able to commence our operations.\nBitcoin mining activities are energy-intensive, which may restrict the geographic locations of miners and have a negative environmental impact. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours, or even fully or partially ban mining operations.\nMining Bitcoin requires massive amounts of electrical power, and electricity costs are expected to account for a significant portion of our overall costs. The availability and cost of electricity will restrict the geographic locations of our mining activities. Any shortage of electricity supply or increase in electricity costs in any location where we plan to operate may negatively impact the viability and the expected economic return for Bitcoin mining activities in that location.\nFurther, our business model can only be successful and our mining operations can only be profitable if the costs, including electrical power costs, associated with Bitcoin mining are lower than the price of Bitcoin itself. As a result, any mining operation we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical power for that site on a cost-effective basis, and our establishment of new mining data centers requires us to find sites where that is the case. Even if our electrical power costs do not increase, significant fluctuations in, and any prolonged periods of, low Bitcoin prices may also cause our electrical supply to no longer be cost-effective.\nFurthermore, there may be significant competition for suitable cryptocurrency mining sites, and government regulators, including local permitting officials, may potentially restrict our ability to set up cryptocurrency mining operations in certain locations. They can also restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations in times of electricity shortage, or may otherwise potentially restrict or prohibit the provision of electricity to mining operations. In addition, if cryptocurrency mining becomes more widespread, government scrutiny related to restrictions on cryptocurrency mining facilities and their energy consumption may significantly increase. The considerable consumption of electricity by mining operators may also have a negative environmental impact, including contribution to climate change, which could set the public opinion against allowing the use of electricity for Bitcoin mining activities or create a negative consumer sentiment and perception of Bitcoin, specifically, or cryptocurrencies, generally. This, in turn, could lead to governmental measures restricting or prohibiting cryptocurrency mining or the use of electricity for Bitcoin mining activities. Any such development in the jurisdictions where we plan to operate could increase our compliance burdens and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. Government regulators in other countries may also ban or substantially limit their local cryptocurrency mining activities, which could have a material effect on our supply chains for mining equipment or services and the price of Bitcoin. It could also increase our domestic competition as some of those cryptocurrency miners or new entrants in this market may consider moving their cryptocurrency mining operations or establishing new operations in the United States.\nAdditionally, our mining operations could be materially adversely affected by power outages and similar disruptions. Given the power requirements for our mining equipment, it would not be feasible to run this equipment on back-up power generators in the event of a government restriction on electricity or a power outage. If we are unable to receive adequate power supply and are forced to reduce our operations due to the availability or cost of electrical power, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may be affected by price fluctuations in the wholesale and retail power markets.\nA substantial portion of our power and hosting arrangements will likely contain certain price adjustment mechanisms in case of certain events. Furthermore, a portion of our power and hosting arrangements will likely include merchant power prices, or power prices reflecting market movements.\nMarket prices for power, generation capacity and ancillary services, are unpredictable. Depending upon the effectiveness of any price risk management activity undertaken by us, an increase in market prices for power, generation capacity, and ancillary services may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. Long- and short-term power prices may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreases and decreases in generation capacity;\n\u2022\nchanges in power transmission or fuel transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;\n\u2022\nvolatile weather conditions, particularly unusually hot or mild summers or unusually cold or warm winters;\n\u2022\ntechnological shifts resulting in changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage, including the potential development of demand-side management tools, expansion and technological advancements in power storage capability and the development of new fuels or new technologies for the production or storage of power;\n\u2022\nfederal and state power, market and environmental regulation and legislation; and\n\u2022\nchanges in capacity prices and capacity markets.\nIf we are unable to secure power supply at prices or on terms acceptable to us, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe will be vulnerable to severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including severe heat, earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, as well as power outages and other industrial incidents, which could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business will be subject to the risks of severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including severe heat, earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, as well as power outages and other industrial incidents, any of which could result in system failures, power supply disruptions and other interruptions that could harm our business.\nThe majority of our power and hosting arrangements have merchant power prices, or power prices reflecting the market movements. In an event of a major power outage, the merchant power prices could be too high to make Bitcoin mining profitable. To extent the power prices increase significantly as result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters or any\nother causes, resulting in contract prices for power being significantly lower than current market prices, the counterparties under our power and hosting arrangements may refuse to supply power to us during that period of fluctuating prices.\nFrom time to time, we may consider protecting against power price movements by adopting a more risk averse power procurement strategy and hedging our power purchase prices, which would translate into additional hedging costs for us.\nFurthermore, state or regional government officials to introduce new legislation and requirements on power providers that may result in, among other things, restrictions on cryptocurrency mining operations in general.\nWe will be exposed to risks related to disruptions or other failures in the supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware and difficulties in obtaining new hardware.\nManufacture, assembly and delivery of certain components and products for mining operations could be complex and long processes, in the course of which various problems could arise, including disruptions or delays in the supply chain, product quality control issues, as well other external factors, over which we have no control.\nOur mining operations can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs associated with Bitcoin mining, including hardware costs, are lower than the price of Bitcoin itself. In the course of the normal operation of our cryptocurrency mining facilities, our miners and other critical equipment and materials related to datacenter construction and maintenance, such as containers, switch gears, transformers and cables, will experience ordinary wear and tear and may also face more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond our control. Declines in the condition of our miners and other hardware will require us, over time, to repair or replace those miners. Additionally, as the technology evolves, we may be required to acquire newer models of miners to remain competitive in the market. Any upgrading process may require substantial capital investment, and we may face challenges in doing so on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nOur mining business will be subject to limitations inherent within the supply chain of certain of our components, including competitive, governmental, and legal limitations, and other events. For example, we expect that we will significantly rely on foreign imports to obtain certain equipment and materials. Any global trade disruption, introductions of tariffs, trade barriers and bilateral trade frictions, together with any potential downturns in the global economy resulting therefrom, could adversely affect our necessary supply chains. Our third-party manufacturers, suppliers and subcontractors may also experience disruptions by worker absenteeism, quarantines, restrictions on employees\u2019 ability to work, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, or other travel or health-related restrictions, such as those that were triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. Depending on the magnitude of such effects on our supply chain, shipments of parts for our miners, or any new miners that we order, may be delayed.\nFurthermore, the global supply chain for cryptocurrency miners is currently heavily dependent on China, which has been severely affected by the China as a main supplier of cryptocurrency miners has been called into question in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. China has also in the past limited the shipment of products in and out of its borders, which could negatively impact our ability to receive mining equipment from our China-based suppliers. Should similar outbreaks or other disruptions to the China-based global supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware occur, such as, for example, as result of worsening of the U.S. trade relations with China, including imposition of new tariffs, trade barriers and bilateral trade frictions, we may not be able to obtain adequate equipment from the manufacturer on a timely basis. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe properties in our mining network may experience damages, including damages that are not covered by insurance.\nAny cryptocurrency mining sites we establish will be subject to a variety of risks relating to physical condition and operation, including:\n\u2022\nthe presence of construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage;\n\u2022\nany noncompliance with, or liabilities under, applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements;\n\u2022\nany damage resulting from extreme weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and snow or windstorms; and\n\u2022\nclaims by employees and others for injuries sustained at our properties.\nFor example, our cryptocurrency mining facilities could be rendered inoperable, temporarily or permanently, as a result of, among others, a fire or other natural disasters. The security and other measures we anticipate to take to protect against these risks may not be sufficient.\nAdditionally, our mines could be materially adversely affected by a power outage or loss of access to the electrical grid or loss by the grid of cost-effective sources of electrical power generating capacity.\nRisks Related to the Specialty Finance Business\nWe may not be able to purchase Accounts at favorable prices, or on sufficiently favorable terms, or at all.\nOur success depends upon the continued availability of Association Accounts. The availability of Accounts at favorable prices and on terms acceptable to us depends on a number of factors outside our control, including:\n(i)\nthe status of the economy and real estate market in markets which we have operations may become so strong that delinquent Accounts do not occur in sufficient quantities to efficiently acquire them;\n(ii)\nthe perceived need of Associations to sell their Accounts to us as opposed to taking other measures to solve budget problems such as increasing assessments; and\n(iii)\ncompetitive pressures from law firms, collections agencies, and others to produce more revenue for Associations than we can provide through the purchase of Accounts.\nIn addition, our ability to purchase Accounts, in particular with respect to our original product, is reliant on state statutes allowing for a Super Lien Amount to protect our principal investment; any change of those statutes and elimination of the priority of the Super Lien Amount, particularly in Florida, could have an adverse effect on our ability to purchase Accounts. If we were unable to purchase Accounts at favorable prices or on terms acceptable to us, or at all, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to recover sufficient amounts on our Accounts to recover charges to the Accounts for interest and late fees necessary to fund our operations.\nWe acquire and collect on the delinquent receivables of Associations. Since Account debtors are third parties that we have little to no information about, we cannot predict when any given Account will pay off or how much it will yield. In order to operate profitably over the long term, we must continually purchase and collect on a sufficient volume of Accounts to generate revenue that exceeds our costs.\nWe are subject to intense competition seeking to provide a collection solution to Associations for delinquent Accounts.\nLawyers, collection agencies, and other direct and indirect competitors vying to collect on Accounts all propose to solve the problem delinquent Accounts pose to Associations. Additionally, Associations and their management companies sometimes try to solve their delinquent Account problems in house, without the assistance of third-party collection agencies. An Account that an Association attempts to collect through any of these other options is an Account we cannot purchase and collect. We compete on the basis of reputation, industry experience, performance and financing dollars. Some of these competitors have greater contacts with Associations, greater financial resources and access to capital, more personnel, wider geographic presence and greater resources than we have. In addition, we expect the entry of new competitors in the future given the relatively new nature of the market in which we operate. Aggressive pricing by our competitors could raise the price of acquiring and purchasing Accounts above levels that we are willing to pay, which could reduce the number of Accounts suitable for us to purchase or if purchased by us, reduce the profits, if any, generated by such Accounts. If we are unable to purchase Accounts at favorable prices or at all, the revenues generated by us and our earnings could be materially reduced.\nWe are dependent upon third-party law firms to service our Accounts.\nAlthough we utilize our proprietary software and in-house staff to track, monitor, and direct the collection of our Accounts, we depend upon third-party law firms to perform the collection work. As a result, we are dependent upon the efforts of our third-party law firms, particularly BLG Association Law, PLLC (\u201cBLGAL\u201d) to service and collect our Accounts.\nOn February 1, 2022, LM Funding America, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) consented to the assignment by the law firm of Business Law Group, P.A. to the law firm BLG Association Law, PLLC of the Services Agreement, dated April 15, 2015, previously entered into by the Company and Business Law Group, P.A. (the \u201cServices Agreement\u201d). The Services Agreement had set forth the terms under which Business Law Group, P.A. would act as the primary law firm used by the Company and its\nassociation clients for the servicing and collection of association accounts. The assignment of the Services Agreement was necessitated by the death of the principal attorney and owner of Business Law Group, P.A. In connection with the assignment, BLGAL agreed to amend the Services Agreement on February 1, 2022, to reduce the monthly compensation payable to the law firm from approximately $82,000 to $53,000 (the \u201cAmendment\u201d). Bruce M. Rodgers, the chairman and CEO of the Company, is a 50% owner of BLGAL, and the assignment and Amendment was approved by the independent directors of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2021, BLG was responsible for servicing over 98% of our Accounts. Our revenues and profitability could be materially affected if:\n(i)\nour agreements with the third-party law firms we use are terminated and we are not able to secure replacement law firms or direct payments from Account debtors to our replacement law firms;\n(ii)\nour relationships with our law firms adversely change;\n(iii)\nour law firms fail to adequately perform their obligations; or\n(iv)\ninternal changes at such law firms occur, such as loss of staff who service us.\nIf we are unable to access external sources of financing, we may not be able to fund and grow our operations.\nWe depend upon loans from external sources from time to time to fund and expand our operations. Our ability to grow our business is dependent on our access to additional financing and capital resources. The failure to obtain financing and capital as needed would limit our ability to purchase Accounts and achieve our growth plans.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness from time to time in connection with the purchase of Accounts and could be subject to risks associated with incurring such indebtedness.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness from time to time in connection with the purchase of Accounts and could be subject to risks associated with incurring such indebtedness, including:\n(i)\nwe could be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs and, as a result, we would have less funds available for operations, future acquisitions of Accounts, and other purposes;\n(ii)\nit may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funds through financings, if such funds are available at all;\n(iii)\nwe could be more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in interest rates, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in reacting to changes in our industry and general economic conditions; and\n(iv)\nif we default under any of our existing credit facilities or if our creditors demand payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments.\nWe may encounter difficulties managing changes in our business including cyclical growth and declines, which could disrupt our operations, and there is no assurance that any such growth (if experienced) can be sustained.\nFrom time to time since our inception, we have experienced periods of significant growth and declines. Although there is no assurance that we will again experience periods of significant growth or continued declines in the future, if we do, there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our changing operations effectively or that we will be able to maintain or accelerate our growth, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and control expenses. Future growth will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n(i)\nthe effective and timely initiation and development of relationships with law firms, management companies, accounting firms and other trusted advisors of Associations willing to sell Accounts;\n(ii)\nour ability to continue to develop our proprietary software for use in other markets and with different products;\n(iii)\nour ability to maintain the collection of Accounts efficiently;\n(iv)\nthe recruitment, motivation and retention of qualified personnel both in our principal office and in new markets;\n(v)\nour ability to successfully implement our business strategy in states outside of the state of Florida; and\n(vi)\nour successful implementation of enhancements to our operational and financial systems.\nDue to our limited financial resources and the limited experience and size of our management team, we may not be able to effectively manage the growth of our business. Significant growth may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business strategy or disrupt our operations.\nGovernment regulations may limit our ability to recover and enforce the collection of our Accounts.\nFederal, state and municipal laws, rules, rules, regulations and ordinances may limit our ability to recover and enforce our rights with respect to the Accounts acquired by us. These laws include, but are not limited to, the following federal statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder and comparable statutes in states where Account debtors reside and/or located:\n(i)\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act;\n(ii)\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act;\n(iii)\nthe Truth-In-Lending Act;\n(iv)\nthe Fair Credit Billing Act;\n(v)\nthe Dodd-Frank Act;\n(vi)\nthe Equal Credit Opportunity Act; and\n(vii)\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act.\nWe may be precluded from collecting Accounts we purchase where the Association or its prior legal counsel, management company, or collection agency failed to comply with applicable laws in charging the account debtor or prosecuting the collection of the Account. Laws relating to the collection of consumer debt also directly apply to our business. Our failure to comply with any laws applicable to us, including state licensing laws, could limit our ability to recover our Accounts and could subject us to fines and penalties, which could reduce our revenues.\nWe may become regulated under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and have not developed compliance standards for such oversight.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010), or Dodd-Frank Act, represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act allows consumers free access to their credit score if their score negatively affects them in a financial transaction or a hiring decision, and also gives consumers access to credit score disclosures as part of an adverse action and risk-based pricing notice. Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, within the Federal Reserve Board, and requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. Significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act related to the CFPB became effective on July 21, 2011. The CFPB has broad powers to promulgate, administer and enforce consumer financial regulations, including those applicable to us and possibly our funded Associations. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB is the principal supervisor and enforcer of federal consumer financial protection laws with respect to nondepository institutions, or \u201cnonbanks\u201d, including, without limitation, any \u201ccovered person\u201d who is a \u201clarger participant\u201d in a market for other consumer financial products or services. We do not know if our unique business model makes us a covered person.\nThe CFPB has started to exercise authority to define unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and to require reports and conduct examinations of these entities for purposes of (i) assessing compliance with federal consumer financial protections laws; (ii) obtaining information about the activities and compliance systems or procedures of such entities; and (iii) detecting and assessing risks to consumers and to markets for consumer financial products and services. The exercise of this supervisory authority must be risk-based, meaning that the CFPB will identify nonbanks for examination based on the risk they pose to consumers, including consideration of the entity\u2019s asset size, transaction volume, risk to consumers, existing oversight by state authorities and any other factors that the CFPB determines to be relevant. When a nonbank is in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws, including the CFPB\u2019s own rules, the CFPB may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce those laws and rules. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders, which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief, and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial protection laws to $25,000 per day for reckless violations and $1 million per day for knowing violations. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations under Title X, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties). If the CFPB or one or more state officials believe that we have committed a violation of the foregoing laws, they could exercise their enforcement powers in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAt this time, we cannot predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting rules and regulations, including those of the CFPB, will impact the U.S. economy and our products and services. Compliance with these new laws and regulations\nmay require changes in the way we conduct our business and could result in additional compliance costs, which could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nCurrent and new laws may adversely affect our ability to collect our Accounts, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nCurrently all of our Accounts are located in Florida. But because our Accounts are generally originated and collected pursuant to a variety of federal and state laws by a variety of third parties and may involve consumers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, there can be no assurance that all Associations and their management companies, legal counsel, collections agencies and others have at all times been in compliance with all applicable laws relating to the collection of Accounts. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we or our law firms have been or will continue to be at all times in compliance with all applicable laws. Failure to comply with applicable laws could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our Accounts and could subject us to increased costs, fines, and penalties. Furthermore, changes in state law regarding the lien priority status of delinquent Association assessments could materially and adversely affect our business. Currently all of our Accounts are located in Florida,\nClass action suits and other litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention from operating our business, increase our expenses, and otherwise harm our business.\nCertain originators and servicers involved in consumer credit collection and related businesses have been subject to class actions and other litigation. Claims include failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations such as usury and improper or deceptive origination and collection practices. From time to time we are a party to such litigation, and as a result, our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our everyday business activities and implementing our business strategy, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by, among other things, legal expenses and challenges to our business model in connection with such litigation.\nIf our technology and software systems are not operational or are subject to cybersecurity incidents, our operations could be disrupted and our ability to successfully acquire and collect Accounts could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary software. We must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to properly track, monitor and collect our Accounts. Any failure of our information systems and their backup systems, including by means of cybersecurity attacks, breaches or other incidents, would interrupt our operations. We may not have adequate backup arrangements for all of our operations and we may incur significant losses if an outage occurs. In addition, we rely on third-party law firms who also may be adversely affected in the event of a cybersecurity breach or attack or other outage in which the third-party servicer does not have adequate backup arrangements. Any interruption in our operations or our third-party law firms\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInsolvency of BLGAL could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur primary Account servicer, BLGAL, deposits collections on the Accounts in its Interest on Lawyers Trust Account (\u201cIOLTA Trust Account\u201d) and then distributes the proceeds to itself, us and the Associations pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreements with the Associations and applicable law. We do not have a perfected security interest in the amounts BLGAL collects on the Accounts while such amounts are held in the IOLTA Trust Account. BLGAL has agreed to promptly remit to us all amounts collected on the Accounts that are owed to us. If, however, BLGAL were to become subject to any insolvency law and a creditor or trustee-in-bankruptcy of BLGAL were to take the position that proceeds of the Accounts held in BLGAL\u2019s IOLTA Trust Account should be treated as assets of BLGAL, an Association or another third party, delays in payments from collections on the Accounts held by BLGAL could occur or reductions in the amounts of payments to be remitted by BLGAL to us could result, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAssociations do not make any guarantee with respect to the validity, enforceability or collectability of the Accounts acquired by us.\nAssociations do not make any representations, warranties or covenants with respect to the validity, enforceability or collectability of Accounts in their assignments of Accounts to us. If an Account proves to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise generally uncollectible, we will not have any recourse against the respective Association. If a significant number of our Accounts are later held to be invalid, unenforceable or are otherwise uncollectible, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAll of our Accounts are located in Florida, and any adverse conditions affecting Florida could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur primary business relates to revenues from Accounts purchased by us, which are all based in Florida, and our primary source of revenue consists of payments made by condominium and home-owners to satisfy the liens against their condominiums and homes. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Florida represented 100% of our Accounts. An economic recession, adverse market conditions in Florida, and/or significant property damage caused by hurricanes, tornadoes or other inclement weather could adversely affect the ability of these condominium and home owners to satisfy the liens against their condominiums and homes, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nForeclosure on an Association\u2019s lien may not result in our company recouping the amount that we invested in the related Account.\nAll of the Accounts purchased by us are in default. The Accounts are secured by liens held by Associations, which we have an option to foreclose upon on behalf of the Associations. Should we foreclose upon such a lien on behalf of an Association, we are generally entitled pursuant to our contractual arrangements with the Association to have the Association quitclaim its interests in the condominium unit or home to us. In the event that any Association quitclaims its interests in a condominium unit or home to us, we will be relying on the short-term rental prospects, to the extent permitted under bylaws and rules applicable to the Association, and value of its interest in the underlying property, which value may be affected by numerous risks, including:\n(i)\nchanges in general or local economic conditions;\n(ii)\nneighborhood values;\n(iii)\ninterest rates;\n(iv)\nreal estate tax rates and other operating expenses;\n(v)\nthe possibility of overbuilding of similar properties and of the inability to obtain or maintain full occupancy of the properties;\n(vi)\ngovernmental rules and fiscal policies;\n(vii)\nacts of God; and\n(viii)\nother factors which are beyond our control.\nIt is possible that as a result of a decrease in the value of the property or any of the other factors referred to in this paragraph, the amount realized from the sale of such property after taking title through a lien foreclosure may be less than our total investment in the Account. If this occurs with regard to a substantial number of Accounts, the amount expected to be realized from the Accounts will decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf Account debtors or their agents make payments on the Accounts to or negotiate reductions in the Accounts with an Association, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time Account debtors and/or their agents may make payments on the Accounts directly to the Association or its management company. Our sole recourse in this instance is to recover these misapplied payments through set-offs of payments later collected for that Association by our third-party law firms. A significant number of misapplied or reduced payments could hinder our cash flows and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccount debtors are subject to a variety of factors that may adversely affect their payment ability.\nCollections on the Accounts have varied and may in the future vary greatly in both timing and amount from the payments actually due on the Accounts due to a variety of economic, social and other factors. Failures by Account debtors to timely pay off their Accounts could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDefaults on the Accounts could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe take assignments of the lien foreclosure rights of Associations against delinquent units owned by Account debtors who are responsible for payment of the Accounts. The payoff of the Accounts is dependent upon the ability and willingness of the condominium and home owners to pay such obligations. If an owner fails to pay off the Account relating to his, her or its unit or home, only net amounts recovered, if any, will be available with respect to that Account. Foreclosures by holders of first mortgages generally result in our receipt of reduced recoveries from Accounts. In addition, foreclosure actions by any holder of a tax lien may result in us receiving no recovery from an Account to the extent excess proceeds from such tax lien foreclosure are insufficient to provide for payment to us. If, at any time, (i) we experience an increase in mortgage\nforeclosures or tax lien foreclosures or (ii) we experience a decrease in owner payments, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on the skill and diligence of third parties to collect the Accounts.\nBecause the collection of Accounts requires special skill and diligence, any failure of BLGAL, or any other law firm utilized by us, to diligently collect the Accounts could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe payoff amounts received by us from Accounts may be adversely affected due to a variety of factors beyond our control.\nSeveral factors may reduce the amount that can be collected on any individual Account. The delinquent assessments that are the subject of the Accounts and related charges are included within an Association\u2019s claim of lien under the applicable statute. In Florida, Association liens are recorded in the official county records and hold first priority status with respect to a first mortgage holder for an amount equal to the Super Lien Amount. Associations have assigned to us the right to direct law firms to collect on the liens and foreclose, subject to the terms and conditions of the purchase agreements between each Association and us.\nEach Account presents a separate risk as to the creditworthiness of the debtor obligated to pay the Account, which, in general, is the owner of the unit or home when the Account was incurred and subsequent owners. For instance, if the debtor has incurred a property tax lien, a sale related to such lien could result in our complete loss of the Account. Also, a holder of a first mortgage taking title through a foreclosure proceeding in which the Association is named as a defendant must only pay the Super Lien Amount in a state with a super lien statute. Although we purchase Accounts at a discount to the outstanding balance and the owner remains personally liable for any deficiency, we may decide that it is not cost-effective to pursue such a deficiency. As a result, the purchase or ownership of a significant number of Accounts which result in payment of only the Super Lien Amount or less where no statute specifying a Super Lien Amount applies, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe liens securing the Accounts we own may not be superior to all liens on the related units and homes.\nAlthough the liens of the Associations securing the Accounts may be superior in right of payment to some of the other liens on a condominium unit or home, they may not be superior to all liens on that condominium unit or home. For instance, a lien relating to delinquent property taxes would be superior in right of payment to the liens securing the Accounts. In addition, if an Association fails to assert the priority of its lien in a foreclosure action, the Association may inadvertently waive the priority of its lien. In the event that there is a lien of superior priority on a unit or home relating to one of the Accounts, the Association\u2019s lien might be extinguished in the event that such superior liens are foreclosed. In most instances, the unit or home owner will be liable for the payment of such Account and the ultimate payment would depend on the creditworthiness of such owner. In the case of a tax lien foreclosure, an owner taking title through foreclosure would not be liable for the payment of obligations that existed prior to the foreclosure sale. The purchase or ownership of a significant number of Accounts that are the subject of foreclosure by a superior lien could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not choose to pursue a foreclosure action against condominium and home owners who are delinquent in paying off the Accounts relating to their units or homes.\nAlthough we have the right to pursue a foreclosure action against a unit or home owner who is delinquent in paying off the Account relating to his or her unit or home, we may not choose to do so as the cost of such litigation may be prohibitive, especially when pursuing an individual claim against a single unit or home owner. Our choice not to foreclose on a unit or home may delay our ability to collect on the Account. If we decide not to pursue foreclosure against a significant number of Accounts, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe holding period for our Accounts from purchase to payoff is indeterminate.\nIt can take our third-party law firms anywhere from three months to ten years or longer to collect on an Account. Approximately 65% of our Accounts were purchased prior to 2017, with some being purchased as early as 2008. Due to various factors, including those discussed above, we cannot project the payoff date for any Account. This indeterminate holding period reduces our liquidity and ability to fund our operations. If our ability to collect on a material number of Accounts was significantly delayed, it could adversely affect our cash flows and ability to fund our operations.\nOur business model and related accounting treatment may result in acceleration of expense recognition before the corresponding revenues can be recognized.\nAs we expand our business, we may incur significant upfront costs relating to the acquisition of Accounts. Under United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) such amounts may be required to be recognized in the period that they are expended. However, the corresponding revenue stream relating to the acquisition of such Accounts will not be recognized until future dates. Therefore, we may experience reduced earnings in earlier periods until such time as the revenue stream relating to the acquisition of such Accounts may be recognized.\nRisk Related to Our Investment in LMF Acquisition Opportunities, Inc.\nWe have made a significant investment, through an intercompany loan, in a subsidiary that is the sponsor of a blank check company commonly referred to as a special purpose acquisition company (\u201cSPAC\u201d), and will suffer the loss of all of our investment if the SPAC does not complete an acquisition within 18 months (subject to an extension of up to 21 months).\nIn January 2021, we made an intercompany loan of $5.7 million to a majority owned subsidiary, LMFAO Sponsor, LLC (\u201cSponsor\u201d), that served as the sponsor of LMF Acquisition Opportunities, Inc., a special purpose acquisition company (\u201cLMF Acquisition\u201d). The loan was made to fund Sponsor\u2019s purchase of private placement warrants of LMF Acquisition as a part of the sponsorship of LMF Acquisition. Prior to a business combination by LMF Acquisition, Sponsor holds 100% of the shares of Class B common stock outstanding of LMF Acquisition. The Class B shares equal approximately 20% of the outstanding common stock of LMF Acquisition. The Company owns approximately a 70% interest in the Sponsor. Upon the successful completion of a business combination by LMF Acquisition, the proforma ownership of the new company will vary depending on the business combination terms.\nThere is no assurance that LMF Acquisition will be successful in completing a business combination or that any business combination will be successful. The Company can lose its entire investment in Sponsor if a business combination is not completed within 18 months (subject to potential extension to up to 21 months) or if the business combination is not successful, which may materially adversely impact our stockholder value.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nOur common shares and warrants could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOver the past two years, the Company has received notification letters from Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Continued Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires the Company\u2019s listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share.\nIf a suspension or delisting were to occur, there would be significantly less liquidity in the suspended or delisted securities. In addition, our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing would be greatly impaired. Furthermore, with respect to any suspended or delisted common shares, we would expect decreases in investor demand, market making activity and information available concerning trading prices and volume. Additionally, fewer broker-dealers would be willing to execute trades with respect to such common shares. A suspension or delisting would likely decrease the attractiveness of our common shares to investors and cause the trading volume of our common shares to decline, which could result in a further decline in the market price of our common shares.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our affiliates or other stockholders may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock. We had authorized 350,000,000 shares of common stock and 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock as of December 31, 2021.\nWe had 13,017,943 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021. In addition, pursuant to our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan, options to purchase 3,956,827 shares of our common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2021, of which 3,760 shares were exercisable. There were 7,702,441 warrants issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 that allowed for the issuance of 7,702,441 shares, respectively.\nWe may issue additional shares in connection with our business and may grant additional stock options or restricted shares to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our present or future equity compensation plans or we may issue warrants to third parties outside of such plans. If a significant portion of these shares were sold in the public market, the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe market price and trading volume of our shares of common stock may be volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock (as the case may be) at or above the price you paid for them.\nOur securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for it, in which case, holders of our securities may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, our securities. In addition, when the market price of a company\u2019s\nequity drops significantly, equity holders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources away from the day-to-day operations of our business.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage of our securities or may issue negative reports, which may adversely affect the trading price of our securities.\nWe cannot assure you that securities analysts will ever cover our company. As of December 31, 2021, no securities analyst covers our company. If securities analysts do not cover our company, this lack of coverage may adversely affect the trading price of our securities. In the event that securities analysts begin to cover our company, the trading market for our securities will rely in part on the research and reports that such securities analysts publish about us and our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our securities, the trading price of our securities may decline. If one or more of these analysts then ceases to cover our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which, in turn, could also cause the trading price of our securities to decline. Further, because of our small market capitalization, it may be difficult for us to attract securities analysts to cover our company, which could significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our securities.", "PERMNO": 15902, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "LMFA"}
