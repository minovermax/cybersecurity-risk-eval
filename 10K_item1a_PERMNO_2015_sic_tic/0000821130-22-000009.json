Risk Factors\nPRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nSAFE HARBOR CAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including exhibits, contains statements that are not based on historical facts and represent forward-looking statements, as this term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that UScellular intends, expects, projects, believes, estimates, plans or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cprojects\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying them. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, events or developments to be significantly different from any future results, events or developments expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include those set forth below under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Each of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. However, such factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this document. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements. UScellular undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K to understand the material risks relating to UScellular\u2019s business.\nOperational Risk Factors\n1)Intense competition involving products, services, pricing, promotions and network speed and technologies could adversely affect UScellular\u2019s revenues or increase its costs to compete.\nCompetition in the wireless industry is intense and is expected to intensify in the future due to multiple factors such as increasing market penetration, introduction of new products, new competitors, increasing promotional aggressiveness and changing prices. There is competition in service plan pricing; handsets and other devices; promotional discounts; network quality, coverage, speed and technologies, including 5G technology; distribution; new entrants; bundled services and products, such as content; and other categories. In particular, wireless competition includes aggressive service plan and device pricing, including pricing for unlimited plans, which could result in switching activity and churn and limit UScellular's ability to monetize future growth in data usage. In addition, competition based on network speed may increase as customer demand for higher speeds increases. UScellular anticipates that these competitive factors may cause the prices for services and products to decline and the costs to compete to increase.\nUScellular\u2019s primary competitors are national or global telecommunications companies that are larger than UScellular, possess greater financial and other resources, possess more extensive coverage areas and more spectrum within their coverage areas, and market other services with their communications services that UScellular does not offer. UScellular and its competitors are actively marketing their deployment of 5G and, as a result, are raising consumer awareness of the technology. If UScellular cannot keep pace with its competitors in deploying 5G or other comparable offerings, or if UScellular's deployment of 5G technology does not result in significant incremental revenues, UScellular's financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business could be adversely affected. In addition, new technologies, services and products that are more commercially effective than the technologies, services and products offered by UScellular may be developed and create new sources of competition. Further, new technologies may be proprietary such that UScellular is not able to adopt such technologies. There can be no assurance that UScellular will be able to compete successfully in this environment.\nSources of competition to UScellular\u2019s business typically include two to four competing wireless telecommunications service providers in each market, wireline telecommunications service providers, cable companies, resellers (including MVNOs), and providers of alternative telecommunications services. Many of UScellular\u2019s wireless competitors and other competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources than UScellular.\n2)Changes in roaming practices or other factors could cause UScellular's roaming revenues to decline from current levels, roaming expenses to increase from current levels and/or impact UScellular's ability to service its customers in geographic areas where UScellular does not have its own network, which could have an adverse effect on UScellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUScellular\u2019s service revenues include roaming revenues related to the use of UScellular\u2019s network by other carriers\u2019 customers who travel within UScellular\u2019s coverage areas. Changes in FCC rules or actions, industry practices or the network footprints of carriers due to mergers, acquisitions or network expansions could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s roaming revenues. For example, consolidation among other carriers which have network footprints that currently overlap UScellular\u2019s network could decrease the amount of roaming revenues for UScellular.\nSimilarly, UScellular's customers can access another carrier\u2019s network automatically only if the other carrier allows UScellular's customers to roam on its network. UScellular relies on roaming agreements with other carriers to provide roaming capability to its customers in areas of the U.S. and internationally outside of its service areas and to improve coverage within selected areas of UScellular's network footprint. Although UScellular has entered into roaming agreements with national carriers, there is no assurance that UScellular will be able to maintain these agreements and/or enter into new agreements with other carriers to provide roaming services or that it will be able to do so on reasonable or cost-effective terms.\nSome competitors may be able to obtain lower roaming rates than UScellular is able to obtain because they have larger data usage or call volumes or may be able to reduce roaming charges by providing service principally over their own networks. In addition, the quality and availability of services that a wireless carrier delivers to a UScellular customer while roaming may be inferior or limited in comparison to the service UScellular provides. UScellular\u2019s rate of adoption of new technologies, such as those enabling high-speed data and voice services, could affect its ability to enter into or maintain roaming agreements with other carriers. In addition, UScellular\u2019s wireless technology may not be compatible with technologies used by other carriers, which may limit the ability of UScellular to enter into voice or data roaming agreements with such other carriers. Carriers whose customers roam on UScellular\u2019s network could switch their business to new operators, limit their high-speed usage or, over time, move traffic to their own networks. Changes in roaming usage patterns, rates for roaming usage, or roaming relationships with other carriers could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s roaming revenues and/or expenses.\nTo the extent that other carriers expand their networks in UScellular\u2019s service areas, the roaming arrangements between UScellular and these other carriers could become less strategic for them. That is, these other carriers will have fewer or less extensive geographic areas where roaming services are required by their customers and, as a result, the roaming arrangements could become less critical to serving their customer base. This presents a risk to UScellular in that, to the extent UScellular is not able to enter into economically viable roaming arrangements with these other carriers, this could impact UScellular\u2019s ability to service its customers in geographic areas where UScellular does not have its own network.\n3)A failure by UScellular to obtain access to adequate radio spectrum to meet current or anticipated future needs and/or to accurately predict future needs for radio spectrum could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUScellular\u2019s business depends on the ability to use portions of the radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. UScellular could fail to obtain access to sufficient spectrum capacity, including spectrum needed to support 5G technology, in new or existing markets, whether through FCC auctions or other transactions, in order to meet the anticipated spectrum requirements associated with increased demand for existing services, especially increases in customer demand for data services and network speed, and to enable deployment of next-generation services. UScellular believes that this increased demand for data services and network speed reflects a trend that will continue for the foreseeable future. Data usage, including usage under unlimited plans, could exceed current forecasts resulting in a need for increased investment in spectrum or other network components. UScellular could fail to accurately forecast its future spectrum requirements considering changes in plan offerings, customer usage patterns, technology requirements and the expanded demands of new services. Such a failure could have an adverse impact on the quality of UScellular\u2019s services or UScellular\u2019s ability to roll out such future services in some markets, or could require that UScellular curtail existing services in order to make spectrum available for next-generation services. Spectrum constrained providers could be effectively capped in increasing market share. As spectrum constrained providers gain customers, they use up their network capacity. Since they lack spectrum, they can respond to demand only by adding cell sites, which is capital intensive, adds fixed operating costs, is limited by zoning considerations, and ultimately may not be cost effective. Further, a spectrum constrained provider will generally not be able to achieve the data speeds that other competitors with more spectrum are able to provide.\nUScellular may acquire access to spectrum through a number of alternatives, including acquisitions, exchanges and participation in spectrum auctions. UScellular may participate in spectrum auctions conducted by the FCC in the future. As required by law, the FCC has conducted auctions for wireless spectrum licenses to use some parts of the radio spectrum. The decision to conduct auctions, and the determination of what spectrum frequencies will be made available for auction and the determination of geographic size of wireless spectrum licenses, are made by the FCC pursuant to laws that it administers. The FCC may not be able to allocate spectrum sufficient to meet the demands of all those wishing to obtain wireless spectrum licenses for new market entry or to expand their spectrum holdings to meet the expanding demand for data services or to address other spectrum constraints. Due to factors such as geographic size of wireless spectrum licenses and auction bidders that may raise prices beyond acceptable levels, UScellular may not be successful in FCC auctions in obtaining access to the spectrum that it believes is necessary to implement its business and technology strategies.\nAccess to wireless spectrum licenses won in FCC auctions may not be available on a timely basis. Such access is dependent upon the FCC actually granting wireless spectrum licenses won, which can be rescinded or delayed for various reasons, including but not limited to exceeding spectrum ownership and attribution limits, and safety concerns due to interference with other spectrum bands. Furthermore, newly licensed spectrum may not be available for immediate use since the radio operations of incumbent users, including in some cases government agencies, may need to be relocated to other portions of the radio spectrum, and/or the newly licensed spectrum may be subject to sharing and coordination obligations. UScellular also may seek to acquire radio spectrum through purchases and exchanges with other spectrum licensees. However, UScellular may not be able to acquire sufficient spectrum through these types of transactions, and UScellular may not be able to complete any of these transactions on favorable terms.\n4)An inability to attract people of outstanding talent throughout all levels of the organization, to develop their potential through education and assignments, and to retain them by keeping them engaged, challenged and properly rewarded could have an adverse effect on UScellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUScellular\u2019s business is highly technical and competition for skilled talent in the wireless industry is intense. Due to competition, limited supply, and/or rising wage levels for qualified management, technical, sales and other personnel, there can be no assurance that UScellular will be able to continue to attract and/or retain people of outstanding potential for the development of its business. In addition, transitioning to a new remote or hybrid working model and applicability of health protocols such as vaccination requirements could negatively affect talent acquisition and retention. The loss of existing key personnel due to competition, wage levels and/or retirements, the failure to recruit additional qualified personnel in a timely and cost-effective manner, the inability to foster and maintain a diverse and inclusive work environment, or failure to maintain its commitment to environmental and social responsibility could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe market for highly skilled leaders in the wireless industry also is extremely competitive. The future success of UScellular and its business depends in substantial part on UScellular\u2019s ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly skilled leaders for all areas of its organization. The loss of any of UScellular\u2019s key leaders could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. Effective succession planning is also important to UScellular\u2019s long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving key employees could also adversely affect UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n5)UScellular\u2019s smaller scale relative to larger competitors that may have greater financial and other resources than UScellular could cause UScellular to be unable to compete successfully, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere has been a trend in the telecommunications and related industries towards consolidation of service providers through acquisitions, reorganizations and joint ventures. This trend could continue, leading to larger competitors over time. UScellular has smaller scale efficiencies compared to larger competitors. UScellular may be unable to compete successfully with larger companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources or that offer more services than UScellular, which could adversely affect UScellular\u2019s revenues and costs of doing business. Specifically, UScellular\u2019s smaller scale relative to most of its competitors could have the following impacts, among others:\n\u25aaLow profit margins and returns on investment that are below UScellular\u2019s cost of capital;\n\u25aaIncreased operating costs due to lack of leverage with vendors;\n\u25aaInability to timely and successfully deploy 5G or other wireless technologies, or to realize significant incremental revenues from their deployment;\n\u25aaLimited opportunities for strategic partnerships as potential partners are focused on wireless companies with greater scale and scope;\n\u25aaLimited access to content, as well as limited ability to obtain acceptably priced content;\n\u25aaConsumer expectations that UScellular provides lower-priced offerings relative to larger competitors;\n\u25aaLimited ability to influence industry standards;\n\u25aaReduced ability to invest in research and development of new services and products;\n\u25aaLower risk tolerance when evaluating new markets;\n\u25aaVendors may deem UScellular non-strategic and not develop or sell services and products to UScellular, particularly where technical requirements differ from those of larger companies;\n\u25aaLimited access to intellectual property; and\n\u25aaOther limited opportunities such as for software development or third party distribution.\nUScellular\u2019s business depends on access to content for data and access to new wireless devices being developed by vendors. UScellular\u2019s ability to obtain such access depends in part on other parties. If UScellular is unable to obtain timely access to new content or wireless devices being developed by vendors, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n6)Changes in various business factors, including changes in demand, consumer preferences and perceptions, price competition, churn from customer switching activity and other factors, could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in any of several factors could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aaDemand for or usage of services, particularly data services;\n\u25aaConsumer preferences, including type of wireless devices;\n\u25aaConsumer perceptions of network quality and performance;\n\u25aaConsumer expectations for self-service options through digital means;\n\u25aaCompetitive pressure to deliver higher speed;\n\u25aaCompetitive pressure from promotional activity;\n\u25aaThe pricing of services, including an increase in price-based competition;\n\u25aaInflationary pressures on costs without corresponding price increases for UScellular's services;\n\u25aaThe overall size and growth rate of UScellular\u2019s customer base;\n\u25aaPenetration rates;\n\u25aaChurn rates;\n\u25aaSelling expenses;\n\u25aaNet customer acquisition and retention costs;\n\u25aaCustomers\u2019 ability to pay for wireless service and the potential impact on bad debts expense;\n\u25aaRoaming agreements and rates;\n\u25aaThird-party vendor support;\n\u25aaCapacity constraints;\n\u25aaThe mix of services and products offered by UScellular and purchased by customers; and\n\u25aaThe costs of providing services and products.\n7)Advances or changes in technology could render certain technologies used by UScellular obsolete, could put UScellular at a competitive disadvantage, could reduce UScellular\u2019s revenues or could increase its costs of doing business.\nThe telecommunications industry is experiencing significant changes in technologies and services expected by customers, as evidenced by evolving industry standards, ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter development cycles for new services and products, and enhancements and changes in end-user requirements and preferences. Further, fixed-mobile convergence services that combine wireline broadband services with mobile services represent a competitive threat. If the trend toward convergence continues, UScellular is at a competitive disadvantage to larger competitors, including the national wireless carriers and other potential large new entrants with much greater financial and other resources in adapting to such convergence. Future technological changes or advancements may enable other wireless technologies to equal or exceed UScellular\u2019s current levels of service and render its system infrastructure obsolete. UScellular may not be able to respond to such changes and implement new technology on a timely or cost-effective basis, which could reduce its revenues or increase its costs of doing business.\n8)Complexities associated with deploying new technologies present substantial risk and UScellular investments in unproven technologies may not produce the benefits that UScellular expects.\nUScellular is deploying 5G technology in its network and has launched commercial 5G services in portions of substantially all of its markets. The continued deployment of 5G technology will require substantial investments in UScellular's wireless networks to remain competitive in the industry. Transition to 5G or other new technologies involves significant time, cost and risk, and anticipated products and revenues may not be realized. Furthermore, the wireless business experiences rapid technology changes and new services and products. If UScellular fails to effectively deploy new wireless technologies, services or products on a timely basis, this could have an adverse impact on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, it is not certain that UScellular\u2019s investments in various new, unproven technologies and the related service and product offerings will be effective. The markets for some of these services, products and solutions may still be emerging and the overall potential for these markets, including revenues to be realized, may be uncertain. If customer demand for these new services, products and solutions does not develop as expected, UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n9)Costs, integration problems or other factors associated with acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges of properties or wireless spectrum licenses and/or expansion of UScellular\u2019s business could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs part of UScellular\u2019s operating strategy, UScellular from time to time may be engaged in the acquisition, divestiture or exchange of companies, businesses, strategic properties, wireless spectrum or other assets. UScellular may change the markets in which it operates and the services that it provides through such acquisitions, divestitures and/or exchanges. In general, UScellular may not disclose the negotiation of such transactions until a definitive agreement has been reached.\nThese transactions commonly involve a number of risks, including:\n\u25aaIdentification of attractive companies, businesses, properties, spectrum or other assets for acquisition or exchange, and/or the selection of UScellular\u2019s businesses or assets for divestiture or exchange;\n\u25aaCompetition for acquisition targets and the ability to acquire or exchange businesses at reasonable prices;\n\u25aaInability to make acquisitions that would achieve sufficient scale to be competitive with competitors with greater scale;\n\u25aaPossible lack of buyers for businesses or assets that UScellular desires to divest and the ability to divest or exchange such businesses or assets at reasonable prices;\n\u25aaAbility to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u25aaSignificant expenditures associated with acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u25aaRisks associated with integrating new businesses or markets, including risks relating to cybersecurity and privacy;\n\u25aaAbility to enter markets in which UScellular has limited or no direct prior experience and competitors have stronger positions;\n\u25aaAbility to integrate and manage businesses that are engaged in activities other than traditional wireless service;\n\u25aaUncertain revenues and expenses associated with acquisitions, with the result that UScellular may not realize the growth in revenues, anticipated cost structure, profitability, or return on investment that it expects;\n\u25aaDifficulty of integrating the technologies, services, products, operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, or of separating such matters for divested businesses or assets;\n\u25aaDiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25aaDisruption of ongoing business;\n\u25aaImpact on UScellular\u2019s cash and available credit lines for use in financing future growth and working capital needs;\n\u25aaInability to retain key personnel;\n\u25aaInability to successfully incorporate acquired assets and rights into UScellular\u2019s service offerings;\n\u25aaInability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25aaPossible conditions to approval by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Department of Justice; and\n\u25aaImpairment of relationships with employees, customers or vendors.\nNo assurance can be given that UScellular will be successful with respect to its acquisition, divestiture or exchange strategies or initiatives.\n10)A failure by UScellular to complete significant network construction and systems implementation activities as part of its plans to improve the quality, coverage, capabilities and capacity of its network, support and other systems and infrastructure could have an adverse effect on its operations.\nUScellular\u2019s business plan includes significant construction activities and enhancements to its network, support and other systems and infrastructure. Additionally, the deployment of new wireless technologies, including 5G, may require substantial investments in UScellular's wireless network. As UScellular deploys, expands and enhances its network, it may need to acquire additional spectrum. Also, as UScellular continues to build out and enhance its network, UScellular must, among other things, continue to:\n\u25aaLease, acquire or otherwise obtain rights to cell and switch sites;\n\u25aaObtain zoning variances or other local governmental or third-party approvals or permits for network construction;\n\u25aaComplete and update the radio frequency design, including cell site design, frequency planning and network optimization, for each of UScellular\u2019s markets; and\n\u25aaImprove, expand and maintain customer care, network management, billing and other financial and management systems.\nAny difficulties encountered in completing these activities, as well as problems in vendor equipment availability, labor availability, inflation or other pressures on costs, technical resources, system performance or system adequacy, could delay implementation and deployment of new technologies, delay expansion of operations and product capabilities in new or existing markets or result in increased costs. Failure to successfully deploy new technologies, including 5G, and/or build-out and enhance UScellular\u2019s network, support facilities and other systems and infrastructure in a cost-effective manner, and in a manner that satisfies consumers' expectations for quality and coverage, could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\n11)Difficulties involving third parties with which UScellular does business, including changes in UScellular's relationships with or financial or operational difficulties, including supply chain disruptions, of key suppliers or independent agents and third-party national retailers who market UScellular\u2019s services, could adversely affect UScellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUScellular has relationships with independent agents and third-party national retailers who market UScellular services.\nUScellular depends upon certain vendors to provide it with equipment, services and content that meet its quality and cost requirements on a timely basis to continue its network construction and upgrades, and to operate its business. UScellular depends upon certain vendors to provide it with wireless devices that meet its quality and cost requirements on a timely basis to support sales. UScellular does not have operational or financial control over such key suppliers and has limited influence with respect to the manner in which these key suppliers conduct their businesses. Further, key suppliers may experience supply chain challenges beyond their control that result in difficulties providing the services and products typically requested by UScellular on a timely basis. If these key suppliers (i) experience product availability shortages, (ii) require extended lead times to fulfill orders, (iii) experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy or experience other operational difficulties or (iv) deem UScellular non-strategic and not develop or sell services and products to UScellular, particularly where technical requirements differ from those of larger companies, they may not provide equipment, services or content to UScellular on a timely basis, or at all, or they may otherwise fail to honor their obligations to UScellular. Furthermore, consolidation among key suppliers may result in less competition, higher prices, the discontinuation of equipment and/or services typically purchased by UScellular or the discontinuation of support for equipment owned by UScellular.\nOperation of UScellular\u2019s supply chain and management of its device inventory and network equipment require accurate forecasting of customer growth and demand. If overall demand for wireless devices or the mix of demand for wireless devices is significantly different than UScellular\u2019s expectations, UScellular could face inadequate or excess supplies of particular models of wireless devices. This could result in lost sales opportunities or an excess supply of device inventory. If network equipment is not available or requires extended lead times due to supply chain challenges, or if overall demand for wireless services or the mix of demand for wireless services is significantly different than UScellular\u2019s expectations, UScellular may not be able to adequately maintain a network that supports customer demand. Further, UScellular's supply chain could be disrupted unexpectedly by raw material shortages, wars, natural disasters, disease or other factors. Supply chain disruptions may result in limited component availability, constraints on certain devices, extended lead times, delayed construction and additional uncertainty.\nAlso, UScellular has other arrangements with third parties, including arrangements pursuant to which UScellular outsources certain support functions to third-party vendors. Operational problems associated with such functions, including any failure by the vendor to provide the required level of service under the outsourcing arrangements, including possible cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security, data protection or privacy, could have adverse effects on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n12)A failure by UScellular to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technologies, or a material disruption thereof, could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUScellular relies extensively on its telecommunication networks and information technologies to operate and manage its business, process transactions and summarize and report results. These networks and technologies are subject to obsolescence and, consequently, must be upgraded, replaced and/or otherwise enhanced over time. Enhancements must be more flexible and dependable than ever before. All of this is capital intensive and challenging.\nThe increased provision of data services has introduced significant demands on UScellular\u2019s network and also has increased complexities related to network management. Further, the increased provision of data services on UScellular\u2019s networks has created an increased level of risk related to quality of service and data speeds. This is due to the fact that many customers increasingly rely on data communications to execute and validate transactions. As a result, redundancy and geographical diversity of UScellular\u2019s network facilities are critical to providing uninterrupted service. Also, the speed of repair and maintenance procedures in the event of network interruptions is critical to maintaining customer satisfaction. UScellular\u2019s ability to maintain high-quality, uninterrupted service to its customers is critical, particularly given the increasingly competitive environment and customers\u2019 ability to choose other service providers.\nIn addition, UScellular\u2019s networks and information technologies and the networks and information technologies of vendors on which UScellular relies are subject to damage or interruption due to various events, including power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, hackers and other cyber security risks, catastrophic events, natural disasters, severe weather, adverse climate changes, errors or unauthorized actions by employees and vendors, flawed conversion of systems, disruptive technologies and technology changes.\nFinancial Risk Factors\n13)Uncertainty in UScellular\u2019s future cash flow and liquidity or the inability to access capital, deterioration in the capital markets, changes in interest rates, other changes in UScellular\u2019s performance or market conditions, changes in UScellular\u2019s credit ratings or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to UScellular, which could require UScellular to reduce its construction, development or acquisition programs, reduce the amount of wireless spectrum licenses acquired, and/or reduce or cease share repurchases.\nUScellular operates a capital-intensive business. Historically, UScellular has used internally-generated funds and also has obtained substantial funds from external sources for general corporate purposes. In the past, UScellular\u2019s existing cash and investment balances, funds available under its revolving credit and receivables securitization agreements, funds from other financing sources, including term loans and other long-term debt, and cash flows from operating and certain investing and financing activities, including sales of assets or businesses, provided sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility for UScellular to meet its normal day-to-day operating needs and debt service requirements, to finance the build-out and enhancement of markets and to fund acquisitions. There is no assurance that this will be the case in the future. It may be necessary from time to time to increase the amount of permissible borrowings under the existing revolving credit and receivables securitization agreements, to put in place new credit agreements, or to obtain other forms of financing in order to fund potential expenditures. UScellular\u2019s liquidity would be adversely affected if, among other things, UScellular is unable to obtain short or long-term financing on acceptable terms, interest rates increase, UScellular makes significant spectrum license purchases, UScellular makes significant capital investments, UScellular makes significant business acquisitions, the Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership (LA Partnership) discontinues or significantly reduces distributions compared to historical levels, or Federal USF and/or other regulatory support payments decline.\nUScellular\u2019s credit rating currently is sub-investment grade. UScellular has incurred negative free cash flow (defined as Cash flows from operating activities less Cash paid for additions to property, plant and equipment) at times in the past and this could occur in the future. UScellular may require substantial additional capital for, among other uses, funding day-to-day operating needs including working capital, acquisitions of providers of wireless telecommunications services, spectrum license or system acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, the repurchase of shares, or making additional investments. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will continue to be available to UScellular or its subsidiaries on terms or at prices acceptable to UScellular. Insufficient cash flows from operating activities, changes in UScellular's credit ratings, defaults of the terms of debt or credit agreements, uncertainty of access to capital, deterioration in the capital markets, reduced regulatory capital at banks which in turn limits their ability to borrow and lend, other changes in the performance of UScellular or in market conditions or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to UScellular, which could require UScellular to reduce its acquisition, capital expenditure and business development programs, reduce the acquisition of wireless spectrum licenses, and/or reduce or cease share repurchases. UScellular cannot provide assurance that circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or capital resources will not occur.\n14)UScellular has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial performance and in turn adversely affect its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, comply with terms of debt covenants and incur additional debt.\nUScellular has a significant amount of indebtedness and may need to incur additional indebtedness. UScellular\u2019s level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it (i) may limit UScellular\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to its debt securities by rating organizations are revised downward; (ii) will require UScellular to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on its debt, thereby reducing the funds available to UScellular for other purposes including expansion through acquisitions, capital expenditures, acquisition of wireless spectrum licenses, marketing spending and expansion of its business; and (iii) may limit UScellular\u2019s flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and make UScellular more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions as compared to UScellular\u2019s competitors. UScellular\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on its indebtedness or to refinance it will depend on its financial and operating performance which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and other factors beyond its control.\nUScellular\u2019s revolving credit agreement, term loan agreement and receivables securitization agreement require UScellular to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial covenants. Depending on the actual financial performance of UScellular, there is a risk that UScellular could fail to satisfy the required financial covenants. If UScellular breaches a financial or other covenant of any of these agreements, it would result in a default under that agreement, and could involve a cross-default under other debt instruments. This could in turn cause the affected lenders to accelerate the repayment of principal and accrued interest on any outstanding debt under such agreements and, if they choose, terminate the agreement. If appropriate, UScellular may request an amendment to one or more credit agreements to adjust financial covenants in order to provide additional financial flexibility to UScellular, and may also seek other changes to such agreements. There is no assurance that the lenders will agree to any amendments. If the lenders agree to amendments, this may result in additional payments or higher interest rates payable to the lenders and/or additional restrictions. Restrictions in such debt instruments may limit UScellular\u2019s operating and financial flexibility.\nAs a result, UScellular\u2019s level of indebtedness, restrictions contained in debt instruments and/or possible breaches of covenants, defaults, and acceleration of indebtedness could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\n15)UScellular\u2019s assets and revenue are concentrated in the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry. Consequently, its operating results may fluctuate based on factors related primarily to conditions in this industry.\nThe U.S. wireless telecommunications industry is facing significant change and an uncertain operating environment. UScellular\u2019s focus on the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry, together with its positioning relative to larger competitors with greater resources within the industry, may represent increased risk for investors due to the lack of diversification. This could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s ability to attain and sustain long-term, profitable revenue growth and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\n16)UScellular has significant investments in entities that it does not control. Losses in the value of such investments could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nUScellular has significant investments in entities that it does not control, including equity investments and interests in certain variable interest entities. UScellular\u2019s interests in such entities do not provide UScellular with control over the business strategy, financial goals, network build-out plans or other operational aspects of these entities. UScellular cannot provide assurance that these entities will operate in a manner that will increase or maintain the value of UScellular\u2019s investments, that UScellular\u2019s proportionate share of income from these investments will continue at the current level in the future or that UScellular will not incur losses from the holding of such investments. Losses in the values of such investments or a reduction in income from these investments could adversely affect UScellular\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. In addition, certain investments have historically contributed significant cash flows to UScellular and a reduction or suspension of such cash flows could adversely affect UScellular\u2019s financial condition.\nRegulatory, Legal and Governance Risk Factors\n17)Failure by UScellular to timely or fully comply with any existing applicable legislative and/or regulatory requirements or changes thereto could adversely affect UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUScellular\u2019s operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FCC, state public utility commissions and other federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. Changes in the administration of the various regulatory agencies and legislative bodies could result in different policies with respect to many federal laws and regulations, including but not limited to changes to fiscal and tax policies, trade policies, tariffs on import goods and climate change. New or amended regulatory requirements could increase UScellular\u2019s costs and divert resources from other initiatives. Adverse decisions, increased regulation, or changes to existing regulation by regulatory bodies could negatively impact UScellular\u2019s operations by, among other things, restricting energy consumption or access to grid electricity, permitting greater competition or limiting UScellular\u2019s ability to engage in certain sales or marketing activities, or retention and recruitment of skilled resources. New regulatory mandates or enforcement may require unexpected or increased capital expenditures, lost revenues, higher operating expenses or other changes. Court decisions and rulemakings could have a substantial impact on UScellular\u2019s operations, including rulemakings on broadband access to the internet, intercarrier access compensation and state and federal support funding. Litigation and different objectives among federal and state regulators could create uncertainty and delay UScellular\u2019s ability to respond to new regulations. Further, wireless spectrum licenses are subject to renewal by the FCC and could be revoked in the event of a violation of applicable laws or regulatory requirements. Also, although FCC rules relating to net neutrality have been repealed, the FCC and federal and state legislators may seek to reinstate net neutrality in some form and state legislators and regulators are seeking to or have already enacted state net neutrality laws and regulations. Interpretation and application of these rules, including conflicts between federal and state laws, may result in additional costs for compliance and may limit opportunities to derive profits from certain business practices or resources.\nUScellular attempts to timely and fully comply with all regulatory requirements. However, UScellular is unable to predict the future actions of the various legislative and regulatory bodies that govern UScellular, and such actions could have adverse effects on UScellular\u2019s business.\n18)UScellular receives significant regulatory support, and is also subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments - the applicability and the amount of the support and fees are subject to great uncertainty, including the ability to pass through certain fees to customers, and this uncertainty could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTelecommunications companies may be designated by states, or in some cases by the FCC, as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) to receive universal service support payments if they provide specified services in \u201chigh cost\u201d areas. UScellular has been designated as an ETC in certain states and received $92 million in high cost support for service to high cost areas in 2021. There is no assurance that regulatory support payments will continue, and no assurance that UScellular will qualify for future regulatory support programs. If regulatory support is discontinued or reduced from current levels, or if receipt of future regulatory support is contingent upon making certain network-related expenditures, this could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results.\nTelecommunications providers pay a variety of surcharges and fees on their gross revenues from interstate and intrastate services, including USF fees and common carrier regulatory fees. The division of services between interstate services and intrastate services, including the divisions associated with Federal USF fees, is a matter of interpretation and in the future may be contested by the FCC or state authorities. The FCC in the future also may change the basis on which Federal USF fees are charged. The Federal government and many states also apply transaction-based taxes to sales of telecommunications services and products and to purchases of telecommunications services from various carriers. In addition, state regulators and local governments have imposed and may continue to impose various surcharges, taxes and fees on telecommunications services. The applicability of these surcharges and fees to UScellular\u2019s services is uncertain in many cases and jurisdictions may contest whether UScellular has assessed and remitted those monies correctly. Periodically, state and federal regulators may increase or change the surcharges and fees UScellular currently pays. In some instances, UScellular passes through these charges to its customers. However, Congress, the FCC, state regulatory agencies or state legislatures may limit the ability to pass through transaction-based tax liabilities, regulatory surcharges and regulatory fees imposed on UScellular to customers. UScellular may or may not be able to recover some or all of those taxes from its customers and the amount of taxes may deter demand for its services or increase its cost to provide service.\n19)Settlements, judgments, restraints on its current or future manner of doing business and/or legal costs resulting from pending and future litigation could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUScellular is regularly involved in a number of legal and policy proceedings before the FCC and various state and federal courts. Such legal and policy proceedings can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel.\nThe assessment of legal and policy proceedings is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events. Additionally, amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or resolution of litigation and other contingencies may differ materially from amounts accrued in the financial statements. Depending on a range of factors, these or similar proceedings could impose restraints on UScellular\u2019s current or future manner of doing business.\n20)The possible development of adverse precedent in litigation or conclusions in professional studies to the effect that radio frequency emissions from wireless devices and/or cell sites cause harmful health consequences, including cancer or tumors, or may interfere with various electronic medical devices or frequencies used by other industries, could have an adverse effect on UScellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMedia reports and certain professional studies have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless devices may be linked to various health problems, including cancer or tumors, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. There may also be safety concerns related to frequencies used by wireless devices interfering with frequencies used by other industries, including but not limited to, the recent concerns of the Federal Aviation Administration regarding potential interference of 5G deployment with altimeters used by aircraft, which could impact deployment of certain wireless spectrum. UScellular is a party to and may in the future be a party to lawsuits against wireless carriers and other parties claiming damages for alleged health effects, including cancer or tumors, arising from wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may discourage use of wireless devices or expose UScellular to potential litigation. In addition, the FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt regulations in response to concerns about radio frequency emissions. Any resulting decrease in demand for wireless services, costs of litigation and damage awards or regulation could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, some studies have indicated that some aspects of using a wireless device while driving may impair a driver's attention in certain circumstances, making accidents more likely. These concerns could lead to potential litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries.\n21)Claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, primarily involving patent infringement claims, could prevent UScellular from using necessary technology to provide products or services or subject UScellular to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUScellular faces possible effects of industry litigation relating to patents, other intellectual property or otherwise, that may restrict UScellular\u2019s access to devices or network equipment critical to providing services to customers. If technology that UScellular uses in products or services were determined by a court to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another person, UScellular could be precluded from using that technology and could be required to pay significant monetary damages. UScellular also may be required to pay significant royalties to such person to continue to use such technology in the future. The successful enforcement of any intellectual property rights, or UScellular\u2019s inability to negotiate a license for such rights on acceptable terms, could force UScellular to cease using the relevant technology and offering services incorporating the technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that UScellular\u2019s products or services infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the effort and attention of UScellular\u2019s management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, UScellular cannot give assurance that it would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. Although UScellular generally seeks to obtain indemnification agreements from vendors that provide it with technology, there can be no assurance that any claim of infringement will be covered by an indemnity or that UScellular will be able to recover all or any of its losses and costs under any available indemnity agreements. Any claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent UScellular from using necessary technology to provide its services or subject UScellular to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties.\n22)There are potential conflicts of interests between TDS and UScellular.\nTDS owns over 80% of the combined total of both classes of common stock of UScellular, including a majority of the outstanding Common Shares and 100% of the Series A Common Shares, and controls 96% of their combined voting power. As a result, TDS is effectively able to elect all of UScellular\u2019s eleven directors and otherwise control the management and operations of UScellular. Six of the eleven directors of UScellular are also directors of TDS and/or executive officers of TDS and/or UScellular. Directors and officers of TDS who are also directors or officers of UScellular, and TDS as UScellular\u2019s controlling shareholder, are in positions involving the possibility of conflicts of interest with respect to certain transactions concerning UScellular. When the interests of TDS and UScellular diverge, TDS may exercise its influence in its own best interests.\nUScellular and TDS have entered into contractual arrangements governing certain transactions and relationships between them. Some of these agreements were executed prior to the initial public offering of UScellular\u2019s Common Shares and were not the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the terms and conditions of these agreements are as favorable to UScellular as could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nConflicts of interest may arise between TDS and UScellular when faced with decisions that could have different implications for UScellular and TDS, including technology decisions, financial decisions, the payment of distributions by UScellular, agreements or transactions between TDS and UScellular, business activities and other matters. TDS also may take action that favors its other businesses and the interests of its shareholders over UScellular\u2019s wireless business and the interests of UScellular shareholders and debt holders. Because TDS controls UScellular, conflicts of interest could be resolved in a manner adverse to UScellular and its other shareholders or its debt holders.\nThe UScellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, so long as not less than 500,000 Series A Common Shares are outstanding, UScellular, without the written consent of TDS, shall not, directly or indirectly own, invest or otherwise have an interest in, lease, operate or manage any business other than a business engaged solely in the construction of, the ownership of interests in and/or the management of wireless telephone systems. This limitation on the scope of UScellular\u2019s potential business could hurt the growth of UScellular\u2019s business. This restriction would preclude UScellular from pursuing attractive related or unrelated business opportunities unless TDS consents in writing. TDS has no obligation to consent to any business opportunities proposed by UScellular and may withhold its consent in its own best interests.\n23)Certain matters, such as control by TDS and provisions in the UScellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation, may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of UScellular or have other consequences.\nThe control of UScellular by TDS may tend to deter non-negotiated tender offers or other efforts to obtain control of UScellular and thereby deprive shareholders of opportunities to sell shares at prices higher than those prevailing in the market.\nThe UScellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation also contains provisions which may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of UScellular without the support of TDS or without meeting various other conditions. In particular, the authorization of multiple classes of capital stock with different voting rights could prevent shareholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change in control of UScellular by delaying or preventing such change in control.\nThe UScellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation also authorizes the UScellular Board of Directors to designate and issue Preferred Shares in one or more classes or series from time to time. Generally, no further action or authorization by the shareholders is necessary prior to the designation or issuance of the additional Preferred Shares authorized pursuant to the UScellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless applicable laws or regulations would require such approval in a given instance. Such Preferred Shares could be issued in circumstances that would serve to preserve TDS\u2019 control of UScellular.\nThe provisions of the UScellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the existence of different classes of capital stock and voting rights could result in the exclusion of UScellular Common Shares from certain major stock indices at some point in the future, unless UScellular is grandfathered by such stock indices or qualifies for some other exception.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n24)UScellular has experienced, and in the future expects to experience, cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security of varying degrees on a regular basis, which could have an adverse effect on UScellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUScellular experiences cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. These include cyber-attacks intended to wrongfully obtain private and valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events, including denial of service attacks which may cause UScellular's services to be disrupted or unavailable to customers. The increasing number of associates working remotely increases risks associated with data handling and vulnerability management. UScellular maintains administrative, technical and physical controls, as well as other preventative actions, to reduce the risk of security breaches. Although to date UScellular has not discovered a material security breach, these efforts may be insufficient to prevent a material security breach stemming from future cyber-attacks. If UScellular\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 networks and information technology are not adequately adapted to changes in technology or are damaged or fail to function properly, and/or if UScellular\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 security is breached or otherwise compromised, UScellular could suffer adverse consequences, including theft, destruction or other loss of critical and private data, including customer and/or employee data, interruptions or delays in its operations, inaccurate billings, inaccurate financial reporting, and significant costs to remedy the problems. If UScellular\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems become unavailable or suffer a security breach of customer or other data, UScellular may be required to expend significant resources and take various actions to address the problems, including notification under data privacy laws and regulations, may be subject to fines, sanctions and litigation, and its reputation and operating results could be adversely affected. UScellular continues to experience denial of service attacks. Although UScellular has implemented and continues to enhance its protection and recovery measures in response to such attacks, these efforts may be insufficient to prevent a material denial of service attack in the future.\n25)Disruption in credit or other financial markets, a deterioration of U.S. or global economic conditions or other events could, among other things, impede UScellular\u2019s access to or increase the cost of financing its operating and investment activities and/or result in reduced revenues and lower operating income and cash flows, which would have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDisruptions in the credit and financial markets, declines in consumer confidence, increases in unemployment, declines in economic growth, increased tariffs on import goods, sudden increases in inflation and uncertainty about corporate earnings could have a significant negative impact on the U.S. and global financial and credit markets and the overall economy. Such events could have an adverse impact on financial institutions resulting in limited access to capital and credit for many companies. Furthermore, economic uncertainties make it very difficult to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Changes in economic conditions, changes in financial markets, changes in U.S. trade policies, deterioration in the capital markets or other factors could have an adverse effect on UScellular\u2019s business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\n26)The impact of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on UScellular's business is uncertain, but depending on duration and severity could have a material adverse effect on UScellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPublic health emergencies, such as COVID-19, pose the risk that UScellular or its associates, agents, partners and suppliers may be unable to conduct business activities for an extended period of time and/or provide the level of service expected. UScellular's ability to attract customers, maintain an adequate supply chain and execute on its business strategies and initiatives could be negatively impacted by public health emergencies. Additionally, public health emergencies could cause increased unemployment and an economic downturn, both of which could negatively impact UScellular. The extent of the impact of public health emergencies on UScellular's business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on the severity and duration of the emergency, actions taken by governmental authorities and other possible direct and indirect consequences, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.", "PERMNO": 75320, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "USM"}
