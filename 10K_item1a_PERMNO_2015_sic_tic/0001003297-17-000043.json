{"cik": "64463", "company": "MECHANICAL TECHNOLOGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nFactors Affecting Future Results\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Any statements contained, or incorporated by reference, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. When we use the words \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201ccontinuing,\u201d \u201congoing,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cmanagement believes,\u201d \u201cwe believe,\u201d \u201cwe intend,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill\u201d and similar words or phrases, we are identifying forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding:\nanticipated growth, including in revenues and cash flows;\nstatements with respect to management\u2019s strategy and planned initiatives;\nmanagement\u2019s belief that it will have adequate resources to fund the Company\u2019s operations and capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2017 and through the end of the first quarter of 2018;\nthe expected impact of recent and pending accounting standards or updates;\nprojected taxable income and the ability to use deferred tax assets (currently held at a full valuation allowance);\ngenerating earnings in the future;\nthe expectation that future cost-cutting measures will be avoided;\nfuture capital expenditures and spending on research and development;\nexpected funding of future cash expenditures; and\nthe expected impact of our investment in MeOH Power, Inc.\nForward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause these differences include the following:\nstatements with respect to management\u2019s strategy and planned initiatives;\nsales revenue growth may not be achieved or maintained;\nthe dependence of our business on a small number of customers and potential loss of government contracts - particularly in light of potential cuts that may be imposed as a result of U.S. government budget appropriations;\nour lack of long-term purchase commitments from our customers and the ability of our customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders for our products;\nour inability to build and maintain relationships with our customers;\nour inability to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers;\nour inability to obtain new credit facilities;\nthe cyclical nature of the electronics and military industries;\nthe uncertainty of the U.S. and global economy, including as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s impending exit from the European Union;\nthe impact of future exchange rate fluctuations;\nfailure of our strategic alliances to achieve their objectives or perform as contemplated and the risk of cancellation or early termination of such alliance by either party;\nthe loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to hire, train, and retain key personnel;\nrisks related to protection and infringement of intellectual property;\nour occasional dependence on sole suppliers or a limited group of suppliers;\nour ability to generate income to realize the tax benefit of our historical net operating losses;\nrisks related to the limitation of the use, for tax purposes, of our net historical operating losses in the event of certain ownership changes; and\nother risks discussed below.\nExcept as may be required by applicable law, we do not undertake or intend to update or revise our forward-looking statements, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a result of new information or future events or developments. Thus, assumptions should not be made that our silence over time means that actual events are bearing out as expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements.\nRisk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risks, along with other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that may affect us. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations including those discussed in the heading \u201cFactors Affecting Future Results\u201d above. Any of the following events, should they actually occur, could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges, we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future, our business and results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited.\nWe have incurred significant operating and net losses since our inception. We incurred a net loss of $359 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016 and had an accumulated deficit of $121.0 million as of such date. In order to achieve and maintain profitability and improve liquidity, we must successfully achieve all or some combination of the following initiatives: increasing sales, developing new products, controlling operating expenses, managing our cash flows, successfully obtaining new credit facilities, improving operational efficiency and estimating and projecting accurately our liquidity and capital resources. In \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Management\u2019s Plan, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we made estimates regarding our cash flow and results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2017 and through the end of the first quarter of 2018. If our cash flow or results of operations are less favorable than we have estimated, we may not be able to make all of our planned operating or capital expenditures or fully execute all of our other plans. Our financial success depends in part on management\u2019s ability to execute our growth strategy. We expect that we will depend primarily on cash generated by our operations for funds to pay our expenses and any other indebtedness we may incur. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and our currently anticipated growth in revenues and cash flows may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have enough money, we may be required to sell assets or borrow money, in each case on terms that may not be acceptable to us. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements, including new lines of credit, may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. Further, any significant levels of indebtedness in the future could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have access to additional resources or proportionately less debt and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Any future loss incurred by the Company could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to generate the cash needed to operate our business. Although we generated net income in 2011, 2013 and 2014, we had a net loss during 2016 and 2015 and prior to 2011 we had generated net losses since 1998, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. If we do achieve profitability in the future, the level of any profitability cannot be predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. Failure to continue to successfully implement these initiatives could prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business plans, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition and may result in a downsize to the business. Further, even if implemented successfully there is no guarantee that our efforts in this regard would result in sustained and improving profitability.\nWe currently derive all of our product revenue from our MTI Instruments business.\nAll of our revenue is currently derived from our MTI Instruments business. We do not have a broad portfolio of other products we could rely on to support operations if we were to experience a substantial slowdown in our MTI Instruments business, which is subject to a number of risks, including:\ndependence on a limited number of customers;\na continued slowdown or cancellation of sales to the military as a result of a potential redeployment, or sequestration, of governmental funding;\nour ability to maintain, improve, or expand our channels of distribution;\nthe potential failure to expand or maintain our business as a result of competition, a lack of brand awareness, or market saturation; and\nan inability to launch new products as a result of intense competition, uncertainty of new technology development, or limited or unavailable resources to fund development.\nIn addition, revenues from the sale of MTI Instruments\u2019 products can vary significantly from one period to the next. We may sell a significant amount of our products to one or a few customers for various short term projects in one period, and then have markedly decreased sales in following periods as these projects end or customers have the products they require for the foreseeable future. The fact that we sell a significant amount of our products to a limited number of customers also results in a customer concentration risk. The loss of any significant portion of such customers or a material adverse change in the financial condition of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, our business and our ability to generate the cash needed to operate our business.\nWe may not be able to enhance our product solutions and develop new product solutions in a timely manner.\nOur future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to provide new products that compare favorably with alternative solutions on the basis of time to introduction, cost, performance, and end-user preferences. Our success in attracting and retaining customers and developing business will depend on various factors, including the following:\ninnovative development of new products for customers;\nutilization of advances in technology;\nmaintenance of quality standards;\nefficient and cost-effective solutions; and\ntimely completion of the design and introduction of new products.\nOur inability to develop new product solutions on a timely basis could harm our operating results and impede our growth.\nOur operating results may experience significant fluctuations.\nIn addition to the variability resulting from the short-term nature of our customers\u2019 commitments, other factors contribute to significant periodic fluctuations in our results of operations. These factors include:\nthe cyclicality of the markets we serve;\nthe timing and size of orders;\nthe volume of orders relative to our capacity;\nproduct introductions and market acceptance of new products or new generations of products;\nevolution in the life cycles of our customers\u2019 products;\ntiming of expenses in anticipation of future orders;\nchanges in product mix;\navailability of manufacturing and assembly services;\nchanges in cost and availability of labor and components;\ntimely delivery of product solutions to customers;\npricing and availability of competitive products;\nintroduction of new technologies into the markets we serve;\npressures on reducing selling prices;\nour success in serving new markets; and\nchanges in economic conditions.\nIf we do not keep pace with technological innovations, our products may not be competitive and our revenue and operating results may suffer.\nThe electronic, semiconductor, solar, automotive and general industrial segments are subject to constant technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function and quality. If we rely on products and technologies that are not attractive to end users, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining market share. Technological advances, the introduction of new products, and new design techniques could adversely affect our business prospects unless we are able to adapt to the changing conditions. Technological advances could render our products obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. As a result, we will be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to:\ncontinue research and development activities on all product lines;\nhire additional engineering and other technical personnel; and\npurchase advanced design tools and test equipment.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors do so more effectively than we do.\nOur efforts to develop new technologies may not result in commercial success and/or may result in delays in development, which could cause a decline in our revenue and could harm our business.\nOur research and development efforts with respect to our technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development lab to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even when we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our customers may decide not to introduce or may discontinue products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including the following:\ndifficulties with other suppliers of components for the products;\nsuperior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies;\nprice considerations; and\nlack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products.\nThe nature of our business will require us to make continuing investments to develop new technologies. Significant expenses relating to one or more new technologies that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful for any reason could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, any investments or acquisitions made to enhance our technologies may prove to be unsuccessful. If our efforts are unsuccessful, our business could be harmed.\nContinuing uncertainty of the U.S. and global economy may have serious implications for the growth and stability of our business.\nRevenue growth and continued profitability of our business will depend significantly on the overall demand for test and measurement instrumentations in key markets including research and development, automotive, semiconductor and electronics. Softening demand in these markets caused by ongoing economic uncertainty, a return to recessionary conditions, technological developments, competitive changes or other factors may result in decreased revenue or earnings levels. The U.S. and global economy has been historically cyclical and market conditions continue to be challenging, which has resulted in individuals and companies delaying or reducing expenditures. Further delays or reductions in spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products, and consequently on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, stock price, and ability to continue to operate.\nVariability of customer requirements resulting in cancellations, reductions, or delays may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are required to provide rapid product turnaround and respond to short lead times. A variety of conditions, both specific to individual customers and generally affecting the demand for OEMs\u2019 products, may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders. Cancellations, reductions, or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers could adversely affect our operating results. Conversely, if our customers unexpectedly and significantly increase product orders, we may be required to rapidly increase production, which could strain our resources and reduce our margins.\nThe cyclical nature of the electronics and military industries may result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nThe electronics and military industries have experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, and production overcapacity. We may seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy.\nInternational sales risks could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our operating results could be adversely affected by changes to U.S. policy and fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.\nHaving a worldwide distribution network for our products exposes us to various economic, political, and other risks that could adversely affect our operations and operating results, including the following:\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\ntiming to meet regulatory requirements;\ntariffs, duties and other trade barrier restrictions;\ngreater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\nthe burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws;\npotentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights; and\npolitical or economic instability in certain parts of the world.\nAll of these risks associated with international sales could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe anticipate possible changes to current policies by the U.S. government that could affect our business, including potentially through increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade relations with other countries (e.g., China). Our suppliers source some of their raw materials from foreign countries, so any tariffs imposed by the U.S. government on imports into the United States would likely increase our cost of product revenue and, as a result, decrease our gross margins, operating income and net income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Further, if the U.S. government imposes tariffs on imports into the United States, other countries may respond by imposing tariffs on products manufactured in the United States, which would increase the price of our products in these countries and may result in our customers looking to alternative sources for our products. Further, the imposition of such tariffs, and other recent and potential actions of the U.S government with respect to other countries, may generate negative views of the United States in other countries and make persons in those countries less inclined to purchase products from U.S. companies like us.\nIn addition, we transact our business in U.S. dollars and bill and collect our sales in U.S. dollars. In 2016, approximately 32.3% of our revenue was from customers located outside of the United States. It is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about policy could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial condition related to transactions denominated in a foreign currency. A weakening of the dollar could cause our overseas vendors to require renegotiation of either the prices or currency we pay for their goods and services. Similarly, a strengthening of the dollar could cause our products to be more expensive for our international customers, which could impact price and margins and/or cause the demand for our products, and thus our revenue, to decline.\nIn the future, customers may negotiate pricing and make payments in non-U.S. currencies. If our overseas vendors or customers require us to transact business in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods, operating expenses, and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not freely traded. We cannot predict the impact that future exchange rate fluctuations may have on our operating results.\nOur confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, which could limit our ability to compete.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology and processes. Trade secrets are difficult to protect. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties confidential information developed by the party under such agreements or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. However, these agreements may not be honored and enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Our failure to obtain and maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace, and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel.\nOur success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and key personnel. The competition for qualified management and key personnel, especially engineers, is intense. Although we maintain non-competition and non-disclosure covenants with most of our key personnel, we do not have employment agreements with most of them. The loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to hire, train, and retain key personnel, especially engineers, technical support personnel, and capable sales and customer-support employees outside the United States, could delay the development and sale of our products, disrupt our business, and interfere with our ability to execute our business plan.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well.\nPursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement entered into between the Company and Brookstone, the Company is obligated to register for resale the shares of common stock sold to Brookstone in October 2016. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market after such registration, or the perception that these sales may occur, could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nBrookstone\u2019s ownership of 41.6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock gives it a controlling interest in the Company.\nBrookstone owns approximately 41.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock and has designated three directors that sit on our seven-member Board of Directors. Accordingly, Brookstone has the ability to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and, as a practical matter, will control corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, irrespective of how our other shareholders may vote, including the election of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions, including a sale of substantially all of our assets, and Brookstone may vote its shares in a manner that is adverse to the interests of our minority stockholders. For example, Brookstone will be able to prevent a merger or similar transaction, including a transaction in which stockholders will receive a premium for their shares, even if our other shareholders are in favor of such transaction. This concentration of voting control could deprive our investors of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock as part of a sale of the Company. Further, Brookstone\u2019s control position might adversely affect the market price of our common stock to the extent investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of a company with a controlling shareholder.\nBrookstone and their director designees may acquire interests and positions that could present potential conflicts with our and our shareholders\u2019 interests.\nBrookstone and their director designees may make investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Brookstone and their director designees may also pursue, for their own accounts, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities might not be available to us. As part of our sale of the Shares to Brookstone in October 2016 and as required by Brookstone as a condition to purchasing the Shares, our Board of Directors renounced, to the extent permitted by New York law, the Company's expectancy with respect to being offered an opportunity to participate in any business opportunity that is discovered by or presented to a director designee (a \u201cBusiness Opportunity\u201d), whether in such director designee\u2019s capacity as a director of the Company or otherwise. Accordingly, the interests of Brookstone and the designated directors with respect to a Business Opportunity may supersede ours, and Brookstone or its affiliates or the Brookstone-designated directors may be involved with business in competition with us and may pursue opportunities for the sole benefit of Brookstone and its affiliates without our involvement, for which we have limited recourse. Such actions on the part of Brookstone or its director designees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from selling our products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.\nWe may receive notices from third parties that the manufacture, use, or sale of any products we develop infringes upon one or more claims of their patents. Moreover, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that materially and adversely affect our business. Third parties could also assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to our future product offerings, if any. We cannot be certain that we have not infringed the intellectual property rights of any third parties. Any infringement or misappropriation claim could result in significant costs, substantial damages, and our inability to manufacture, market, or sell any of our product offerings that are found to infringe another person\u2019s patent. Even if we were to prevail in any such action, the litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources that could materially and adversely affect our business. If a court determined, or if we independently discovered, that our product offerings violated third-party proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that we would be able to re-engineer our product offerings to avoid those rights or obtain a license under those rights on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. As a result, we could be prohibited from selling products that are found to infringe upon the rights of others. Even if obtaining a license were feasible, it may be costly and time-consuming. A court could also enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily, or permanently enjoin us from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products that are found to infringe on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, or could enter orders mandating that we undertake certain remedial actions. Further, a court could order us to pay compensatory damages for any such infringement, plus prejudgment interest, and could in addition treble the compensatory damages and award attorneys\u2019 fees. Any such payments could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption or failure, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation may be damaged.\nOur business involves the collection, storage and transmission of personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Our information systems also contain the Company's proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. Our efforts to protect such information may be unsuccessful due to the actions of third parties, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, catastrophic events, employee error or malfeasance or other attempts to harm our systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in time. We could also experience a loss of critical data and delays or interruptions in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions. Some of our commercial partners, such as those that help us maintain our websites, may receive or store information provided by us or our users through our websites. If these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate information security practices, or fail to comply with our policies in this regard, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our customers\u2019 information may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\nIf our systems are harmed or fail to function properly, we may need to expend significant financial resources to repair or replace systems or to otherwise protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. If we experience a significant security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant security breach, we could be exposed to costly legal actions against us in connection with such incidents, which could result in orders or judgments forcing us to pay damages or fines or to take certain actions with respect to our information systems. Any incidents involving unauthorized access to or improper use of user information, or incidents that are a violation of our online privacy could harm our brand reputation and diminish our competitive position. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation or financial results. Our insurance policies carry coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nIn the future, we may experience an ownership change in the Company that would result in a limitation of tax attributes relating to the use of our net operating losses.\nA corporation generally undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d when the ownership of its stock, by value, changes by more than 50 percentage points over any three-year testing period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership change net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and certain recognized built-in losses.\nWe estimate that as of December 31, 2016, the Company and MTI Instruments have NOL carryforwards of approximately $51.9 million. Our ability to utilize these NOL carryforwards, including any future NOL carryforwards that may arise, may be limited by Section 382 if we undergo any further \u201cownership changes\u201d as a result of subsequent changes in the ownership of our outstanding common stock pursuant to the exercise of MTI options outstanding, additional financings obtained, or otherwise.\nOur risk management process may not identify all risks that we are subject to and will not eliminate all risk.\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process seeks to identify and address significant risks. Our ERM process uses the most recent integrated risk framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to assess, manage, and monitor risks. We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy. Our goals are to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value, and to manage prudently, rather than wholly avoiding, risks. We can mitigate risks and their impact on the Company, however, only to a limited extent, and no ERM process can identify all risks that we may face. Therefore, there may be risks that we are currently unaware of, that may develop in the future or that we currently consider immaterial. Further, our management of risks may prove inadequate. The emergence of risks of which we were unaware or are unable to manage could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospectus, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 52231, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "MKTY"}
