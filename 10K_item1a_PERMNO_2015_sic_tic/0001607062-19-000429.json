{"cik": "1059784", "company": "GENEREX BIOTECHNOLOGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-11-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations and remain a going concern; we may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us.\nOur operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash and we have sustained negative cash flows from our operations for the last several years. We will require future additional capital infusions including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities and/or products that are complementary to our own capabilities and/or products, in order to continue the development of our product candidates. However, there can be no assurances that we will complete any financings, strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements, and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us. Any additional equity financing will be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize. Our failure to raise capital when needed could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a history of losses and will incur additional losses.\nHistorically, we have been a clinical development company with a limited line of commercial products in international markets. In 2018, we began to recognize revenues resulting from the acquisition of the Veneto assets and operations. In 2019, we launched our first commercial product Excellagen, which we expect to generate ongoing revenues going forward. While we have begun to generate revenues, we are still operating at a loss, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to grow the revenues enough to offset our costs to realize profitability.\nTo date, we have not been profitable and our accumulated net loss available to shareholders was $416 million at July 31, 2019. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development, including clinical trials, and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. In order to commercialize our historical assets and our recently acquired product pipeline, we will need to conduct substantial additional research, development and clinical trials. We will also need to receive necessary regulatory clearances both in the United States and foreign countries and obtain meaningful patent protection for and establish freedom to commercialize each of our product candidates. We must also complete further clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for any new product candidates we discover, in-license, or acquire. We cannot be sure that we will obtain required regulatory approvals, or successfully research, develop, commercialize, manufacture and market any other product candidates. We expect that these activities, together with future general and administrative activities, will result in significant expenses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve profitability.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective in future periods as a result of existing or newly identified material weaknesses in internal controls.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such control. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be adversely impacted, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and our business and stock price could be adversely affected.\nAt July 31, 2019, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and concluded that, subject to the inherent limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of several significant deficiencies culminating in material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting because of inadequate segregation of duties over authorization, review and recording of transactions, as well as the financial reporting of such transactions. We have not made a formal determination that our disclosure control and procedures are effective since that date.\nWe believe we have taken appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate these deficiencies, however we cannot be certain that our remediation efforts will ensure that our management designs, implements and maintains adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that the changes made will be sufficient to address and eliminate the material weaknesses previously identified. Our inability to remedy any additional deficiencies or material weaknesses that may be identified in the future could, among other things, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as impair our ability to meet our quarterly, annual and other reporting requirements under the Exchange Act in a timely manner, and require us to incur additional costs or to divert management resources.\nOur research and development and commercialization efforts may depend on entering into agreements with corporate collaborators.\nBecause we have limited resources, we have sought to enter into collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical companies that will assist us in developing, testing, obtaining governmental approval for and commercializing products. We may be unable to achieve commercialization of any of our products until we obtain a large pharmaceutical partner to assist us in such commercialization efforts. To date, we have entered into a collaborative development program with Merck to evaluate our immunotherapeutic peptide vaccine AE37 in combination with Merck\u2019s Keytruda for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer in a phase II clinical trial, however, this collaboration only involves the donation of Keytruda for the clinical trial, and any future financial commitment from Merck for a co-development deal is dependent on the successful completion of the trial. There is no guarantee that the results of the trial will be positive, or that Merck will continue the collaboration with financial support.\nAdditionally, we have out-licensed AE37 for the immunotherapeutic treatment of prostate cancer to Shenzhen Bioscien (\u201cShenzhen\u201d), a Chinese biopharmaceutical company that has agreed to fund the development of AE37 for prostate cancer through a clinical development program conducted under ICH guidelines that would allow global registration of the AE37 product in the prostate cancer indication. The development deal includes upfront and milestone payments to Generex, together with a double-digit royalty on sales of AE37 in China in exchange for the rights to AE37 for prostate cancer treatment in China, with the ex-China global rights remaining with us. Though Shenzhen has made an upfront payment of $700,000 to us, there is no guarantee that they will continue to fulfill their contractual obligations to advance the clinical development of AE37 for prostate cancer. Further, there is no guarantee that AE37 will prove to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of prostate cancer, or that the product will be approved by regulatory authorities.\nMoving forward, we will need to expand current collaborations and develop new collaborations to advance new products that Generex and its subsidiaries may wish to commercialize. We will continue to seek research collaborations, co-development and marketing agreements, and licensing deals for its products in development, however, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts.\nAny collaborator with whom we may enter into such collaboration agreements may not support fully our research and commercial interests since our program may compete for time, attention and resources with such collaborator's internal programs. Therefore, these collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our program to move it forward effectively, or that the program will advance as rapidly as it might if we had retained complete control of all research, development, regulatory and commercialization decisions.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have reorganized our business model to transform us from a research & development biotechnology company to an integrated life science and healthcare holding company that generates revenues through its subsidiary companies. There is no guarantee that this business transformation will be successful.\nSince our new management team took control in January 2017, we have focused our efforts on making strategic acquisitions that will form the foundation for building an end-to-end business model for the delivery of products and services through proprietary market channels to physicians and patients. The initial step in the process was the acquisition of the Veneto group of assets that provided an operating MSO with revenues, a network of physician partners (primarily orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists), contracts with ancillary health services companies, including pharmacies and laboratories, and infrastructure, personnel, and IT systems that are scalable to meet the demands of growth. With the goal of adding new products and services that can be utilized by the MSO physicians in our proprietary network, we have acquired, and are in the process of acquiring revenue-generating companies in the fields of wound care, surgical supplies, orthopedic implants, artificial joints, biologics, medical devices, and regenerative medicine products. There are a number of risks associated with this end-to-end healthcare model, and there is no guarantee that the model will deliver the expected revenues and profits going forward.\nAs we evolve from being a company that was primarily involved in clinical development to a company that is also involved in commercialization of novel products, including manufacturing, distribution, and utilization, we may encounter difficulties in expanding our operations successfully.\nWe have been reorganized as a life science and healthcare holding company, with wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries that operate independently. Our operating subsidiaries are led by management teams who are responsible for operating the businesses and achieving corporate revenue and profit targets. Our corporate strategy is to unite the subsidiary companies, together with the NuGenerex family of companies, through shared client access, cross-selling opportunities, share services, and joint development programs. If the subsidiary companies do not work together to build the organization as envisioned, we may not realize the revenue and profit expectations that are based on the synergies among our subsidiaries to drive intra-company sales.\nAs we pursue our plans to reorganize the historical Generex clinical stage assets into separate operating subsidiaries that can more effectively advance the clinical development and commercial value of our product pipeline, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the financing necessary to support our clinical development programs.\nThrough the corporate restructuring, we have formed three subsidiaries to house the historical Generex assets, including NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, NuGenerex Diagnostics (NGDx), and NuGenerex Therapeutics (housing the Oral-Lyn oral insulin product and the RapidMist buccal delivery technology). Each of these subsidiaries require significant funds and commercialization partners to advance their products and technologies through the clinical development and regulatory processes necessary to achieve product commercialization. We may not be able to obtain the necessary funds or find corporate partners to commercialize our historical assets, which will negatively affect the value of these assets.\nWe may not be able to unlock the intrinsic value of our historical development pipeline, because we may encounter difficulties in financing and operating our commercial development programs successfully.\nAs we advance our product candidates through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, and may need to further contract with third parties to provide these capabilities. As our operations expand, we likely will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators, distributors, marketers, and suppliers.\nMaintaining third party relationships for these purposes will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management and other personnel. We must be able to: manage our development efforts effectively; recruit and train sales and marketing personnel; manage our participation in the clinical trials in which our product candidates are involved effectively; and improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing, or distribution services, any product revenues that we receive, or the profitability of these product revenues to us, are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop without the involvement of these third parties. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or in doing so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.\nFuture business combinations or acquisitions may be difficult to integrate, which could cause us to shift our attention away from our primary business and its operations.\nWe may pursue future business combinations with other companies or strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, product lines, or technologies. There can be no assurance that such acquisitions will be available at all, nor on terms acceptable to us. These transactions may require additional capital, which may increase our indebtedness or outstanding shares, resulting in a dilution to our stockholders or a reduction in working capital. The inability to obtain such future capital may inhibit our growth and operating results. Integration of acquisitions or additional products can be costly, time-consuming, and complicated which could significantly impact operating results. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition may disproportionally divert our executive team\u2019s time and resources from our primary business and its operations. We may sell some or all of our product lines to other companies or we may agree to merge with another company. There can be no assurance that future transactions will ultimately benefit us. If we face difficulty integrating future acquisitions or if our executive team\u2019s attention is diverted, our future results of operations may negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe MSO acquired in the Veneto transaction may not continue to participate in the business following the acquisition.\nThe MSO acquired from Veneto is named Rapport Services, LLC (\u201cRapport\u201d), which is a physician-owned limited liability company (or LLC) requiring an at-risk equity investment from physicians or physician groups that wish to participate in the network. The Rapport physician investors own 99% of Rapport, and Generex (through its wholly-owned subsidiary NuGenerex Distribution Solutions 2) owns 1% and serves as the managing director of the LLC. The MSO was built through relationships between physicians and the previous Veneto administration. There is no guarantee that the current network of physician partners will remain with Rapport. There is no guarantee that the physicians will continue to utilize the ancillary healthcare services that Rapport provides the MSO through contractual relationships with pharmacies, labs, or other providers of ancillary services.\nRegulatory actions may affect our ability to operate.\nOur MSO and pharmaceutical distribution businesses operate in fields that are very highly regulated by both the federal government and state pharmacy licensing agencies. Adverse decisions by the DEA or state pharmacy regulators could materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our distributions business. The MSOs we manage are primarily owned by physicians and serve pharmacy and other healthcare organizations. We believe that our MSO business is structured to comply with laws and regulations governing economic relationships between physicians and other health care providers, such as fraud and abuse laws. If regulators or courts determine our activities did not comply, we may be required to restructure our business in a manner that would reduce or eliminate its profitability.\nThe MSO model may not be profitable without the right product mix and reimbursements from payors.\nThe Rapport MSO operates as a limited liability company, and therefore distributes profits to the members based upon their equity interest. Profitability is determined based the revenues generated by reimbursements, the cost of goods sold, and the cost of services. The success of the MSO model is predicated on several factors, including: 1) the ability to obtain competitive and specialty pricing from ancillary providers of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, surgical supplies, and biologics used by the physicians in the MSO for the optimal care of their patients; 2) the reimbursements for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, surgical supplies, and biologics that are established and paid by third-party payors, including insurance companies, pharmacy benefits managers (or PBMs), distributors, and employers; 3) the cost for delivering ancillary services, including personnel, facilities, licenses, insurances, and administrative expenses, among others, and 4) the ability to grow the business with new partners, clients, products and services that provide new and increased revenue streams. We may not obtain pricing for goods and services that provide enough margin to maintain profitability. Reimbursements from third-party payors for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, surgical supplies, and biologics are under cost pressure, and subject to change on a quarterly basis, with the threat of reduced reimbursements an ongoing concern. We may not be able to maintain the flexibility required or have the financing to support the appropriate level of personnel, lease the correct number and type of facilities, secure the requisite licenses, and grow the business as projected due to the variability of business cycles, the uncertainty in cost of goods and services, and the ongoing threat of declining reimbursements.\nBased on the opinion of counsel, we believe that the Rapport MSO model is currently legal in 22 states, however, state laws and regulations often change.\nTo our knowledge, Rapport, a physician-owned limited liability company is operated in full compliance with all state and federal regulations. Although we have obtained third-party legal guidance, there is no guarantee that the legal guidance is correct, nor that the Rapport model is in full compliance with all regulations, nor that regulations will change rendering the model noncompliant.\nThe regulations pertaining to the physician-owned MSO model may change such that the Rapport model is no longer compliant with state laws, requiring changes to the MSO model.\nChanges to federal and state regulations may have significant adverse effect on the business. If the regulations change such that the Rapport MSO model is no longer allowed, we will need to change our business model to maintain compliance. Despite the fact that we are currently planning to institute additional service models under the NuGenerex subsidiary, there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain a profitable business that is in compliance with laws and regulations.\nIf the statutes and regulations in our industry change, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to improve patient safety, improve clinical outcomes, and increase access to medical care. These changes include enactments and repeals of various healthcare related laws and regulation. Our operations and economic viability may be adversely affected by the changes in such regulations, including: (i) federal and state fraud and abuse laws; (ii) federal and state anti-kickback statutes; (iii) federal and state false claims laws; (iv) federal and state self-referral laws; (v) state restrictions on fee splitting; (vi) laws regarding the privacy and confidentiality of patient information; and (vii) other laws and government regulations.\nIf there are changes in laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, we may have to change our business practices, or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are expanding our product and service offerings to offset risk associated with the cost of goods and regulatory concerns, however, there is no guarantee that the new products and services will be successful in the marketplace.\nWe launched DMEiq, LLC (\u201cDME-IQ\u201d), a tablet-based software and service business designed to help orthopedic practices manage and operate an in-house program for orthopedic durable medical equipment (or DME). While we are beginning to generate revenues with the first implementation of DME-IQ, the return on investment for us is still to be proven. The sales cycle for contracting with new orthopedic practices to implement the DME-IQ program is long, and requires multiple meetings, financial and practice analysis, and legal/regulatory review. There is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve our sales goals.\nWe are in the process of acquiring manufacturers and suppliers of orthopedic implants, surgical supplies and tools, and biologics that can be utilized by the MSO network. There is no guarantee that these acquisitions will be completed, or if completed, that the products will be chosen by the MSO physicians in the surgical and medical practices.\nOur subsidiary Olaregen is offering our newly launched product for wound management, Excellagen to the MSO network of orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists. There is no guarantee that we will get Excellagen on hospital and insurance formularies for reimbursement. Therefore, there is a risk that the product may not be utilized as expected.\n\u2003\nWe have non-binding letters of intent to acquire companies that manufacture and distribute orthopedic implants, surgical supplies and equipment, and biologics. If we complete the target acquisitions, our operating earnings will be dependent on certain significant suppliers.\nThe target acquisitions use original equipment manufacturers & suppliers to support their operations. They distribute products from dozens of suppliers and are dependent on these suppliers for the continuing supply of products. The companies rely on suppliers to provide agreeable purchasing and delivery terms and performance incentives. Our ability to sustain adequate operating earnings will be dependent upon our ability to obtain favorable terms and incentives from suppliers, as well as suppliers\u2019 continuing use of third-party distributors to sell and deliver their products. An unforeseen delay in raw material supplies, a change in terms by a significant supplier, or a decision of such a supplier to distribute its products directly to healthcare providers rather than through third-party distributors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, and the nature of our business and rapid changes in the healthcare industry makes it difficult to reliably predict future growth and operating results.\nWe may not be able to successfully grow and expand. Successful implementation of our business plan will require management of growth, including potentially rapid and substantial growth, which could result in an increase in the level of responsibility for management personnel and strain on our human and capital resources. To manage growth effectively, we will be required, among other things, to continue to implement and improve our operating and financial systems, procedures and controls and to expand, train and manage our employee base. If we are unable to implement and scale improvements to our existing systems and controls in an efficient and timely manner or if we encounter deficiencies, we will not be able to successfully execute our business plans.\nFailure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified personnel could also impede our growth.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The evolving nature of our business and rapid changes in the healthcare industry make it difficult to anticipate the nature and amount of medical reimbursements, third-party private payments, and participation in certain government programs and thus to reliably predict our future growth and operating results. Our growth strategy may incur significant costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition. Our growth by strategic transactions strategy involves significant costs, including financial advisory, legal and accounting fees, and may include additional costs for items such as fairness opinions and severance payments. These costs could put a strain on our cash flows, which in turn could adversely affect our overall financial condition.\nWe are regulated by federal Anti-Kickback Statutes\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a provision of the Social Security Act of 1972 that prohibits as a felony offense the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (1) the referral of a patient for items or services for which payment may be made in whole or part under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, (2) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs or (3) the purchase, lease, or order or arranging or recommending the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) amended section 1128B of the Social Security Act to make it clear that a person need not have actual knowledge of the statute, or specific intent to violate the statute, as a predicate for a violation. The OIG, which has the authority to impose administrative sanctions for violation of the statute, has adopted as its standard for review a judicial interpretation which concludes that the statute prohibits any arrangement where even one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines of up to $25,000, civil fines of up to $50,000 per violation, and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. A violation also can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. In addition, pursuant to the changes of the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a false claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nWe cannot assure that the applicable regulatory authorities will not determine that some of our arrangements with physicians violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to different liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other health care programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are regulated by federal Stark Laws\nThe federal Stark Law, 42 U.S.C. 1395nn, also known as the physician self-referral law, generally prohibits a physician from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity (including hospitals) providing \u2018\u2018designated health services,\u2019\u2019 if the physician or a member of the physician\u2019s immediate family has a \u2018\u2018financial relationship\u2019\u2019 with the entity, unless a specific exception applies. Designated health services include, among other services, inpatient hospital services, outpatient prescription drug services, clinical laboratory services, certain imaging services (e.g., MRI, CT, ultrasound), and other services that our affiliated physicians may order for their patients. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral; and therefore, unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, intent to violate the law is not required. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law contains statutory and regulatory exceptions intended to protect certain types of transactions and arrangements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, an arrangement must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law.\nBecause the Stark Law and implementing regulations continue to evolve and are detailed and complex, while we attempt to structure its relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, there can be no assurance that the arrangements entered into by us with affiliated physicians and facilities will be found to be in compliance with the Stark Law, as it ultimately may be implemented or interpreted. The penalties for violating the Stark Law can include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services, and civil penalties of up to $15,000 for each violation, double damages, and possible exclusion from future participation in the governmental healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law\u2019s prohibitions may be fined up to $100,000 for each applicable arrangement or scheme.\nSome states have enacted statutes and regulations against self-referral arrangements similar to the federal Stark Law, but which may be applicable to the referral of patients regardless of their payor source and which may apply to different types of services. These state laws may contain statutory and regulatory exceptions that are different from those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state. An adverse determination under these state laws and/or the federal Stark Law could subject us to different liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other health care programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe must comply with Health Information Privacy and Security Standards\nThe privacy regulations Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended, contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable patient health information (\u201cPHI\u201d) by entities like our MSOs and affiliated IPAs and medical groups. HIPAA covered entities must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health information received, maintained, or transmitted. HIPAA also implemented standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including billing and claim collection activities. Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules may result in civil and criminal penalties, including a tiered system of civil money penalties that range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, with a cap of $1.5 million per year for identical violations. A HIPAA covered entity must also promptly notify affected individuals where a breach affects more than 500 individuals and report breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals annually. State attorneys general may bring civil actions on behalf of state residents for violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules, obtain damages on behalf of state residents, and enjoin further violations.\nMany states also have laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential, personal information, which may be similar to or even more stringent than HIPAA. Some of these state laws may impose fines and penalties on violators and may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. We expect increased federal and state privacy and security enforcement efforts.\nA cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of customer and patient privacy, or other negative impacts.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology (or IT) systems to manage scheduling and financial data, communicate with customers and their patients, vendors, and other third parties, and summarize and analyze operating results. In addition, we have made significant investments in technology, including the engagement of a third-party IT provider. A cyber-attack that bypasses our IT security systems could cause an IT security breach, a loss of protected health information, or other data subject to privacy laws, a loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption of our IT business systems. This in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations. In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of public health information, other confidential data, or proprietary business information.\nComputer malware, viruses, and hacking and phishing attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until successfully launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. As cyber-security threats develop and grow, it may be necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, (i) we could suffer severe reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, (ii) the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, (iii) we could lose potential sales and existing customers, our ability to deliver our services or operate our business may be impaired, (iv) we may be subject to litigation or regulatory investigations or orders, and (v) we may incur significant liabilities. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the potentially significant losses that may result from security breaches. Additionally, while we currently do not have cybersecurity coverage, we plan to evaluate options for this type of coverage in late 2019, or early 2020.\nWe must comply with Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations\nWe are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of waste materials and products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling and disposing of these materials and products comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from those hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance coverage, which we may not be able to maintain on acceptable terms, or at all. We could incur significant costs and attention of our management could be diverted to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations. Federal regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration impose additional requirements on us, including those protecting employees from exposure to elements such as blood-borne pathogens. We cannot predict the frequency of compliance, monitoring, or enforcement actions to which we may be subject as those regulations are being implemented, which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe must comply with a range of other Federal and State Healthcare Laws.\nWe are also subject to other federal and state healthcare laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The Health Care Fraud Statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, which can be either a government or private payor plan. Violation of this statute, even in the absence of actual knowledge of or specific intent to violate the statute, may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. The Health Care False Statement Statute prohibits, in any matter involving a federal health care program, anyone from knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up, by any trick, scheme or device, a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement. A violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment or both. Under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law of the Social Security Act, a person (including an organization) is prohibited from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to any United States officer, employee, agent, or department, or any state agency, a claim for payment for medical or other items or services where the person knows or should know (a) the items or services were not provided as described in the coding of the claim, (b) the claim is a false or fraudulent claim, (c) the claim is for a service furnished by an unlicensed physician, (d) the claim is for medical or other items or service furnished by a person or an entity that is in a period of exclusion from the program, or (e) the items or services are medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of the law may result in penalties of up to $10,000 per claim, treble damages, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs.\nIn addition, the office of inspector general (\u201cOIG\u201d) may impose civil monetary penalties against any physician who knowingly accepts payment from a hospital (as well as against the hospital making the payment) as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services provided to Medicare or Medicaid program beneficiaries. Further, except as permitted under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act.\nIn addition to the state laws previously described, we may also be subject to other state fraud and abuse statutes and regulations if we expand our operations nationally. Many states have adopted a form of anti-kickback law, self-referral prohibition, and false claims and insurance fraud prohibition. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Generally, state laws reach to all healthcare services and not just those covered under a governmental healthcare program. A determination of liability under any of these laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these states. We cannot assure that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.\nChanges in healthcare laws could create an uncertain environment and materially impact us.\nWe cannot predict the effect that the ACA (also known as Obamacare) and its implementation, amendment, or repeal and replacement, may have on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any changes in healthcare laws or regulations that reduce, curtail or eliminate payments, government-subsidized programs, government-sponsored programs, and/or the expansion of Medicare or Medicaid, among other actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the ACA dramatically changed how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. The ACA requires insurers to accept all applicants, regardless of pre-existing conditions, cover an extensive list of conditions and treatments, and charge the same rates, regardless of pre-existing condition or gender.\nThe ACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cHealth Care Reform Acts\u201d) also mandated changes specific to home health and hospice benefits under Medicare. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA, including the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d provisions of the ACA that generally require all individuals to obtain healthcare insurance or pay a penalty. However, the U.S. Supreme Court also held that the provision of the ACA that authorized the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) to penalize states that choose not to participate in the expansion of the Medicaid program by removing all of its existing Medicaid funding was unconstitutional. In response to the ruling, a number of state governors opposed its state\u2019s participation in the expanded Medicaid program, which resulted in the ACA not providing coverage to some low-income persons in those states. In addition, several bills have been, and are continuing to be, introduced in U.S. Congress to amend all or significant provisions of the ACA, or repeal and replace the ACA with another law. In December 2017, the individual mandate was repealed via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Afterwards, legal and political challenges as to the constitutionality of the remaining provisions of the ACA resumed.\nOur operations are subject to the nation\u2019s healthcare laws, as amended, repealed, or replaced from time to time.\nThe net effect of the ACA on our business is subject to numerous variables, including the law\u2019s complexity, lack of complete implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation or possible amendment, as well as the uncertainty as to the extent to which states will choose to participate in the expanded Medicaid program. The continued implementation of provisions of the ACA, the adoption of new regulations thereunder and ongoing challenges thereto, also added uncertainty about the current state of U.S. healthcare laws and could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Healthcare providers could be subject to federal and state investigations and payor audits.\nDue to our and our affiliates\u2019 participation in government and private healthcare programs, we are from time to time involved in inquiries, reviews, audits, and investigations by governmental agencies and private payors of our business practices, including assessments of our compliance with coding, billing and documentation requirements. Federal and state government agencies have active civil and criminal enforcement efforts against healthcare companies, and their executives and managers. The Deficit Reduction Act (\u201cDRA\u201d), which provides a financial incentive to states to enact their own false claims acts, and similar laws encourage investigations against healthcare companies by different agencies. These investigations could also be initiated by private whistleblowers.\nResponding to audit and investigative activities are costly and disruptive to our business operations, even when the allegations are without merit. If we are subject to an audit or investigation, a finding could be made that we or our affiliates erroneously billed or were incorrectly reimbursed, and we may be required to repay such agencies or payors, may be subjected to pre-payment reviews, which can be time-consuming and result in non-payment or delayed payments for the services we or our affiliates provide, and may be subject to financial sanctions or required to modify our operations.\nProduct pricing is subject to regulatory control.\nRoutinely, the pricing and profitability of the products we sell are subject to control by third-party payors. The continuing efforts of governmental and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare through various means may adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products. We anticipate that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control, although it is unclear which proposals will ultimately become law, if any. Direct or indirect changes in prices, including any mandated pricing, could impact our revenues, profitability, and financial performance.\nOur revenues will depend on our customers\u2019 continued receipt of adequate reimbursement from private insurers and government sponsored healthcare programs.\nPolitical, economic, and regulatory influences continue to change the healthcare industry in the United States. The ability of hospitals to pay fees for our products partially depends on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such materials and related treatments will continue to be available from private health coverage insurers and other similar organizations. We may have difficulty gaining market acceptance for the products we sell if third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement to hospitals.\nMajor third-party payors of hospitals, such as private healthcare insurers, periodically revise their payment methodologies based, in part, upon changes in government sponsored healthcare programs. We cannot predict these periodic revisions with certainty, and such revisions may result in stricter standards for reimbursement of hospital charges for certain specified products, potentially adversely impacting our business, results of operations, and financial conditions.\nThe FDA regulates the manufacturers and suppliers of the products that we sell, market, manufacture, and distribute, and regulatory compliance is costly and could contribute to delays in the availability of our products.\nUnder FDA regulations, we are subject to the same FDA regulation as the manufacturers and suppliers to whom we distribute. These regulations govern (i) the manufacturing and processing of cellular and tissue products; (ii) the introduction of new medical devices; (iii) the observance of certain standards with respect to the design, manufacturing, testing, labeling, promotion, and sales of the devices; (iv) the maintenance of certain records; (v) the ability to track devices; (vi) the reporting of potential product defects; (vii) the importing and exporting of devices; and (viii) various other matters. Furthermore, manufacturers that create the products we market face an increasing amount of scrutiny and compliance costs as more states implement regulations governing medical devices and Biologics. In addition, we are subject to ongoing compliance concerning our 510(k) Approvals, as well as potential on-site inspections by the FDA. Being found in violation and failing to correct an FDA compliance issue could potentially result in product recall, product seizure, or the de-listing of our products with 510(k) Approval. These types of FDA regulations could affect many of the products we market, impacting our revenues and profitability, results of operations, and working capital.\nFuture regulatory action remains uncertain.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and evolving environment with rigorous regulatory enforcement. Any legal or regulatory action could be time-consuming and costly. If we or the manufacturers or distributors that supply our products fail to comply with all applicable laws, standards, and regulations, action by the FDA or other regulatory agencies could result in significant restrictions, including restrictions on the marketing or use of the products we sell or the withdrawal of the products we sell from the market. Any such restrictions or withdrawals could materially affect our reputation, business and operations.\nU.S. federal and state governmental regulation could restrict our ability to sell our products.\nOur business is subject to highly complex and evolving regulatory and licensing requirements that are subject to uncertainty, rapid change, differing interpretations, and rigorous regulatory enforcement. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or the exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs. There can be no assurance that federal or state regulatory or enforcement authorities will not investigate or challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any state or federal regulatory or enforcement review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether these changes are retroactive or will affect our Company on a going-forward basis only. Any investigation or challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe FDA and similar state authorities require us to list and register certain products, because we are a distributor, marketer, specification developer and repackager/relabeler and manufacturer for FDA-regulated products.\nIf we are successful in executing our business plan, we will be a distributor, marketer, and specification developer and repackager/relabeler of FDA-regulated products, and as such we may be subject to independent requirements to register and list certain products. We may be required to obtain state licensure or certifications and may be subject to inspections, in addition to complying with derivative requirements applicable to the manufacturers of the products we market. Failure to comply with such applicable requirements could result in a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from warning letters to more severe sanctions, such as significant costly fines and civil penalties, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecutions, all of which could adversely impact our business.\nOur product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even after they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any of our approved commercial products could be suspended.\nEven as we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or discover any previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on the products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf warning letters;\n\u25cf civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf fines;\n\u25cf injunctions;\n\u25cf product seizures or detentions;\n\u25cf pressure to initiate voluntary product recalls;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; and\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept our current and future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.\nEven when any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payers. Physicians may decide not to recommend our treatments for a variety of reasons including:\n\u25cf timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u25cf demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n\u25cf cost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf limited or no coverage by third-party payers;\n\u25cf convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u25cf restrictions in the label of the drug;\n\u25cf other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and\n\u25cf ineffective marketing and distribution support of its products.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, but fail to achieve market acceptance or such market is smaller than anticipated, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products.\nThe medical device and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we may become the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.\nWe depend extensively on our patents and proprietary technology and the patents and proprietary technology we license from others, and we must protect those assets in order to preserve our business.\nAlthough we expect to seek patent protection for any compounds, devices, biologics, systems, and processes we discover and/or for any specific use we discover for new or previously known compounds, devices, biologics, systems, or processes, any or all of which may not be subject to effective patent protection. In addition, our issued patents may be declared invalid or our competitors may find ways to avoid the claims in the patents.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We are the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of numerous granted United States patents, pending United States patent applications and international patents. The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us are generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, resulting in both an apparent inconsistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in United States patents and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability. Accordingly, patent applications assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not result in patents being issued, any issued patents assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not provide us with competitive protection or may be challenged by others, and the current or future granted patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and achieve profitability.\nMoreover, because some of the basic research relating to one or more of our patent applications and/or patents were performed at various universities and/or funded by grants, one or more universities, employees of such universities and/or grantors could assert that they have certain rights in such research and any resulting products. Further, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights. In addition, as a result of the assertion of rights by a third-party or otherwise, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of others in or outside of the United States. Any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions during our attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending suits brought against us or in connection with patents to which we hold licenses or in bringing suit to protect our own patents against infringement.\nWe depend on license agreements with third-parties for certain intellectual property rights relating to our products and product candidates. In general, our license agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations in order to keep these agreements in effect and retain our rights under them. These payment obligations can include upfront fees, maintenance fees, milestones, royalties, patent prosecution expenses, and other fees. These performance obligations typically include diligence obligations. If we fail to pay, be diligent or otherwise perform as required under our license agreements, we could lose the rights under the patents and other intellectual property rights covered by these agreements. If disputes arise under any of our in-licenses, we could lose our rights under these agreements. Any such dispute may not be resolvable on favorable terms, or at all. Whether or not any disputes of this kind are favorably resolved, our management\u2019s time and attention and our other resources could be consumed by the need to attend to these disputes and our business could be harmed by the emergence of such a dispute.\nIf we lose our rights under these agreements, we might not be able to develop any related product candidates further, or following regulatory approval, if any, we might be prohibited from marketing or commercializing these product candidates. In particular, patents previously licensed to us might, after termination of an agreement, be used to stop us from conducting these activities.\nDue to legal and factual uncertainties regarding the scope and protection afforded by patents and other proprietary rights, we may not have meaningful protection from competition.\nOur long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication, and avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our patent rights and the patent rights of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. Because of this, our pending patent applications may not be granted. These uncertainties also mean that any patents that we own or will obtain in the future could be subject to challenge, and even if not challenged, may not provide us with meaningful protection from competition. Due to our financial uncertainties, we may not possess the financial resources necessary to enforce our patents. Patents already issued to us or our pending applications may become subject to dispute, and any dispute could be resolved against us.\nBecause a substantial number of patents have been issued in the field of alternative drug delivery and because patent positions can be highly uncertain and frequently involve complex legal and factual questions, the breadth of claims obtained in any application or the enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or, to the extent patents have been issued or will be issued, whether these patents will be subject to further proceedings limiting their scope, will provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage, or will be circumvented or invalidated. Several of our currently issued patents have expired or will expire in the next twelve months.\nAlso, because of these legal and factual uncertainties, and because pending patent applications are held in secrecy for varying periods in the United States and other countries, even after reasonable investigation, we may not know with certainty whether any products that we (or a licensee) may develop will infringe upon any patent or other intellectual property right of a third party. For example, we are aware of certain patents owned by third parties that such parties could attempt to use in the future in efforts to affect our freedom to practice some of the patents that we own or have applied for. Based upon the science and scope of these third-party patents, we believe that the patents that we own or have applied for do not infringe any such third-party patents; however, we cannot know for certain whether we could successfully defend our position, if challenged. We may incur substantial costs if we are required to defend our intellectual property in patent suits brought by third parties. These legal actions could seek damages and seek to enjoin testing, manufacturing and marketing of the accused product or process. In addition to potential liability for significant damages, we could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the accused product or process.\nWe may not be able to compete with treatments now being marketed and developed, or which may be developed and marketed in the future by other companies.\nOur products will compete with existing and new therapies and treatments. We are aware of several companies currently seeking to develop alternative means of delivering insulin, as well as new drugs intended to replace insulin therapy at least in part. We are also aware of several companies currently seeking to develop alternative means of enhancing and suppressing peptides. In the longer term, we also face competition from companies that seek to develop cures for diabetes and other malignant, infectious, autoimmune and allergic diseases through techniques for correcting the genetic deficiencies that underlie some of these diseases.\nNumerous pharmaceutical, biotechnology and drug delivery companies, hospitals, research organizations, individual scientists, and nonprofit organizations are engaged in the development of alternatives to our technologies. Some of these companies have greater research and development capabilities, experience, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and managerial resources than we do. Collaborations or mergers between large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with competing drug delivery technologies could enhance our competitors\u2019 financial, marketing, and other resources. Developments by other drug delivery companies could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining FDA approval for products or gaining market acceptance more rapidly than we can.\nSome of our most significant competitors, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and Novo Nordisk, have discontinued development and/or sale of their inhalable forms of insulin. Unlike inhaled insulin formulations, Generex Oral-lyn\u2122 is a buccally absorbed formulation with no residual pulmonary deposition.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and our product candidates may become obsolete.\nThe healthcare industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with other health care management companies for customers across all our services, including MSOs and healthcare providers, such as local, regional, and national networks of physicians, medical groups and hospitals, many of which are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial and other resources, including personnel, than what we have.\nWe are engaged in a rapidly evolving field. Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and research and academic institutions is intense and likely to increase. Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Those companies and institutions also have substantially greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products. We are aware of potential competitors developing products similar to our sarcoma vaccine, ovarian cancer vaccine and pancreatic cancer antibodies product candidates. Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our product candidates less competitive or even obsolete. In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we do, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nDue in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates or those that are in-licensed, and/or we may be unable to pursue the clinical trials that we would like to pursue.\nWe have limited technical, managerial, and financial resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts related to our product candidates. Due to our limited available financial resources, we may have curtailed clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes.\nWe may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus the available resources that we do have. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish. Our decisions to allocate our research, management, and financial resources toward particular indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.\nIf the third parties on which we rely for the conduct of our clinical trials and results do not perform our clinical trial activities in accordance with good clinical practices and related regulatory requirements, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe use independent clinical investigators and other third-party service providers to conduct and/or oversee the clinical trials of our product candidates, and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials. Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the FDA\u2019s requirements and our general investigational plan and protocol.\nThe FDA requires us and our clinical investigators to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval, and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing & Distribution\nWe have limited manufacturing capacity and have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party contract manufacturers to produce our products and clinical development candidates.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our products and candidates, and we currently lack the resources and the capabilities to build our own manufacturing facilities. As a result, we currently rely, and expect to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturers to supply our products and clinical trial supplies. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:\n\u25cf reliance on third-parties for manufacturing process development, regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u25cf limitations on supply availability resulting from capacity and scheduling constraints of third-parties;\n\u25cf the possible breach of manufacturing agreements by third-parties because of factors beyond our control; and\n\u25cf the possible termination or non-renewal of the manufacturing agreements by the third-party, at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.\nIf we do not maintain our key manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increases our costs or deplete profit margins, if any. If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us, and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities.\nThe FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities. The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current FDA Good Manufacturing Procedures (\u201ccGMP\u201d). Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems, leading to drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements. Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA, EMA, and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products following approval.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop our product candidates and commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely basis.\nInterruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business.\nOur suppliers have manufacturing facilities for certain product lines that may be concentrated in one (1) or more plants. Damage to these facilities or issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to quality systems regulations, equipment breakdown or malfunction, among other factors, could adversely affect the availability of our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing of certain products, we may be unable to quickly shift to alternate means of production to meet customer demand. In the event of a significant interruption, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals. We may experience loss of market share, additional expense, or harm to our reputation.\nAdditionally, we contract with a limited amount of suppliers for the raw materials that we use to produce certain products. While we have not experienced a shortage of raw materials in the past and believe that it is unlikely that there will be one in the future, if there were a shortage of raw materials, it could either increase the cost of production or prevent us from being able to produce some of our products, which could adversely affect future results of our operations and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, many of which are administered to or implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable. In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable.\nWhile we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that such coverage is sufficient to cover all product liabilities that we may incur. We are not currently subject to any product liability proceedings, and we have no reserves for product liability disbursements. However, we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future, including product liability claims arising out of the usage and delivery of our products. Should we incur product-related liabilities exceeding our insurance coverage, we would be required to use available cash or raise additional cash to cover such liabilities.\nIf government programs and insurance companies do not agree to pay for or reimburse patients for our pharmaceutical products, our success will be impacted.\nSales of our oral insulin formulation in Ecuador, Lebanon, Algeria and India and our other potential pharmaceutical products in other markets will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement by third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payers often challenge the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Governmental approval of health care products does not guarantee that these third-party payers will pay for the products. Even if third-party payers do accept our product, the amounts they pay may not be adequate to enable us to realize a profit. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before our products are approved for marketing, and any such changes could further limit reimbursement.\nBecause we may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of our products, we may not generate revenues in the amounts we expect, or in the amounts necessary to continue our business. Our existing products as well as our manufacturing facility must meet quality standards and are subject to inspection by a number of domestic regulatory and other governmental and non-governmental agencies.\nAll our proposed and existing products are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) and/or other domestic and international governmental, public health agencies, regulatory bodies or non-governmental organizations. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, and marketing of our products. The process of obtaining required approvals or clearances varies according to the nature of, and uses for, a specific product. These processes can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human or animal clinical trials, sampling activities, and other costly, time-consuming procedures. The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that the authority will grant an approval or clearance for that product. Each authority may impose its own requirements and can delay or refuse to grant approval or clearance, even though a product has been approved in another country.\nThe time required to obtain approval or clearance varies depending on the nature of the application and may result in the passage of a significant period of time from the date of submission of the application. Delays in the approval or clearance processes increase the risk that we will not succeed in introducing or selling the subject products, and we may determine to devote our resources to different products.\nChanges in government regulations could increase our costs and could require us to undergo additional trials or procedures, or could make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all.\nChanges in government regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations because we may have to incur additional expenses if we are required to change or implement new testing, manufacturing and control procedures. If we are required to devote resources to develop such new procedures, we may not have sufficient resources to devote to research and development, marketing, or other activities that are critical to our business.\nWe can manufacture and sell our products only if we comply with regulations and quality standards established by government agencies such as the FDA and the USDA, as well as non-governmental organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (\u201cISO\u201d) and WHO. We have implemented a quality control system that is intended to comply with applicable regulations. Although FDA approval is not required for the export of our products, there are export regulations promulgated by the FDA that specifically relate to the export of our products that require compliance with FDA quality system regulation and that also require meeting certain documentary requirements regarding the approval of the product in export markets. Although we believe that we meet the regulatory standards required for the export of our products, these regulations could change in a manner that could adversely impact our ability to export our products.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to effectively introduce and market our products, which could materially harm our operating results.\nIntroducing and achieving market acceptance for our products will require substantial marketing efforts and will require us and/or our contract partners, sales agents, and/or distributors to make significant expenditures of time and money. In some instances, we will be significantly or totally reliant on the marketing efforts and expenditures of our contract partners, sales agents, and/or distributors. If they do not have or commit the expertise and resources to effectively market the products that we manufacture, our operating results will be materially harmed.\nIn addition to the market success of our products, the success of our business depends on our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity or through borrowing, and we may not be able to raise capital or borrow funds on attractive terms and/or in amounts necessary to continue our business, or at all.\nGeneral Risks\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nPoor or deteriorating economic conditions in the U.S. could adversely affect the demand for healthcare services and consequently, the demand for our products and services. Poor economic conditions also could lead our suppliers to offer less favorable terms of purchase, which would negatively affect our cash flows and profitability. These and other possible consequences of financial and economic decline could have material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters and other catastrophic events, and any disruption to our business resulting from natural disasters would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe operate our business in regions subject to severe weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods, fires, earthquakes, and other catastrophic events. Any natural disaster could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and provide products and services to our customers, and the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption resulting from a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nAlthough we have an ethics and anti-corruption policy in place, and have no knowledge or reason to know of any practices by our employees, agents, or distributors that could be construed as in violation of such policies, our business includes sales of products to countries where there is or may be widespread corruption.\nWe have a policy in place prohibiting employees, distributors and agents from engaging in corrupt business practices, including activities prohibited by the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Nevertheless, because we work through independent sales agents and distributors outside the United States, we do not have control over the day-to-day activities of such independent agents and distributors. In addition, in the donor-funded markets in Africa where we may sell our products, there is significant oversight from the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and advisory committees comprised of technical experts concerning the development and establishment of national testing protocols. This is a process that includes an overall assessment of a product which includes extensive product performance evaluations including five active collaborations and manufacturer\u2019s quality systems, as well as price and delivery.\nWe depend heavily on our executive officers, directors, and principal consultants and the loss of their services would materially harm our business.\nWe believe that our success depends, and will likely continue to depend, upon our ability to retain the services of our current executive officers, directors, principal consultants and others. In addition, we have established relationships with universities, hospitals and research institutions, which have historically provided, and continue to provide, us with access to research laboratories, clinical trials, facilities and patients. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or institutions would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which places restrictions on broker-dealers recommending the stock for purchase.\nOur common stock is defined as \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the Exchange Act Exchange Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder. The SEC has adopted regulations that define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to include common stock that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules include the following requirements:\n\u2022 broker-dealers must deliver, prior to the transaction, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market;\n\u2022 broker-dealers must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer and its registered representative;\n\u2022 broker-dealers must disclose current quotations for the securities;\n\u2022 if a broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer\u2019s presumed control over the market; and\n\u2022 a broker-dealer must furnish its customers with monthly statements disclosing recent price information for all penny stocks held in the customer\u2019s account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nAdditional sales practice requirements are imposed on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. As a result, fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our stock, which could make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is not listed on any national securities exchange. Accordingly, investors may find it more difficult to buy and sell our shares than if our common stock was traded on an exchange. Although our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB, it is an unorganized, inter-dealer, over-the-counter market which provides significantly less liquidity than the Nasdaq Capital Market or other national securities exchange. These factors may have an adverse impact on the trading and price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation could delay or prevent the acquisition or sale of our business.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits our Board of Directors to designate new series of preferred stock and issue those shares without any vote or action by our stockholders. Such newly authorized and issued shares of preferred stock could contain terms that grant special voting rights to the holders of such shares that make it more difficult to obtain stockholder approval for an acquisition of our business or increase the cost of any such acquisition.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on our common stock to date and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our future dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, we currently anticipate that we will retain any earnings to finance our future expansion and for the implementation of our business plan. Investors should take note of the fact that a lack of a cash dividend can further affect the market value of our common stock and could significantly affect the value of any investment in the Company.\nOur issuance of common stock upon exercise of warrants or options or conversion of convertible notes may depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of July 31, 2019, we have 62,290,940 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, outstanding warrants to purchase 15,399,681 shares of common stock, outstanding options to purchase 7,988,675 shares of common stock, and outstanding convertible notes in the amount of $3,944,972, convertible into 2,087,286 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants or conversion of convertible notes could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders, which may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88250, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GNBT"}
