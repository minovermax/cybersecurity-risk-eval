{"cik": "1235468", "company": "LIQUIDITY SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-12-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could suffer. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not in any particular order and are not the only significant risks we may face. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain a supply of surplus assets sufficient to attract buyers to our platform and our ability to successfully attract and retain active professional buyers to create demand for surplus assets sufficient to attract sellers.\nOur ability to increase our revenue and earn profits depends on whether we can successfully retain existing sellers, attract new sellers, expand the supply of merchandise available for sale on our e-commerce marketplaces and attract and retain active professional buyers to purchase the merchandise. Our ability to attract enough quantities of suitable merchandise and buyers will depend on various factors, some of which are out of our control. These factors include our ability to:\n\u2022offer sellers liquid marketplaces for their surplus and salvage assets;\n\u2022offer buyers desirable merchandise;\n\u2022develop and implement effective sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022comply with regulatory and corporate seller requirements affecting marketing and disposition of certain categories of merchandise;\n\u2022efficiently catalogue, handle, store, ship and track merchandise; and\n\u2022achieve high levels of seller and buyer satisfaction.\nFailure to continue to offer competitive products to the marketplace, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, such products, would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not respond to rapid technological changes or upgrade our systems, we could fail to grow our business and our revenue could decrease.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our e-commerce business. As an e-commerce company, we must continuously improve and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure to allow our operations to grow in both size and scope. Without such improvements, our operations might suffer from unanticipated system disruptions, slow transaction processing, unreliable service levels, or impaired quality or delays in reporting accurate financial information, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers. We may also face material delays in introducing new services, products and enhancements. The internet and the e-commerce industry are rapidly changing. If competitors introduce new products and services using new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing websites and our proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete. In addition, the expansion and improvement of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance our business will grow as a result. If we fail to respond to technological change or to adequately maintain, expand, upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure promptly, our ability to grow could be limited and our revenue could decrease.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from our recent initiatives.\nWe expect that our recent initiatives will increase our efficiency and productivity, the functionality of our marketplaces and our cross-selling opportunities, as well as decrease the cost of our systems infrastructure, all of which we expect will drive our scale and growth and have a positive effect on our business, competitive position and results of operations over time. Many of our previous operating and financial systems have been recently replaced, and if these new systems do not operate as expected, we may have to incur significant additional costs and delays to modify them. We cannot assure you that these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent, or within the timeframes, expected, or that the estimated efficiency, cost savings and other improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If our initiatives are not implemented successfully and within budget, or if the new systems, including the new Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system, do not perform in a satisfactory manner, it could disrupt or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as divert management resources. Similarly, if our buyers and sellers fail to accept our new platform or our new unified process for handling transactions across all our marketplaces, it could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe information technology and digital marketing improvements that are core to our RISE strategy place a significant strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources.\nWe continue to decommission non-scalable legacy IT platforms with a singular, modular technology platform with key modules for unified management of sellers and buyers, property handling, transaction processing and finance functions across our entire company. Our new aggregated marketplace, which was launched during Q1 of Fiscal Year 2020 and is presently in a beta phase of testing in order to get customer feedback, is designed to provide our buyers access to all the property available in all our marketplaces, provide a common account experience for sellers and harmonize, simplify and streamline our operations. This program is placing significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance and financial resources and internal financial control and reporting function. Information technology and digital marketing change requires management time and resources to educate employees, redesign internal processes and implement new ways of conducting business. If we do not effectively manage improvements to our new aggregated marketplace, including consolidation of other marketplaces onto our new aggregated marketplace, digital marketing and data driven improvements or the timing, costs, and adoption by sellers and buyers, it could negatively affect our business and our operating results, as well as damage our reputation and our prospects. In addition, the dedication of resources to the continuous improvement of our new aggregated marketplace initiative limits the resources we have available to devote to other initiatives or growth opportunities, or to invest in the maintenance of our internal systems. Further, the timing of completion of various remaining phases of brand phase-outs and transitions to the new aggregated marketplace could be delayed, resulting in higher costs during implementation and greater strain on management time and resources.\nIf we fail to deliver a mobile e-commerce experience that meets our users\u2019 expectations, our business will be adversely affected.\nMobile devices are increasingly used for e-commerce transactions. A significant and growing portion of users access our marketplaces through mobile devices. We may not be able to grow our business as fast as we expect, and we may lose users if we are unable to deliver a mobile e-commerce experience that meets our users\u2019 expectations.\nWe have vendor contracts with Amazon.com, Inc. in our RSCG segment under which we acquire a significant portion of our purchased inventory, and if our relationship with Amazon is disrupted, we would experience a significant decrease in revenue and income.\nWe have multiple vendor contracts with Amazon.com, Inc., under which we acquire then resell merchandise. The property we purchased under these contracts represented approximately 43.6%, 33.7% and 21.8% of cost of goods sold for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If Amazon stopped selling inventory to us on acceptable terms, we likely could not procure alternative inventory from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, and would therefore experience a significant decrease in revenue and have difficulty generating income.\nWe face intense competition.\nOur businesses operate in intensely competitive markets. We have many competitors in different industries, including the online services market for auctioning or liquidating surplus and salvage assets and retail markets. Competitive pressures could affect our ability to attract and retain buyers and sellers, which could decrease our revenue and negatively affect our operating results.\nSome of our other current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger seller and buyer bases, greater brand recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. They may devote greater financial resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, secure better terms from sellers and vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing or inventory availability policies and devote substantially more resources to technology and infrastructure than we do.\nIn some countries, we have competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce. We increasingly may compete in other countries with local competitors that have advantages we do not, such as a greater ability to operate within the local regulatory environment.\nIf our strategy to compete against our many competitors is not effective, we may lose market share and our results of operations may be negatively affected. We may not be able to compete successfully against competitors and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted and we may not be able to achieve long term earnings growth targets.\nIf we do not retain our senior management and other key personnel, we may not achieve our business objectives.\nOur future success, including our ability to successfully implement recent initiatives, depends substantially on the continued service of our senior management and other key personnel, particularly William P. Angrick, III, our Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer. We do not have key-person insurance on any of our officers or employees. Losing any member of our existing senior management team could damage key seller relationships, result in the loss of key information, expertise or know-how, lead to unanticipated recruitment and training costs and make it more difficult to operate our business and achieve our business goals.\nOur operating results depend on our websites, network infrastructure and transaction processing systems, and our software runs on public clouds. Service interruptions or system failures could negatively affect the demand for our services and our ability to grow our revenue.\nAny system interruptions that affect our websites or our transaction systems could impair the services we provide to our sellers and buyers. In addition, our systems and data centers may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of other sources, including:\n\u2022damage to, or failure of, our computer software or hardware, or our connections to, and outsourced service arrangements with, third parties;\n\u2022failure of, or defects in, the third-party systems, software or equipment on which we rely to access our data centers and other systems;\n\u2022errors in the processing of data;\n\u2022computer viruses, malware or software defects;\n\u2022physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, distributed denial of service, or DDoS, penetration attacks, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and\n\u2022telecommunications failures, power outages, pandemics, political unrest, malicious human acts and natural disasters.\nImproving the reliability and redundancy of our systems may be expensive, reduce our margins and may not be successful in preventing system failures.\nOur ability to provide services depends substantially on systems provided by third parties, over whom we have little control. We have occasionally experienced interruptions to our services due to system failures. Any disruption to our data centers, interruptions or failures of our systems or our ability to communicate with third party systems could negatively affect the demand for our services and our ability to grow our revenue.\nWe recently implemented a new e-commerce marketplace and back-office solution to upgrade the information technology systems used to operate our business and replace them with cloud-based solutions. Our new e-commerce marketplace and back-office solution is integrated with our new ERP system. As a result, many of our information technology systems consist of outsourced, cloud-based infrastructure, platform, and software-as-a-service solutions not under our direct management or control. Any disruption to either the outsourced systems or the communication links between us and the outsourced supplier could negatively affect our ability to operate our websites or our transaction systems and could impair our ability to provide services to our sellers and buyers. We may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions.\nOur inability to use software licensed from third parties or our use of open source software under license terms that interfere with our proprietary rights could disrupt our business.\nWe use software licensed from third parties, including some open-source software that we use without charge. We use, among others, the following licensed or open-source software: Microsoft Azure, Microsoft SQL Database, Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Solr Search Engine, HARPROXY Load Balancer, The .net Framework, Linux (an operating system), MySQL (database software), PERL (an interpreter), Apache (a web server), Java, Ruby on Rails, Cold Fusion, Angular, Node, Liferay (content management system), Mule (enterprise service bus), ActiveMQ (message queue), Tomcat (application container), Chef (infrastructure automation), and Jenkins (code deployment), and we may use additional open-source software. Licenses to third party software may not continue to be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with cloud-based services. We rely on outsourced, cloud-based, platform-as-a-service solutions not under our direct management or control.\nOur inability to use third-party software or to enter into agreements on acceptable terms with providers of cloud-based solutions could cause disruptions to our business, or delays in developing future services or enhancements of existing services, which could impair our business. In addition, the terms of certain open source software licenses may require us to provide modified versions of the open source software or any proprietary software that we develop that incorporates all or a portion of the open source software to others on unfavorable license terms consistent with the open source license term. If we must license our proprietary software under the foregoing, our competitors and other third parties could obtain access to our intellectual property, which could harm our business.\nWe are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.\nWe retain highly confidential information on behalf of our buyers and sellers in our systems and databases. Although we maintain security features in our systems designed to protect user information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, such measures cannot provide absolute security and our operations may be susceptible to breaches, including from circumvention of security systems, denial of service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, technical malfunction, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches, system disruptions or other disruptions. For example, in 2018, we experienced a data breach incident that involved an employee\u2019s email account and may have resulted in the exposure of personally identifiable information of our employees. We cannot be certain that the measures and processes taken by us to address this incident will prevent harm to our employees from the incident or prevent all similar events in the future.\nDisruptions from cybersecurity events may jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our systems. An increasing number of websites, including those owned by several other large Internet and offline companies, have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Certain efforts may be state sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources and therefore may be even more difficult to detect. We may not anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. We currently expend, and may be required to expend significant additional capital and other resources, to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to compensate us for any related losses we incur.\nThese issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand our operations. Any breach of our security measures, or even a perceived breach of our security measures, could cause us to lose sellers or buyers, suffer material harm to our business, financial condition, operating results and reputation or be subject to regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, or liability for failure to safeguard our sellers\u2019 and buyers\u2019 information. Further, losing confidential seller or buyer information could also expose us to the risk of liability and costly litigation. In addition, if there is any perception that we cannot protect our users\u2019 confidential information, we may lose the ability to retain existing, and attract new, sellers and buyers, and therefore our revenue could decline.\nShipment of merchandise sold in our marketplaces could be delayed or disrupted by factors beyond our control and we could lose buyers and sellers.\nWe rely upon third-party carriers such as United Parcel Service, or UPS, for timely delivery of our merchandise shipments. We are subject to carrier disruptions and increased costs due to factors beyond our control, including labor difficulties, inclement weather, terrorist activity and increased fuel costs. In addition, we do not have a long-term agreement with UPS or any other third-party carriers, and we cannot be sure that our relationship with UPS will continue on terms favorable to us, if at all. If our relationship with UPS is terminated or impaired or if UPS cannot deliver merchandise for us, we would have to use alternative carriers for the shipment of products to our buyers. We may not be able to engage alternative carriers timely or on terms favorable to us. Potential adverse consequences may include:\n\u2022reduced visibility of order status and package tracking;\n\u2022delays in merchandise receipt and delivery;\n\u2022increased cost of shipment; and\n\u2022reduced shipment quality, which may damage merchandise.\nAny failure to receive merchandise at our distribution centers or deliver products to our buyers in a timely and accurate manner could lead to seller or buyer dissatisfaction and cause us to lose sellers and buyers.\nAn interruption in the operations of our buyer and seller support service system or our distribution centers could significantly harm our business and operating results.\nOur business depends, to a large degree, on the provision of effective support services to our buyers and sellers, and on effective distribution center operations (including leased commercial warehouse distribution space). These operations could be harmed by several factors, including any material disruption or slowdown at our distribution centers resulting from labor disputes, changes in the terms of our underlying lease agreements, telecommunications failures, power or service outages, human error, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other events.\nIf we fail to accurately predict our ability to sell merchandise in which we take inventory risk and credit risk, our margins may decline.\nUnder our purchase transaction model, we purchase merchandise and assume the risk that the merchandise may sell for less than we paid for it. We assume general and physical inventory and credit risk. These risks are especially significant because some of the goods we purchase and resell on our websites are impacted by rapid technological change, obsolescence and price erosion, and because we sometimes make large purchases of particular types of inventory or industrial equipment when manufacturing facilities or campuses close. In addition, we do not typically receive warranties on the merchandise we purchase and, as a result, we must resell or dispose of any returned goods on an as-is basis, which limits the types of buyers willing to purchase our merchandise. Historically, the amount of disposed goods (which includes returned goods we have not resold) has been less than 2% of the goods we have purchased. To manage our inventory successfully, we must maintain enough buyer demand to sell merchandise for a reasonable financial return. We may overpay for the acquired merchandise if we miscalculate buyer demand or the acquired merchandise is not as desirable as we predicted. If merchandise is not attractive to our buyer base, we may have to take significant losses resulting from lower sale prices, which could reduce our revenue and margins. Declines in commodity prices may also reduce the profit we can realize in reselling scrap or salvage assets. For example, we may not sell our scrap or salvage inventory for amounts above its cost and we may incur a loss in products we handle for our commercial sellers.\nOccasionally, in our capital assets marketplace, we make very significant inventory acquisitions, such as the purchase of semi-conductor and oil and gas equipment and biopharma and metal-working machinery, for later resale on our energy and industrial marketplaces. We plan to continue to opportunistically make such acquisitions. The risks described above are heightened in these acquisitions due to their size and, at times, the limited market for the assets we acquire. If we obtain financing to fund such acquisitions, such financing will increase our costs, which will decrease any profits we receive from the sale of the acquired assets.\nAs we grow our business, we may increase the merchandise we purchase directly from sellers, resulting in increased inventory levels and related risks, including increased risk of losses on the sale of the inventory acquired. Any such increase would require the use of additional working capital and any funds so used would not be available for other purposes.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future, which could cause volatility in our stock price.\nOur prior operating results have fluctuated due to changes in our business and the e-commerce industry. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to many factors, including factors beyond our control. You should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance. Factors that may, among others, affect our quarterly operating results include the following:\n\u2022our ability to increase sales to existing buyers, attract and retain new buyers and satisfy buyer demands;\n\u2022our ability to retain and expand our base of sellers;\n\u2022entry into, or the modification, termination or expiration of, material contracts;\n\u2022the volume, size, timing and completion rate of transactions in our marketplaces, including variability due to the timing of large, project-based activities;\n\u2022changes in the supply and demand for and the volume, price, mix and quality of our supply of surplus and salvage assets;\n\u2022introduction of new or enhanced websites, services or product offerings by us or our competitors, which may affect our margins;\n\u2022implementation costs of new contracts, particularly those requiring custom integrations and value-added services;\n\u2022changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022changes in the conditions and economic prospects of the e-commerce industry or the economy generally, which could alter current or prospective buyers' and sellers' priorities;\n\u2022the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages and similar events;\n\u2022event-driven disruptions such as war, terrorism, armed hostilities, disease and natural disasters;\n\u2022changes in energy and commodities prices, including the timing and speed of recovery in energy sector macro conditions;\n\u2022seasonal patterns in selling and purchasing activity; and\n\u2022costs related to acquisitions of technology or equipment.\nOur operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors in some future periods. If this occurs, even temporarily, it could cause volatility in our stock price.\nIf we cannot attract and retain skilled employees, our business may be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees, particularly employees with sales, marketing, operations and technology expertise. Competition for employees in our industry is intense. We have experienced occasional difficulty in attracting the personnel to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties. If we cannot attract, assimilate and retain employees with the skills we require, we may not grow our business and revenue as expected and we could experience increased turnover, decreased levels of buyer and seller service, low morale, inefficiency or internal control failures.\nThe seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations.\nWe experience seasonality in each portion of our business. We expect a disproportionate amount of transactions on our marketplaces to occur at certain times during the year. If we cannot effectively manage increased demand, or the increased flow of goods we typically experience during these times, it could adversely affect our revenue and our future growth. If too many buyers and sellers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from providing efficient service, which may reduce our GMV and the attractiveness of our value-added services. In addition, we may not adequately staff our distribution centers during these peak periods. If we cannot staff warehouses adequately, we may not be able to process surplus assets quickly enough which, in turn, could mean dissatisfaction of sellers and reduced GMV or increased third party storage costs and reduced profitability.\nIf we fail to identify, finance and integrate acquisitions, our future operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have expanded our business in part through acquisitions and may continue to do so in the future. The success of any future growth strategy involving acquisitions will depend on our ability to identify, and the availability of, suitable acquisition candidates. We may incur costs in connection with a potential acquisition but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate the proposed transaction for various reasons. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and operations with our other businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. If we cannot achieve these objectives in a cost-effective and timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or it may take us longer to realize the benefits of the acquisition than we expect. Acquired operations outside the U.S. may present unique challenges or increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes.\nThe integration process could cause the loss of key employees, buyers, sellers or other vendors, increase our operating or other costs, decrease our profit margins or disrupt our other businesses, each of which could impair our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Our efforts to integrate acquired businesses will divert management's attention and resources from our other businesses. Any failure to timely and cost-effectively realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, expenses and operating results.\nAcquisitions could cause dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, one-time write-offs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets. We may not obtain any required acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could make it impossible or costlier to acquire other businesses. If we can obtain financing, the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations. Further, certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, which can be time-consuming and costly to obtain, and the terms of such regulatory approvals may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business.\nDamage to our reputation could harm our business.\nOur positive reputation is based on our core values of integrity, customer focus, relentless improvement, innovation to support leadership, mutual trust and accountability, shared success and doing well and doing good. Our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees, clients and buyers, and to successfully do business would be harmed if our reputation was damaged. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, security breaches, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. Our reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of an affiliate, joint-venture, or a vendor or other third party with which we do business, to comply with laws or regulations. In addition, our reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding us, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine our reputation occur, the additional costs and expenses that we may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the damage to our reputation may adversely affect our earnings and results of operations. Any damage to our reputation could impair our ability to retain existing or attract new customers, investors and employees.\nWe face legal uncertainties relating to the internet in general and to the e-commerce industry in particular and may become subject to costly government regulation.\nThe laws and regulations related to the internet and e-commerce are evolving. These laws and regulations relate to issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, fraud, quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. Laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel and defamation, obscenity and personal privacy could also affect our business. Laws adopted prior to the advent of the internet may not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies and it is not clear how they will apply. Current and future laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business and/or decrease the demand for our services.\nOur auction business may be subject to a variety of additional costly government regulations.\nMany states and other jurisdictions have regulations governing the conduct of traditional \"auctions,\" the liability of traditional \"auctioneers\" in conducting auctions and handling property by \"secondhand dealers\", which may apply to online auction services. In addition, certain states have laws or regulations that expressly apply to online auction services. We expect to continue to incur costs in complying with these laws and could be subject to fines or other penalties for any failure to comply with these laws. We may be required to make changes in our business to comply with these laws, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenue, cause us to prohibit the listing of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in some locations, which may adversely affect our financial condition or operating results.\nIn addition, the body of law regarding the potential liability of an online auction service for the activities of its users is not clear. Users of our websites may not always comply with our terms and conditions or with laws and regulations applicable to them and their transactions. It is possible that we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for any unlawful activities conducted by sellers or buyers. Any costs we incur because of any such allegations, or because of actual or alleged unlawful transactions using our marketplaces, or in our efforts to prevent any such transactions, may harm our opportunities for future revenue growth. In addition, any negative publicity we receive regarding any such transactions or allegations may damage our reputation, our ability to attract new sellers and buyers and our business.\nIn addition, if our sellers violate laws or regulations, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations\nIf we violate increasing levels of regulation relating to privacy, our business could suffer harm.\nWe are subject to regulation at the federal, state and international levels relating to privacy and the use of third-party data, including personal user information and employee data. These statutory and regulatory requirements are evolving, increasing in complexity and number, and may change significantly. How companies collect, process, use, store, share or transmit personal and employee data is subject to increasing scrutiny by governments and the public, which could accelerate the adoption of additional legislation or regulation. New statutory or regulatory developments may restrict our ability to collect and use demographic and personal information from our buyers and our sellers, which could be costly or harm our marketing efforts. Further, there may be conflicts among the privacy and data protections laws adopted by the countries in which we operate. Judicial and regulatory application and interpretation of these statutory and regulatory requirements are often uncertain and may also limit our marketing efforts. Compliance with regulations regarding privacy, security and protection of user and employee data, increased government or private enforcement, and changing public attitudes about data privacy, may increase the cost of growing our business and require us to expend significant capital and other resources. Our failure to comply with these federal, state and international laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, adverse publicity and other costs which could decrease our profitability.\nCertain categories of merchandise sold on our marketplaces are subject to government restrictions.\nWe sell merchandise, such as scientific instruments, information technology equipment and aircraft parts, that is subject to export control and economic sanctions laws, among other laws, imposed by the United States and other governments. Such restrictions include the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic sanctions and embargo laws administered by the Office of the Foreign Assets Control Regulations. These restrictions prohibit us from selling property to (1) persons or entities that appear on lists of restricted or prohibited parties maintained by the United States or other governments or (2) countries, regimes, or nationals that are the target of applicable economic sanctions or other embargoes.\nWe may incur significant costs or be required to modify our business to comply with these requirements. If we are alleged to have violated these laws or regulations we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business\nwith U.S. federal government agencies. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us, whether or not true.\nWe are regularly subject to general litigation and other claims that could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits and other proceedings regarding intellectual property, securities, labor and employment, commercial disputes, the provision of services and other matters. The outcome and impact of such claims, lawsuits and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. It is possible that a resolution of one or more of such proceedings could require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell.\nSome products we sell through our e-commerce marketplaces may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may be the subject of product recalls or other actions. Our exposure to product liability claims may be increased if, for example, the manufacturers of the relevant products do not have enough protection from such claims. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and commitment of other resources, may cause us to incur monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in ways adverse to us. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us against product liability.\nUnfavorable findings resulting from audit or investigation could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions, could negatively impact our future operating results and could force us to adjust previously reported operating results.\nMany of our sellers, including large commercial corporations and federal, state and local governments, have the right to audit our performance under our contracts. Any adverse findings from audits or reviews of our performance could result in a significant adjustment to our previously reported operating results. The results of an audit could significantly limit the volume and type of merchandise made available to us, resulting in lower GMV, revenue and profitability. If such a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, administrative sanctions and could suffer serious harm to our reputation. Government and law enforcement agencies may also investigate our activities under contracts with commercial businesses and federal, state, local and municipal governments. If such an investigation alleges that we engaged in improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies. If, as the result of a government audit or investigation, or for any other reason, we are suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal or other governments generally, or any specific agency, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies is impaired, or if any government otherwise ceases doing business with us or significantly decreases the amount of business it does with us, our revenue and profitability could substantially decrease.\nOur operations are subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-corruption laws of other countries. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials to obtain or retain business or obtain an unfair advantage. Global enforcement of these laws has increased substantially in recent years. Our practices and policies to promote compliance with such laws and regulations may not be effective and violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees or by intermediaries acting on our behalf may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nOur international operations expose us to several risks.\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we may continue to expand internationally, including through acquisitions, organic growth and through joint ventures or strategic alliances with third parties. We are required to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and facilitate the sales of goods and provide services to users worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers, or one or more of our users, or location of the products or service being sold or provided.\nIt is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and websites, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis or at all. In addition to the risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations are subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022local economic and political conditions, or civil unrest that may disrupt economic activity in affected countries;\n\u2022government regulation of e-commerce and other services, competition, and restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization, and restrictions on foreign ownership;\n\u2022restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products and services, including uncertainty because of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, and web services;\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\u2022shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\n\u2022laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\n\u2022lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\n\u2022lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\n\u2022different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils;\n\u2022compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials and other third parties;\n\u2022laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\n\u2022geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.\nIf we expand internationally through joint ventures or strategic alliances, we will also face counterparty risk in addition to the risks described above. If any counterparty to our joint ventures or strategic alliances is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations to us, we may not realize the benefits of such arrangements and we may experience material unanticipated problems, expenses and liabilities.\nIf one or more states assert that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our merchandise or the merchandise of third parties we offer for sale on our websites, our business could be harmed.\nApplying indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, or VAT, goods and services tax, including \u201cdigital services tax\u201d, business tax and gross receipt tax) to e-commerce businesses is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. Often, it is not clear how existing statutes apply to e-commerce services. In addition, governments around the world are looking for ways to increase revenues, which has resulted in legislative action, including new taxes on services and gross revenues and through other indirect taxes. Many transactions occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nWe are required to collect and remit sales taxes under certain agreements that we have with sellers. We also collect and remit sales or other similar taxes relating to shipments of goods into states in which we have a substantial presence. In addition, as we grow our business, any new operation in states in which we do not collect and remit sales taxes could subject shipments into such states to state sales taxes under current or future laws.\nIn June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of South Dakota in a case involving a South Dakota law that requires out-of-state sellers to collect sales tax from South Dakota customers if the sellers satisfy certain thresholds. This decision overrules a previous case that required a company to have a physical presence in a state before it could require tax collection. A number of states have adopted or are considering laws that require marketplace facilitators to collect and remit taxes on behalf of its marketplace sellers. These rules increase our tax compliance costs and risks related to transactions conducted on our marketplaces. Changes in state or federal laws, or our business model, business strategy, or marketing initiatives may require us to collect tax where we do not currently collect such tax. These developments may cause a decrease in future sales, may decrease our ability to compete, increase our compliance costs or otherwise harm our business.\nSimilar issues exist outside of the United States, where the application of VAT or other indirect taxes on e-commerce providers is complex and evolving. For example, we pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases within the various countries in which we operate. Usually, we may reclaim this input VAT from the relevant countries. However, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain. A successful assertion by one or more countries that we may not reclaim VAT could harm our business. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes on our fees and pay taxes on our purchases of goods and services. However, tax authorities may raise questions about our calculation, reporting and collection of taxes and may ask us to remit additional taxes. Should any new taxes become applicable or if the taxes we pay are deficient, our business could be harmed.\nOur international operations expose us to foreign exchange fluctuations that could harm our operations.\nWe conduct business in many countries around the world and receive fees and pay expenses (including salaries to our international workforce) in several different currencies despite reporting our financial results in U.S. dollars. As a result, our financial results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates. The results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from the local currency to US dollars for financial reporting purposes. For example, if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses will result in increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. These factors and others may harm our business and our results of operations. In addition, currency exchange rates may negatively affect our results if we pay for inventory using a different currency than we receive when we sell the inventory.\nFraudulent activities involving our websites and disputes relating to transactions on our websites may cause us to lose sellers and buyers and hurt our ability to grow our business.\nWe periodically receive complaints of fraudulent activities of buyers or sellers on our marketplace, including disputes over the quality of goods and services, unauthorized use of credit card and bank account information and identity theft, potential breaches of system security, and infringement of third-party copyrights, trademarks and trade names or other intellectual property rights. From time to time, we have received complaints that our sellers or buyers trading in our marketplaces are alleged to have engaged in fraudulent or unlawful activity. In addition, we may suffer losses because of purchases paid for with fraudulent credit card data even though the associated financial institution approved payment. If a transaction is disputed, we may not be able to require users of our services to make required payments or to deliver promised goods. We also may receive complaints from buyers about the quality of purchased goods, requests for reimbursement or communications threatening or commencing legal actions against us. Negative publicity generated because of fraudulent conduct by third parties or failure to satisfactorily settle disputes related to transactions on our websites could damage our reputation, cause us to lose sellers and buyers and hurt our ability to grow our business.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we include in our annual report a report containing management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a statement as to whether or not such internal controls are effective. Compliance with these requirements has resulted in, and is likely to continue to result in, significant costs and the commitment of time and operational resources. Recently completed initiatives, as well as other changes in our business, including initiatives to invest in information systems or to transition particular functions to third party providers, have and will necessitate modifications to our internal controls. We cannot be certain that our design for internal control over financial reporting, or any changes to be made, will enable management to determine that our internal controls are effective for any period. If we cannot conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, market perception of our financial condition and the trading price of our stock may be adversely affected, and seller and buyer perception of our business may suffer.\nOur internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents, or by third parties with whom we work. Internal controls may become less effective over time because of, among other things, changes in conditions, failures to comply with our policies and procedures or new business that strains our system of internal controls.\nChanges in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results, which may affect our stock price.\nOur accounting policies are fundamental to determining and understanding our financial results and condition. Some require our management to use estimates and make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Factors may arise over time that lead us to change our estimates and judgments. Sometimes, our management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may cause us to report materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative. Any changes in accounting policies or methods could reduce our net income, which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations. These reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline. For example, our operating results for the year ended September 30, 2019 were affected by the required adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Similar impacts related to changes in accounting policies may occur in the future.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and your investment in our common stock could decline in value.\nThe worldwide financial crisis led to an increase in the overall volatility of the stock market. Despite improved stock market performance, the increased volatility and other broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our\ncommon stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Other factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by us or by a securities analyst who covers our stock;\n\u2022publication of research reports about our company or industry;\n\u2022conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u2022stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those whose business involves the Internet and e-commerce;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts (or the amendment or loss of such contracts), acquisitions, commercial relationships, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements;\n\u2022announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us, our sellers or buyers, or our industry;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022sales of our common stock, including sales of our common stock by our directors and officers or specific stockholders; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of related markets.\nVolatility in the market price of shares may prevent investors from being able to sell their shares of common stock at prices they view as attractive. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources.\nSome provisions of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law inhibit potential acquisition bids that some investors may consider favorable to management.\nOur corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of our company even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022a prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022the authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022advance notice procedures required for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022the requirement that board vacancies be filled by a majority of our directors then in office.\nThese provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. In addition, our bylaws provide that the Delaware Court of Chancery will be the exclusive forum for certain types of legal action (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court within Delaware). This provision may make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to challenge certain corporate actions we take.\nWe may need additional financing in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may need additional funds to finance our operations, as well as to enhance our services, acquire inventory for our businesses, fund initiatives, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or technologies or otherwise support our growth. We may also require additional funds if vendors and other third parties from whom we purchase inventory, other goods or services extend less favorable credit terms to us. Our business may not generate the cash needed to finance such requirements. We do not have a credit facility with third-party lenders from which we may draw funds. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced, and these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. The general economic and capital market conditions in the United States and other parts of the world can deteriorate significantly, limiting access to capital and increasing the cost of capital. A large degree of economic uncertainty remains both domestically and abroad, which can adversely affect access to capital, and the cost of capital. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on\nacceptable terms, our ability to enhance our services, fund strategic initiatives, respond to competitive pressures, take advantage of business opportunities or grow our business would be limited, and we might need to restrict our operations and initiatives.\nWe may not adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could harm our reputation and negatively affect the growth of our business.\nWe regard our intellectual property, particularly domain names, copyrights and trade secrets, as critical to our success. We rely on contractual restrictions and copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights, know-how, information and technology. Despite these protections, a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization or independently develop similar intellectual property.\nWe currently are the registered owners of several Internet domain names, including www.liquidation.com, www.govdeals.com, www.networkintl.com, www.secondipity.com, www.go-dove.com and www.machinio.com. We pursue the registration of our domain names in the U.S. and internationally. We have no patents or registered copyrights. Effective patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and domain name protection are expensive to maintain and may require litigation to enforce. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Our competitors may adopt trade names or domain names similar to ours, impeding our ability to promote our marketplaces and possibly leading to buyer or seller confusion. In addition, we could face trade name, trademark or service mark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered or unregistered trademarks or service marks, including trademarks or service marks that may incorporate variations of our marketplace names. Any claims related to our intellectual property or confusion related to our marketplaces could damage our reputation and negatively affect the growth of our business.\nAssertions that we infringe on intellectual property rights of others could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nThird parties may assert that we have infringed their intellectual property rights in technology or otherwise. We use internally developed systems and licensed technology to operate our online auction platform and related websites. Third parties could assert intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our internally developed systems or use of licensed third-party technology. Third parties also could assert intellectual property infringement claims against parties from whom we license technology. If we are forced to defend against any infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel and/or delays in completion of sales. Furthermore, the outcome of a dispute may require us to change technology, develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. A switch to different technology could interrupt our business. Internal development of a non-infringing technology may be expensive and time-consuming, if we are able to successfully develop such technology at all. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Incurrence of any of these costs could negatively impact our operating results.\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could harm our business.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global and economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions and events, including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to exit the European Union, could have an adverse and negative impact on companies and customers with which we do business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business including by reducing the volume and prices of transactions on our marketplaces. Separately, any factors that reduce cross border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Increasing costs, such as increasing tariffs, would make international trade less profitable and adversely affect our global business.", "PERMNO": 91095, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "LQDT"}
