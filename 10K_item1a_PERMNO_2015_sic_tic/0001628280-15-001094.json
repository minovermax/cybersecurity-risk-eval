Risk Factors\nEconomic Environment\nEconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur business is significantly influenced by economic conditions. Economic growth in the United States remains slow and uneven. High unemployment rates and the failure of our in-school borrowers to graduate are two of the most significant macroeconomic factors that could increase loan delinquencies, defaults and forbearance, or otherwise negatively affect performance of our existing education loan portfolios. Since 2009, the unemployment rate of 20-24 year old college graduates has been higher than historical norms. It reached a high of 13.3 percent in 2011 and declined to 6.6 percent in December 2014. Likewise, high unemployment and decreased savings rates may impede Private Education Loan originations growth as loan applicants and their co-borrowers that experience trouble repaying credit obligations may not meet our credit standards. Current borrowers may experience more trouble in repaying credit obligations, which could increase loan delinquencies, defaults and forbearance. Forbearance programs may have the further effect of delaying default emergence, and alternative payment plans may reduce the utilization of basic forbearance. In addition, some consumers may find that higher education is an unnecessary investment during turbulent economic times and defer enrollment in educational institutions until the economy improves or turn to less costly forms of secondary education, thus decreasing education loan application and funding volumes. Higher credit-related losses and weaker credit quality negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and limit funding options, which could also adversely impact our liquidity position.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a competitive environment. Our product offerings are primarily concentrated in loan and savings products for higher education.\nWe compete in the Private Education Loan market with banks and other consumer lending institutions, many with strong consumer brand name recognition and greater financial resources. We compete based on our products, origination capability and customer service. To the extent our competitors compete aggressively or more effectively, we could lose market share to them or subject our existing loans to refinancing risk. Our product offerings may not prove to be profitable and may result in higher than expected losses.\nIn addition to competition with banks and other consumer lending institutions, the federal government, through the Direct Student Loan Program (\u201cDSLP\u201d), poses significant competition to our Private Education Loan products. The availability and terms of loans the government originates or guarantees affects the demand for Private Education Loans because students and their families often rely on Private Education Loans to bridge a gap between available funds, including family savings, scholarships, grants and federal and state loans, and the costs of post-secondary education. The federal government currently places both annual and aggregate limitations on the amount of federal loans any student can receive and determines the criteria for student eligibility. These guidelines are generally adjusted in connection with funding authorizations from the U.S. Congress for programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Recent federal legislation expanded federal grant and loan assistance, which could weaken the demand for Private Education Loans. The reinstatement of FFELP, or similar federal or state programs which make additional government loan funds available, could decrease the demand for Private Education Loans.\nWe are a leading provider of saving- and paying-for-college products and programs. This concentration gives us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. This concentration also creates risks in our business, particularly in light of our concentrations as a Private Education Loan lender. If population demographics result in a decrease in college-age individuals, if demand for higher education decreases, if the cost of attendance of higher education decreases, if public resistance to higher education costs increases, or if the demand for higher education loans decreases, our ability to grow Private Education Loan originations could be negatively affected. This concentration in our business also subjects us to risks associated with changes in repayment and prepayment rates on Private Education Loans. Most of our Smart Option Education Loan products promote accelerated repayment. Increases in employment levels, wages, family income or alternative sources financing may also contribute to higher prepayment rates.\nAccess to alternative means of financing the costs of education may reduce demand for Private Education Loans.\nThe demand for Private Education Loans could weaken if families and student borrowers use other vehicles to bridge the gap between available funds and costs of post-secondary education. These vehicles include, among others:\n\u2022\nHome equity loans or other borrowings available to families to finance their education costs;\n\u2022\nPre-paid tuition plans, which allow students to pay tuition at today\u2019s rates to cover tuition costs in the future;\n\u2022\nSection 529 plans, which include both prepaid tuition plans and college savings plans that allow a family to save funds on a tax-advantaged basis;\n\u2022\nEducation IRAs, now known as Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, under which a holder can make annual contributions for education savings;\n\u2022\nGovernment education loan programs such as the DSLP; and\n\u2022\nDirect loans from colleges and universities.\nIf demand for Private Education Loans weakens, we would experience reduced demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm our business.\nOur future success depends significantly on the continued services and performance of our management team. We believe our management team\u2019s depth and breadth of experience in our industry is integral to executing our business plan. We also will need to continue to attract, motivate and retain other key personnel. The loss of the services of members of our management team or other key personnel to our competitors or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRegulatory\nFailure to comply with consumer protection laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or litigation, including class actions, and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to a broad range of federal and state consumer protection laws applicable to our Private Education Loan lending and retail banking activities, including laws governing fair lending, unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices, service member protections, interest rates and loan fees, disclosures of loan terms, marketing, servicing and collections.\nViolations or changes in federal or state consumer protection laws or related regulations, or in the prevailing interpretations thereof, may expose us to litigation, result in greater compliance costs, constrain the marketing of Private Education Loans, adversely affect the collection of balances due on the loan assets held by us or by securitization trusts or otherwise adversely affect our business. We could incur substantial additional expense complying with these requirements and may be required to create new processes and information systems. Moreover, changes in federal or state consumer protection laws and related regulations, or in the prevailing interpretations thereof, could invalidate or call into question the legality of certain of our services and business practices.\nFor example, the Bank is currently subject to a Consent Order, Order to Pay Restitution and Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty issued by the FDIC and a Consent Order entered into with the Department of Justice. Specifically, on May 13, 2014, the Bank reached settlements with the FDIC and the Department of Justice regarding disclosures and assessments of certain late fees, as well as compliance with the SCRA.\nViolations of the laws or regulations governing our operations could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or our exclusion from participating in education loan programs. These penalties or exclusions, were they to occur, would impair our business reputation and ability to operate our business. In some cases, such violations may render the loan assets unenforceable.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nIn addition to consumer protection laws, we are also subject to extensive regulation and supervision that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Intended to protect clients, depositors, the DIF, and the overall financial system, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions the Bank can pay to us, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, limit proprietary trading and investments in certain private funds, impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles, among other things. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations, as well as increased intensity in supervision, often impose additional compliance costs. We, like the rest of the banking sector, are facing increased regulation and supervision of our industry by the federal bank regulatory agencies and expect that there will be additional and changing requirements and conditions imposed on us. Effective January 1, 2015, the CFPB became the Bank\u2019s primary consumer compliance supervisor, with consumer compliance examination authority and primary consumer compliance enforcement authority. CFPB jurisdiction could result in additional\nregulation and supervision, which could increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Consent orders, decrees or settlements entered into with governmental agencies may also increase our compliance costs or restrict certain of our activities. Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure is inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Finally, we operate in an environment of heightened political and regulatory scrutiny of student loan lending, servicing and originations, which could lead to further laws and regulations limiting our business.\nRegulatory agencies have increased their expectations with respect to how regulated institutions oversee their relationships with service providers.\nThe CFPB and the FDIC have issued guidance to supervised banks with respect to increased responsibilities to vet and supervise the activities of service providers to ensure compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The FDIC Consent Order of May 13, 2014, among other things, imposes strict requirements on the Bank with respect to oversight of third-party agreements and services. The issuance of regulatory guidance, the FDIC Consent Order, and the enforcement of the enhanced vendor management standards via examination and investigation of us or any third party with whom we do business, may increase our costs, require increased management attention and adversely impact our operations. In the event we should fail to meet the heightened standards for management of service providers, we could in the future be subject to further supervisory orders to cease and desist, civil monetary penalties or other actions due to claimed noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCapital and Liquidity\nFor at least the next several years, our ability to grow our business to its fullest potential will be heavily reliant on our ability to obtain deposits and sell some of the loans we originate.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding or generate sufficient proceeds from loan sales to fund new Private Education Loan originations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe fund Private Education Loan originations through term and liquid brokered and retail deposits raised by the Bank. Assets funded in this manner result in refinancing risk because the average term of the deposits is shorter than the expected term of the Private Education Loan assets we create. Also, our ability to maintain our current level of deposits or grow our deposit base could be affected by regulatory restrictions, including the possible imposition of prior approval requirements or restrictions on deposit growth through brokered deposits. As a supervisory matter, reliance on brokered deposits as a significant source of funding is discouraged. As a result, in order to grow our deposit base, we will need to expand our non-brokered channels for deposit generation, including through new marketing and advertising efforts, which may require significant time, capital, and effort to implement. Further, the significant competition for deposits from other banking organizations that are also seeking stable deposits to support their funding needs may affect deposit renewal rates, costs or availability. If we are unable to develop new channels for deposit generation on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results in operations, and financial position. In addition, our ability to maintain existing or obtain additional deposits may be affected by factors, including those beyond our control, such as perceptions about our financial strength, quality of deposit servicing or online banking generally, with could reduce the number of consumers choosing to make deposits with us.\nUntil such time as our asset base becomes significantly larger, we cannot increase the rate of growth on Private Education Loan originations and remain within FDIC-stipulated annual growth rates on the Bank unless we can sell significant amounts of our loan production in secondary capital markets transactions. There is no assurance that third party sales of our Private Education Loans will be achievable at sufficient levels to make the origination of new Private Education Loans possible or profitable.\nA number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, may adversely affect our loan portfolio funding and disposition activities and thereby adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success may depend on our ability to sell significant numbers of our Private Education Loans, structure securitizations containing those loans or execute other secured funding transactions. Several factors may have a material adverse effect on both our ability and the time it takes us to structure and execute these transactions, including the following:\n\u2022\nPersistent and prolonged disruption or volatility in the capital markets or in the education loan ABS sector specifically;\n\u2022\nOur inability to generate sufficient Private Education Loan volume;\n\u2022\nDegradation of the credit quality or performance of the Private Education Loans we sell to third-parties or to securitization trusts, or adverse rating agency assumptions, ratings or conclusions with respect to those trusts;\n\u2022\nMaterial breach of our obligations to purchasers of our Private Education Loans, including securitization trusts;\n\u2022\nThe timing and size of education loan asset-backed securitizations that other parties issue, or the adverse performance of, or other problems with, such securitizations;\n\u2022\nChallenges to the enforceability of Private Education Loans based on violations of, or subsequent changes to, federal or state consumer protection or licensing laws and related regulations, or imposition of penalties or liabilities on assignees of Private Education Loans for violation of such laws and regulations; or\n\u2022\nOur inability to structure and gain market acceptance for new products or services to meet new demands of ABS investors, rating agencies, or credit facility providers.\nIn structuring and facilitating securitizations of Private Education Loans, administering securitization trusts or providing portfolio management, we may incur liabilities to transaction parties.\nUnder applicable state and federal securities laws, if investors incur losses as a result of purchasing ABS that our securitization trusts issue, we could be deemed responsible and could be liable to investors for damages. We could also be liable to investors or other parties for certain updated information that we may provide subsequent to the original ABS issuances by the trusts. If we fail to cause the securitization trusts or other transaction parties to disclose adequately all material information regarding an investment in any securities, if we or the trusts make statements that are misleading in any material respect in information delivered to investors in any securities or if we breach any other duties as the administrator or servicer of the securitization trusts, it is possible we could be sued and ultimately held liable by an investor or other transaction party. This risk includes failure to properly administer or oversee servicing or collections and may increase if the performance of the securitization trusts\u2019 loan portfolios degrades. In addition, under various agreements, we may be contractually bound to indemnify transaction parties if an investor is successful in seeking to recover any loss from those parties and the securitization trusts are found to have made a materially misleading statement or to have omitted material information.\nIf we are liable to an investor or other transaction party for a loss incurred in any securitization we facilitate or structured and any insurance that we may have does not cover this liability or proves to be insufficient, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe interest rate characteristics of our earning assets do not always match the interest rate characteristics of our funding arrangements, which may increase the price of, or decrease our ability to obtain, necessary liquidity.\nNet interest income is the primary source of cash flow generated by our portfolios of Private Education Loans and FFELP Loans. Interest earned on Private Education Loans and FFELP Loans is primarily indexed to one-month LIBOR rates, but our cost of funds is primarily related to deposit rates. Certain of our Private Education Loans bear fixed interest rates. These loans are not specifically match funded with fixed-rate deposits. Likewise, the average term of our deposits is shorter than the expected term of our Private Education Loans.\nThe different interest rate and maturity characteristics of our loan portfolio and the liabilities funding that portfolio result in interest rate risk, basis risk and re-pricing risk. In certain interest rate environments, this mismatch may compress our net interest margin. It is not possible to hedge all of our exposure to such risks. While the assets, liabilities and related hedging derivative contract repricing indices are typically highly correlated, there can be no assurance that the historically high correlation will not be disrupted by capital market dislocations or other factors not within our control. In these circumstances, our earnings could be materially adversely affected.\nAdverse market conditions or an inability to effectively manage our liquidity risk could negatively impact our ability to meet our liquidity and funding needs, which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and our overall financial condition.\nWe must effectively manage the liquidity risk to which we are exposed. We require liquidity to meet cash requirements such as day-to-day operating expenses, extensions of credit on our Private Education Loans, meet demand for deposit withdrawals and payment of required dividends on our preferred stock. Our primary sources of liquidity and funding are from customer deposits, payments made on Private Education Loans and FFELP Loans that we hold, and proceeds from loan sales and securitization transactions we undertake. We may maintain too much liquidity, which can be costly, or we may be too illiquid, which could result in financial distress during times of financial stress or capital market disruptions.\nUnexpected and sharp changes in the overall economic environment may negatively impact the performance of our loan and credit portfolios and cause increases in our provision for loan losses and charge-offs.\nUnexpected changes in the overall economic environment, including unemployment, may result in the credit performance of our loan portfolio being materially different from what we expect. Our earnings are dependent on the expected future creditworthiness of our education loan customers, especially with respect to our Private Education Loan portfolio. We maintain an allowance for Private Education Loan losses based on expected future charge-offs expected over primarily the next year, which considers many factors, including levels of past due loans and forbearances and expected economic conditions. However, management\u2019s determination of the appropriate allowance level may under- or over-estimate future losses. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if a market risk changes significantly, or if our reserves for credit losses are not adequate, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur use of derivatives to manage interest rate sensitivity exposes us to credit and market risk that could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe maintain an overall interest rate strategy that uses derivatives to minimize the economic effect of interest rate changes. Developing an effective hedging strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates is complex, and no strategy can completely avoid the risks associated with these fluctuations. For example, our education loan portfolio remains subject to prepayment risk that could cause it to be under- or over-hedged, which could result in material losses. In addition, our interest rate risk management activities expose us to mark-to-market losses if interest rates move in a materially different way than was expected when we entered into the related derivative contracts. As a result, there can be no assurance hedging activities using derivatives will effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity, have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition or not adversely impact our liquidity and earnings.\nOur use of derivatives also exposes us to market risk and credit risk. Market risk is the chance of financial loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market liquidity. Some of the swaps we use to economically hedge interest rate risk between our assets and liabilities do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value, called the \u201cmark-to-market,\u201d of these derivative instruments is included in our statement of income. A decline in the fair value of these derivatives could have a material adverse effect on our reported earnings.\nWe are also subject to the creditworthiness of other third parties, including counterparties to derivative transactions. For example, we have exposure to the financial conditions of various lending, investment and derivative counterparties. If a counterparty fails to perform its obligations, we could, depending on the type of counterparty arrangement, experience a loss of liquidity or an economic loss. In addition, we might not be able to cost effectively replace the derivative position depending on the type of derivative and the current economic environment, and thus be exposed to a greater level of interest rate which could lead to additional losses. Our counterparty exposure is more fully discussed in Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Counterparty Exposure.\u201d If our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nDefaults on education loans, particularly Private Education Loans, could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe bear the full credit exposure on Private Education Loans. Delinquencies are an important indicator of the potential future credit performance for Private Education Loans. Our delinquencies, as a percentage of Private Education Loans in repayment, were 2.0 percent at December 31, 2014.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we conformed our policy with that of the Bank to charge off loans after 120 days of delinquency. We also changed our loss confirmation period - the expected time between a loss event and management's estimates of the uncollectability of debt - from two years to one year to reflect both the shorter charge-off policy and its related servicing practices. Prior to the Spin-Off, the Bank sold all loans past 90 days delinquent to an entity that is now a subsidiary of Navient. Post-Spin-Off, sales of delinquent loans to Navient will be significantly curtailed. Similarly, pre-Spin-Off SLM\u2019s Private Education Loan default aversion strategies were focused on the final stages of delinquency, from 150 days to\n212 days. As a result of changing our corporate charge-off policy to charging off at 120 days delinquent and greatly reducing the number of potentially delinquent loans we sell to Navient, our default aversion strategies must now focus more on loans 30 to 120 days delinquent. We have little experience in executing our default aversion strategies on such compressed collection timeframes. If we are unable to maintain or improve on our existing default aversion levels during these shortened collection timeframes default rates on our Private Education Loans could increase.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe evaluation of our allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be subject to significant changes. As of December 31, 2014, our allowance for Private Education Loan losses was approximately $79 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized provisions for Private Education Loan losses of $84 million. The provision for loan losses reflects the activity for the applicable period and provides an allowance at a level that management believes is appropriate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. However, future defaults can be higher than anticipated due to a variety of factors outside of our control, such as downturns in the economy, regulatory or operational changes and other unforeseen future trends. Losses on Private Education Loans are also determined by risk characteristics such as school type, loan status (in-school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), loan seasoning (number of months in active repayment), underwriting criteria (e.g., credit scores), presence of a cosigner and the current economic environment. General economic and employment conditions, including employment rates for recent college graduates during the recent recession, led to higher rates of education loan defaults. If actual loan performance is worse than currently estimated, it could materially affect our estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses in our statements of income and, as a result, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC and the UDFI. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nUnder the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank\u2019s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings and other factors.\nBeginning January 1, 2015, the Bank must comply with the FDIC\u2019s final rule implementing the Basel III capital framework related to regulatory capital measurement and reporting. The rule strengthens both the quantity and quality of risk-based capital for all banks, placing greater emphasis on Tier 1 common equity capital. Under the new rule, well-capitalized institutions will be required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 5 percent, a minimum Tier 1 common equity risk-based capital ratio of 6.5 percent, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital of 8 percent and minimum total risk-based capital of 10 percent. In addition, a capital conservation buffer will be phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, as follows: the maximum buffer will be 0.625 percent of risk weighted assets for 2016, 1.25 percent for 2017, 1.875 percent for 2018 and 2.5 percent for 2019 and beyond, resulting in the following minimum ratios beginning in 2019: a Tier 1 common equity risk-based capital ratio of a minimum 7.0 percent, a Tier 1 capital ratio of a minimum 8.5 percent and a total risk-based capital ratio of a minimum 10.5 percent. As of December 31, 2014, the Bank had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.5 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 15.0 percent and total risk-based capital ratio of 15.9 percent. If the FDIC\u2019s final rule were effective on December 31, 2014, the ratios would be Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.5 percent, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.6 percent and total risk-based capital ratio of 15.5 percent.\nInstitutions that do not maintain the capital conservation buffer could face restrictions on dividend payments, share repurchases and the payment of discretionary bonuses. If the Bank fails to satisfy regulatory capital or leverage capital requirements, it may be subject to serious regulatory sanctions which could also have an impact on us. If any of these sanctions were to occur, they could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nUnfavorable results from ongoing stress tests conducted by us may adversely affect our capital position.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes stress test requirements on banking organizations with total consolidated assets, averaged over the four most recent consecutive quarters, of more than $10 billion. As of December 31, 2014, the Bank has met this asset threshold. Under the FDIC\u2019s implementing regulations, the Bank is required to conduct annual stress tests utilizing scenarios provided by the FDIC and publish a summary of those results. The Bank must conduct its first annual stress test under the rules in the January 1, 2016 stress testing cycle and submit the results of that stress test to the FDIC by July 31, 2016. Published summary results will be required to include certain measures that evaluate the Bank\u2019s ability to absorb losses in severely adverse economic and financial conditions. Our regulators may require the Bank to raise additional capital or take other actions,\nor may impose restrictions on our business, based on the results of the stress tests. We may not be able to raise additional capital if required to do so, or may not be able to do so on terms which are advantageous to us or our current shareholders. Any such capital raises, if required, may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nOperations\nA failure of our operating systems or infrastructure could disrupt our business, cause significant losses, result in regulatory action or damage our reputation.\nOn October 13, 2014, we completed the operational separation of our servicing platforms and personnel from Navient and launched our new customer service operation. One major project remains to be completed before full operational separation from Navient can be achieved: establishing the Bank\u2019s own loan originations platform which we currently expect to achieve sometime in the first half of 2015.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal and regulatory standards and our product specifications, which change to reflect our business needs and new or revised regulatory requirements. As processing demands change and our Private Education Loan portfolio grows in both volume and differing terms and conditions, developing and maintaining our operating systems and infrastructure becomes increasingly challenging. There is no assurance we can adequately or efficiently develop, maintain or acquire access to such systems and infrastructure.\nOur loan originations and conversions of the servicing, financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities that support them may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions. Any such failure could adversely affect our ability to service our clients, result in financial loss or liability to our clients, disrupt our business, result in regulatory action or cause reputational damage. Despite the plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, Internet, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business. Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity, a disruptive event impacting our processing locations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business processes are becoming increasingly dependent upon technological advancement, and we could lose market share if we are not able to keep pace with rapid changes in technology.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to process loan applications and payments in an automated manner with high-quality service standards. The volume of loan originations we are able to process is based, in large part, on the systems and processes we have implemented and developed. These systems and processes are becoming increasingly dependent upon technological advancement, such as the ability to process loans and payments over the Internet, accept electronic signatures and provide initial decisions instantly. Our future success also depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with continuing changes in technology, industry standards and client preferences. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis. We have made, and need to continue to make, investments in our technology platform to provide competitive products and services. If competitors introduce products, services, systems and processes that are better than ours or that gain greater market acceptance, those we offer or use may become obsolete or noncompetitive. Any one of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and ability to obtain and retain clients.\nWe may be required to expend significant funds to develop or acquire new technologies. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors, we could lose market share. We also could lose market share if our competitors develop more cost effective technologies than those we offer or develop.\nWe depend on secure information technology, and a breach of those systems or those of third party vendors could result in significant losses, disclosure of confidential customer information and reputational damage, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal, confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures, our computer systems, software and networks, as well as those of third party vendors we utilize, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, malicious attacks and other events that could have a security impact beyond our control. Our technologies, systems, networks and those of third parties we utilize may become the target of cyber-attacks, malicious code, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, social engineering and physical attacks that could result in information security breaches, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. Moreover, information security risks for large financial\ninstitutions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties.\nIf one or more of such events occur, personal, confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or those of third party vendors, could be jeopardized or could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations that could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We also routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information, some through third parties. We have put in place secure transmission capability, and work to ensure third parties follow similar procedures. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. In the event personal, confidential or other information is jeopardized, intercepted, misused or mishandled, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to fines, penalties, litigation costs and settlements and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. If one or more of such events occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected.\nWe increasingly depend on third parties for a wide array of services, systems and information technology applications, and a breach of service levels, or violation of law by one of these third parties could disrupt our business or provide our competitors with an opportunity to enhance their position at our expense.\nWe increasingly depend on third parties for a wide array of services, systems and information technology applications. Third-party vendors are significantly involved in aspects of our software and systems development, the timely and secure transmission of information across our data communication network, and for other telecommunications, processing, remittance and technology-related services in connection with our business. If a service provider fails to provide the services we require or expect, or fails to meet applicable contractual or regulatory requirements, such as service levels or compliance with applicable laws, the failure could negatively impact our business by adversely affecting our ability to process customers\u2019 transactions in a timely and accurate manner, otherwise hampering our ability to serve our customers, or subjecting us to litigation and regulatory risk for matters as diverse as poor vendor oversight or improper release or protection of personal information. Such a failure could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our networks and services, and the quality of our brands, and could materially adversely affect our revenues and/or our results of operations.\nWe may face risks related to litigation that could result in significant legal expenses and settlement or damage awards.\nNavient has agreed to be responsible, and indemnify us, for all claims, actions, damages, losses or expenses that may arise from the conduct of all activities of pre-Spin-Off SLM occurring prior to the Spin-Off other than those specifically excluded in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, including the settlement or damage awards and legal expenses associated with any litigation arising from most of our pre-Spin-Off activities. Consequently, due to Navient\u2019s indemnification and the smaller, relatively younger vintages of our Private Education Loans, over the near term our litigation-related expenses may be lower than might otherwise be expected. As our business grows, we will likely be subject to claims and litigation, which could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant costs. We are also generally obligated, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify our current and former officers and directors who are named as defendants in these lawsuits. Defending against litigation may require significant attention and resources of management and, regardless of the outcome, such litigation could result in significant legal expenses. If we are a party to material litigation and if the defenses we assert are ultimately unsuccessful, or if we are unable to achieve a favorable settlement, we could be liable for large damages and that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Likewise, similar material adverse effects could occur if Navient is unwilling or unable to honor its indemnification obligations under the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nIncorrect estimates and assumptions by management in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect the reported assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses during the reporting periods. Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses. A description of our critical accounting estimates and assumptions may be found in Part I, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and in Note 2, \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. If we make incorrect assumptions or estimates, we may under- or overstate reported financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating our risk of loss.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, control and report the types of risk to which we are subject. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures, limits and reporting requirements. Management of risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models that we use to mitigate these risks are inadequate, we may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nThe actions required to implement the complete separation of our pre-Spin-Off businesses into two, distinct, publicly traded entities have and will continue to take significant management time and attention and could disrupt operations. Our success is highly dependent on hiring, training and retaining new employees in numbers sufficient to sustain the growth of our business.\nThe complete separation of the pre-Spin-Off organization into two publicly traded companies will continue to require significant ongoing execution and administration at all levels of the internal organization. A team of employees is charged with implementing the Spin-Off, reporting frequently to management on status and progress of the project. High-level employees and management continue to dedicate a significant amount of time to the implementation of the Spin-Off to ensure it is carried out timely and appropriately. We must also hire and train significant numbers of new employees to build out and operate our stand alone operations which could impinge on the time spent on managing our business. Our inability to hire, train, and retain new employees sufficient to support our stand alone operations could disrupt or impair current and future operations.\nWe will incur significant costs in connection with being a stand-alone company and lose the advantage of our larger size and purchasing power that existed prior to the Spin-Off.\nWe will incur significant costs in connection with the transition to being a stand-alone public company and implementing the Spin-Off, including costs to separate information systems, accounting, tax, legal and other professional services costs and recruiting and relocation costs associated with hiring key senior management personnel new to us. In addition, the businesses we operate have historically taken advantage of our larger size and purchasing power prior to the Spin-Off in procuring goods and services. After the Spin-Off, we are no longer able to rely on this purchasing power and, as a result, we may not be able to obtain goods and services from third-party service providers and vendors at prices or on terms as favorable as those we obtained prior to the Spin-Off. Furthermore, prior to the Spin-Off, our businesses have obtained services from, or engaged in transactions with, our affiliates under intercompany agreements. Navient and its affiliates will provide services to us and our affiliates following the Spin-Off under a transition services agreement for a transition period and potentially thereafter. The fees charged by Navient and its affiliates for the provision of these services to us and our affiliates may be higher than those charged prior to the Spin-Off. All of these factors will result in costs that are higher than the amounts reflected in historical financial statements which could cause our profitability to decrease.\nWe continue to have significant exposures to risks related to Navient\u2019s loan servicing operations and its creditworthiness. If we are unable to obtain services, complete the transition of our origination operations as planned, or obtain indemnification payments from Navient, we could experience higher than expected costs and operating expenses and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nAt the time of this filing, our loan origination capabilities continue to be provided by Navient pursuant to a transition services agreement. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and transition services agreement, Navient will also continue to bear significant responsibility for its activities undertaken for the Bank during this transition period. We are continuing to work with Navient to complete an orderly and staged transition to our own separate, stand-alone loan origination platform. Any unexpected delays or additional costs or expenses to complete this transition or to provide the origination activities conducted by Navient on our behalf, whether or not due to Navient\u2019s actions, could significantly affect our operating expenses and earnings.\nNavient has also agreed to be responsible, and indemnify us, for all claims, actions, damages, losses or expenses that may arise from the conduct of all activities of pre-Spin-Off SLM occurring prior to the Spin-Off other than those specifically excluded in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Some significant examples of the types of indemnification obligations Navient has include:\n\u2022\nPursuant to a tax sharing agreement, Navient has agreed to indemnify us for $283 million in deferred taxes that the Company will be legally responsible for but that relate to gains recognized by the Company\u2019s predecessor on debt\nrepurchases made prior to the Spin-Off. The remaining amount of this indemnification receivable at December 31, 2014 is $240 million.\n\u2022\nNavient has responsibility to assume new or ongoing litigation matters relating to the conduct of most pre-Spin-Off SLM businesses operated or conducted prior to the Spin-Off.\n\u2022\nUnder the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Navient is responsible for funding all liabilities under the recently agreed upon regulatory orders with the FDIC and the Department of Justice, other than fines directly levied against the Bank in connection with these matters. Under the Department of Justice order, Navient is solely responsible for reimbursing SCRA benefits and related compensation on behalf of both its subsidiary, Navient Solutions, Inc., and the Bank.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement provides specific processes and procedures pursuant to which we may submit claims for indemnification to Navient and, to date, Navient has acknowledged and accepted all claims. Nonetheless, if for any reason Navient is unable or unwilling to pay claims made against it, our costs, operating expenses and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected over time.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Spin-Off, and the Spin-Off may adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Spin-Off, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Spin-Off is expected to provide the following benefits, among others: (i) a distinct investment identity allowing investors to evaluate the merits, performance, and future prospects of the Company separately from Navient; (ii) separation of responsibility for most pre-Spin-Off activities of Old SLM from the Company (iii) cash flows significantly in excess of preferred stock dividend and debt service obligations; (iv) more efficient allocation of capital for the Company and Navient; (v) reducing the likelihood the Company is designated a systemically important financial institution; and (vi) a separate equity structure that allows direct access by the Company to the capital markets and the use of our equity for acquisitions and equity compensation. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Spin-Off, or if such benefits are delayed, the business, financial condition and results of our operations could be adversely affected and the value of our stock could be impacted.\nSallie Mae and Navient will each be subject to restrictions under a tax sharing agreement between them, and a violation of the tax sharing agreement may result in tax liability to Sallie Mae and to its stockholders.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Navient to preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation and distribution of Navient. Under this tax sharing agreement, both we and Navient will be restricted from engaging in certain transactions that could prevent the Spin-Off from being tax-free to us and our stockholders at the time of the Spin-Off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Compliance with the tax sharing agreement and the restrictions therein may limit our near-term ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in activities that might be beneficial from a business perspective, including M&A transactions. This may result in missed opportunities or the pursuit of business strategies that may not be as beneficial for us and which may negatively affect our anticipated profitability. If Navient fails to comply with the restrictions in the tax sharing agreement and as a result the Spin-Off was determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders at the time of the Spin-Off that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Although the tax sharing agreement provides that Navient is required to indemnify us for taxes incurred that may arise were Navient to fail to comply with its obligations under the tax sharing agreement, there is no assurance that Navient will have the funds to satisfy that liability. Also, Navient will not be required to indemnify our stockholders for any tax liabilities they may incur for its violation of the tax sharing agreement.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur common and preferred stock prices may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nOur smaller market capitalization as compared to pre-Spin-Off SLM;\n\u2022\nChanges in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nOur policy of paying no common stock dividends;\n\u2022\nThe operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including regulatory actions against other financial institutions;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nChanges to the regulatory and legal environment under which we and our subsidiaries operate; and\n\u2022\nDomestic and worldwide economic conditions.\nThe market price of shares of our preferred stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nSignificant sales of our preferred stock, or the expectation of these sales or expectations of same;\n\u2022\nLack of credit agency ratings or FDIC insurance;\n\u2022\nMovements in interest rates and spreads that negatively affect return; and\n\u2022\nCall and redemption features.\nIn addition, when the market price of a company\u2019s common stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A securities class action lawsuit against the Company could cause it to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of its management and other resources, which could materially adversely affect our business, financing condition and results of operations.\nAn investment in our securities is not an insured deposit.\nOur common stock, preferred stock and indebtedness are not bank deposits and, therefore, are not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of securities of any company. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, preferred stock or indebtedness, you may lose some or all of your investment.\nThe holders of our preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had issued and outstanding 3.3 million shares of our 6.97 percent Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series A and 4 million shares of our Floating-Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B.\nOur preferred stock is senior to our shares of common stock in right of payment of dividends and other distributions. We must be current on dividends payable to holders of preferred stock before any dividends can be paid on our common stock. In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of our preferred stock must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our common shareholders.\nWe do not intend pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock since the Spin-Off and we do not expect to do so for the foreseeable future. We are dependent on funds obtained from the Bank to fund our obligations. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. In particular, the Bank is subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to us, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws, regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations. The FDIC has the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including us and our bank subsidiaries.\nRestrictions on Ownership\nThe ability of a third party to acquire us is limited under applicable U.S. and state banking laws and regulations.\nUnder the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, (\u201cCIBC Act\u201d), the FDIC\u2019s regulations thereunder, and similar Utah banking laws, any person, either individually or acting through or in concert with one or more other persons, must provide notice to, and effectively receive prior approval from, the FDIC and UDFI before acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d of us. In practice, the process for obtaining such approval is complicated and time-consuming, often taking longer than six months, and a proposed acquisition may be disapproved for a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: antitrust concerns, financial condition and managerial competence of the applicant, and failure of the applicant to furnish all required information. Under the FDIC\u2019s CIBC Act regulations, control is rebuttably presumed to exist, and notice is required, where a person owns, controls\nor holds with the power to vote 10 percent or more of any class of our voting shares and no other person owns, controls or holds with the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting shares.", "PERMNO": 66325, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "SLM"}
