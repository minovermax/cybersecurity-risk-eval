In particular, the Higher Education Act, as amended and reauthorized from time to time, and related regulations impose significant regulatory scrutiny on Capella University, and all other higher education institutions that participate in the various federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (Title IV programs). The Higher Education Act, as reauthorized, mandates specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following components of the higher education regulatory triad: (1) the federal government through the U.S. Department of Education; (2) independent accrediting agencies recognized by the Department of Education; and (3) state higher education regulatory bodies.\nIn 2017, Capella University derived 75.53% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV programs, administered by the U.S. Department of Education. A significant percentage of our learners rely on the availability of Title IV program funds to cover their cost of attendance at Capella University and related educational expenses.\nThe applicable regulatory requirements cover virtually all phases of our operations, including educational program offerings, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing and recruiting, financial operations, processing refund payments to the U.S. Department of Education (the Department of Education) for withdrawn learners, commencement of new educational programs, and changes in our corporate structure and ownership.\nThe regulations, standards and policies of the various regulatory agencies frequently change and are subject to interpretative uncertainty, particularly where they are crafted for traditional schools rather than our on-line academic delivery model. Changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, or standards could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under Title IV programs, or costs of doing business. In addition, the development of new avenues of academic and financial resources for learners, such as the University\u2019s implementation of the non-term borrower-based academic year for direct assessment programs, may give rise to unpredictability with regard to application of evolving regulatory standards. We cannot predict how all of the requirements applied by these agencies will be interpreted or whether we will be able to comply with these requirements in the future.\nIf we are found to be in noncompliance with any applicable regulations, standards or policies, any one of the relevant regulatory agencies may be able to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nImpose monetary fines or penalties;\n\u2022\nLimit or terminate our operations or ability to grant degrees and diplomas;\n\u2022\nRestrict or revoke our accreditation, licensure or other approvals to operate;\n\u2022\nLimit, suspend or terminate our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nRequire repayment of funds received under Title IV programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nRequire us to post a letter of credit with the Department of Education;\n\u2022\nSubject us to heightened cash monitoring by the Department of Education;\n\u2022\nTransfer us from the Department of Education's advanced system of receiving Title IV program funds to its reimbursement system, under which an institution must disburse its own funds to learners and document the learners' eligibility for Title IV program funds before receiving such funds from the Department of Education;\n\u2022\nSubject us to other civil or criminal penalties; and/or\n\u2022\nSubject us to other forms of censure.\nAny of the penalties, injunctions, restrictions or other forms of censure listed above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we lose our Title IV eligibility, we would experience a dramatic and adverse decline in revenue and we would be unable to continue our business as it currently is conducted.\nRulemaking by the U.S. Department of Education, or future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, the Department of Education engages in rulemaking which can materially affect our business. Additionally, from time to time the Department of Education issues new guidance on, or interpretations of, existing regulations. The Department of Education has promulgated or engaged in rulemaking on substantive matters in the past two years that impact our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nOn October 12, 2016, the Department of Education released final Teacher Preparation regulations to provide transparency around initial teacher preparation programs. This rule requires institutions with initial teacher licensure programs to report outcomes to the state and ties Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) funds to programs shown to be effective via this required reporting. Capella University ended its participation in the TEACH Grant Program effective in October 2016. The published final rules were to be effective July 1, 2017; however, in early 2017, the United States Congress invoked the Congressional Review Act authority to overturn this regulation, which was signed into law by President Trump in March 2017.\n\u2022\nThe Department of Education published final rules on November 1, 2016 which set forth expanded criteria, and substantial discretion for the Department of Education, with respect to borrower rights and relief in defense to repayment of Title IV loans. In particular, for recipients of loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, the rule permits student loan debt relief, upon borrower application, where there is:\n\u25e6\nState or Federal court or administrative tribunal judgment against a school related to the loan or the educational services for which the loan was made;\n\u25e6\nBreach of contract; or\n\u25e6\nSubstantial misrepresentation by the school.\nThe regulation grants the Department of Education broad discretion to determine whether a school has committed a breach of contract or substantial misrepresentation, to allow group claims, which may include individuals who have not applied to the Department of Education seeking relief, and to determine when to seek recoupment from the school upon loan discharge. In addition, the final rules expand the events triggering a determination that an institution is unable to meet its financial or administrative obligations to include certain automatic triggers, such as failure to satisfy the 90/10 regulation in the most recent fiscal year, a cohort default rate in excess of 30 percent in the two most recent years, and failure to comply with certain SEC requirements, as well as discretionary triggers such as certain federal, and private actions, unspecified dropout rates, unspecified fluctuations in Title IV funding, and actions by the school\u2019s accreditor. In the event of such a triggering event, an institution may become ineligible for Title IV funds or be required to post a letter of credit in the amount of at least 10% of the school\u2019s annual Title IV disbursements for each triggering event, and make disclosure to learners and prospective learners. In addition, the rule increases access to closed school discharges and prohibits the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements. Finally, the rule makes other conforming and technical changes to repayment plans and loan consolidation.\nAlthough this rule was slated to go into effect July 1, 2017, on June 16, 2017, the Department of Education announced an indefinite postponement of the Borrower Defense to Repayment regulation. On the same day, the Department of Education announced its intent to establish rulemaking committees to develop proposed revisions to the existing gainful employment regulation as well as the Borrower Defense to Repayment regulation. The Department of Education conducted public hearings on Gainful Employment and Borrower Defense to Repayment on July 10 and July 12, 2017, in addition to soliciting written comments on both topics. Capella University submitted comments on July 12, 2017. The Borrower Defense to Repayment negotiated rulemaking committee met in November 2017, as well as in January and February 2018, and wrapped up negotiations without reaching consensus, freeing the Department of Education to draft a rule without including input from the committee. The Gainful Employment negotiated rulemaking committee met in December 2017 and February 2018 and will meet again in March 2018. The Department of Education has indicated it intends to release final rules addressing both Borrower Defense to Repayment and Gainful Employment by November 1, 2018, to go into effect July 1, 2019.\n\u2022\nOn December 16, 2016, the Department of Education published final rules on State Authorization of Postsecondary Distance Education and Foreign Locations. These rules require institutions offering distance education or correspondence courses to be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state, including via a state reciprocity agreement. In 2015, Capella University became an institutional member of SARA. The Department of Education has indicated they plan to issue formal guidance clarifying that SARA meets the definition of state authorization reciprocity agreement as included in the final regulation. Also included in the final rules are a number of general and individualized disclosures for prospects and learners including how programs are authorized, complaint processes, adverse actions by state and accrediting agencies, refund policies,\nand prerequisites for licensure or certification for certain programs. The new State Authorization regulations become effective July 1, 2018.\nThese regulations may increase our operating costs and in some cases require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. New or amended regulations, guidance or interpretations in the future could further negatively impact our business.\nApplication and discharge of learner Title IV debt under the new Borrower Defense to Repayment regulation could result in increased litigation and monetary losses, and could trigger Title IV ineligibility or require us to post letters of credit.\nIn the event the Borrower Defense to Repayment regulation becomes effective in its current form, borrowers will have access to a new application process designed to lead to discharge of loans for eligible borrowers. In the event the Department of Education were to grant relief from repayment to one or more Capella University learners, the Department of Education may seek recoupment of the losses incurred based on the borrower\u2019s defense, which would result in financial losses for Capella University. The availability of this relatively informal avenue to relief, with substantial Department of Education adjudicatory discretion, may lead to an increase in the volume of learners seeking relief, both through the Department of Education as well as through litigation or other agencies. In addition, under the new financial responsibility rules, repayments to the Department of Education under the borrower defense to repayment regulation could render Capella University unable to meet its financial or administrative obligations for Title IV eligibility or require letters of credit, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with U.S. Department of Education rules regarding incentive compensation could result in monetary penalties and sanctions.\nAn institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or admissions or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based in any part, directly or indirectly, on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. Failure to comply could result in monetary penalties and/or sanctions imposed by the Department of Education, which could result in lower enrollments, revenue, and net operating income. The law and regulations governing this requirement do not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, creating uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation, rendering development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish.\nFailure to comply with new U.S. Department of Education rules regarding Gainful Employment (GE) could result in significant adverse consequences, including ineligibility for our learners to participate in Title IV programs.\nUnder the Higher Education Act, as reauthorized, proprietary institutions are generally eligible to participate in Title IV programs only for educational programs that lead to \u201cgainful employment in a recognized occupation.\u201d\nIn connection with this requirement, proprietary postsecondary institutions are required to disclose to prospective students each eligible program\u2019s recognized occupations, cost, completion rate, job placement rate, and median loan debt of program completers. These reporting requirements increase our costs of operations and could adversely impact student enrollment, persistence and retention if our reported program information compares unfavorably with other reporting educational institutions.\nThe final rule went into effect on July 1, 2015. It applies to all GE programs, which include all programs offered by proprietary institutions. Under the rule, the continued eligibility of GE programs to participate in Title IV programs is based on the programs\u2019 performance against the following Debt-to-Earnings (DTE) measures:\n\u2022\nPass: Programs whose graduates have annual loan payments less than 8% of total earnings, OR less than 20% of discretionary earnings.\n\u2022\n\u201cZone\u201d: Programs that do not pass and whose graduates have annual loan payments between 8% and 12% of total earnings, OR between 20% and 30% of discretionary earnings.\n\u2022\nFail: Programs whose graduates have annual loan payments greater than 12% of total earnings AND greater than 30% of discretionary earnings.\n\u2022\nIneligible: Programs that fail in 2 out of any 3 consecutive years OR have a combination of zone and failing DTE rates for four consecutive years for which DTE rates are calculated.\nEarnings are calculated by the Department of Education using Social Security Administration (SSA) data. Earnings information is then aggregated and made available to institutions. In January 2017, we received final DTE ratios from the Department of Education for the first measurement year. The DTE ratios we received showed that none of our programs were determined to \u201cFail.\u201d This is significant because the rules state that a program would be ineligible for Title IV funds in the next year if it Failed in two out of three consecutive years, whereas for a program in the Zone, a program would be ineligible for Title IV funds in the next year only if it were in the Zone (or Failed) in each of four consecutive years. The initial DTE ratio information we received reflected one of our programs (the Master's of Science in Marriage and Family Counseling/Therapy program) was in the Zone. Since January 2017, we have not received any additional DTE ratios from the Department of Education for periods subsequent to the first measurement year. We have taken and continue to take steps to avoid or mitigate potential adverse consequences of the DTE ratio rules. Despite our efforts, it remains possible that one or more of our programs could be determined to be in the \u201cZone\u201d or \u201cFail\u201d in future calculations.\nIf a program fails or is in the zone for draft DTE rates during the transition period, the Department of Education will calculate transitional draft DTE rates using the median loan debt of the students who completed the program during the most recently completed award year and the earnings used to calculate the draft DTE rates. The final DTE rate for purposes of any sanctions will be the lower of the draft or transitional DTE rate. The transition period is five years for programs with durations of one year or less, six years for programs between one and two years in length, and seven years for programs of more than two years.\nIf a GE program could become ineligible in the subsequent award year based on its DTE metrics, the institution is required to inform students and prospective students that the program could lose Title IV eligibility. The warning must state that the program has not passed standards established by the Department of Education, based on amounts students borrow for enrollment in the program and their reported earnings. The warning must also inform students that if the program does not pass the standards in the future, students who are then enrolled may not be able to use federal student grants or loans to pay for the program.\nThe final rule also requires institutions to provide certifications regarding a GE program\u2019s satisfaction of programmatic accreditation and state licensure requirements as part of the institutional program participation agreements with the Department of Education. The certification requirements went into effect on December 31, 2015 in connection with the Department of Education's program participation agreement recertification; however, new programs introduced between July 1 and December 31, 2015 were to be certified prior to such program\u2019s introduction to establish eligibility for Title IV federal financial aid. We worked with the Department of Education to clarify various issues related to the new certification requirements, and certified our programs as required by the final GE rule and requirements of the Department of Education.\nUnder the final GE rule, the continuing eligibility of our educational programs for Title IV program funding is at risk due to factors beyond our control, such as changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income, changes in the percentage of our former students who are current in repayment of their student loans, and other factors.\nIn addition, if we are required to include a warning notice for any of our programs based on the debt service-to-earnings ratios, enrollment in those programs may decline significantly. The inclusion of a required warning could affect the continuation of the affected programs even if students in the programs are still eligible to participate in Title IV aid programs.\nThe final rule also includes requirements for the reporting of learner and program data by institutions to the Department of Education. The rule makes other conforming and technical revisions to the Title IV program participation agreement and related regulations. On June 30, 2017, the Department of Education announced that enforcement of certain expanded disclosure and distribution requirements under the current final rule will be postponed until July 1, 2018.\nOn June 16, 2017, the Department of Education announced its intention to establish a rulemaking committee to examine and revise the Gainful Employment regulation, which it called \"overly burdensome and confusing for institutions of higher education.\" The Department of Education conducted public hearings on Gainful Employment and Borrower Defense to Repayment on July 10 and July 12, 2017, in addition to soliciting written comments on both topics. Capella submitted comments on July 12, 2017. The Gainful Employment negotiated rulemaking committee met in December 2017 and February 2018, and will meet again in March 2018. The Department of Education intends to publish final rules by November 1, 2018, to go into effect July 1, 2019\nIf Capella University does not maintain its registration in Minnesota, it may not operate or participate in Title IV programs or operate in a number of other states.\nAn institution that grants degrees, diplomas or certificates must be authorized by the relevant education agency of the state in which it is located. Capella University is deemed to be located in the State of Minnesota and is registered with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (MOHE). Minnesota registration is also required for our learners to be eligible to receive funding under Title IV programs. Such registration may be lost or withdrawn if Capella University fails to submit renewal applications and other required submissions to the state in a timely manner, or if Capella University fails to comply with material requirements under Minnesota statutes and rules for continued registration. Loss of state registration of Capella University from the Minnesota Office of Higher Education would terminate our ability to provide educational services as well as our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Capella University must also remain in good standing with MOHE to obtain and maintain authorization or licensure to operate in states outside of Minnesota. On October 13, 2016, Capella University received a request for information from MOHE related to its doctoral programs and complaints filed by doctoral learners. The Company provided data and information in response to MOHE\u2019s request, along with additional clarifying and supplemental information. According to the original 2016 request, MOHE is completing program reviews of all online doctoral programs for institutions registered in Minnesota in an effort to better understand the context, background, and issues related to doctoral student complaints. Should our registration with MOHE be terminated, our ability to operate in other states would also cease, and it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn 2017, the Minnesota legislature promulgated revisions to the Act, which clarify MOHE\u2019s authority and processes related to student complaints. Among other revisions, the legislation specifies that if violations of the Act are found, then MOHE may require remedial action by the school or assign a penalty, and that remedial action may include student notifications of violations, adjustments to university policies and procedures and tuition refunds to impacted students. The full impact of the legislation cannot be predicted and will depend upon the manner in which MOHE interprets and applies the process set forth in the statue.\nOur failure to comply with state authorization requirements or other regulations of various states could result in actions that would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations.\nWe must be authorized to operate or otherwise certified to enroll students by the appropriate post-secondary regulatory authority in each state where we conduct activities that require authorization, or be exempt from such regulatory authorization, usually based on recognized accreditation. On January 27, 2015, the State of Minnesota joined the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA), and on March 6, 2015, Capella University was approved as an institutional participant in SARA. SARA is a voluntary agreement among member states and U.S. territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance-education courses and programs. It is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by postsecondary institutions based in another state. Capella University is authorized to operate in SARA member-states under the terms of the Agreement.\nAs of July 1, 2017, California requires registration with the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (\u201cBPPE\u201d), and Capella has filed its BPPE registration application. Capella University has obtained state-specific regulatory approval to operate in all other states that require such authorization. For example, in some states the higher educational agency may require Capella University to be licensed or authorized because we enroll learners who reside in the state. In other cases, licensure or authorization is required because our recruiters meet with prospective learners in the state. In addition to Minnesota, we are licensed or authorized to operate or certified to offer degree programs in all SARA member-states. Capella University is formally licensed or authorized to operate in these states because we have determined that our activities in each state constitute a presence that requires licensure or authorization by these states' higher educational agencies. In some cases, the licensure or authorization is only for specific programs or specific activities. Because Capella University enrolls learners from each of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, and because we may undertake activities in other states that constitute a presence or otherwise subject us to the jurisdiction of the respective state educational agency, we may need to seek licensure or authorization to operate in additional states. Additionally, state regulations in states in which we are not licensed may limit certain of our activities, such as residencies and internships in programs requiring those experiences. If we lose any of our approvals or experience a delay in obtaining or cannot obtain these approvals or evidence such approvals are not necessary, we may be unable to enroll learners in impacted states, and our business could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe are in a period in which many states are reevaluating and revising their authorization regulations, especially as applied to distance education. This increased review and scrutiny has increased uncertainty regarding our regulatory status and ability to offer programs in certain states. If these pressures and uncertainty continue in the future, they could have a material impact on our enrollments, revenue, results of operations and cash flow. If we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements, we may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization. Loss of authorization in one or more states could\nincrease the likelihood of additional scrutiny and potential loss of operating and/or degree granting authority in other states in which we operate, which would further impact our business.\nWe are subject to extensive regulations by the states in which we are authorized or licensed to operate. State laws typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and other operational matters. State laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award degrees. Some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the Department of Education. We are required to post surety bonds in several states. If we fail to comply with state licensing requirements, we may lose our state licensure or authorizations. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Minnesota Office of Higher Education could result in Capella University losing its registration with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education, its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or its ability to offer certain programs, any of which would have a material impact on our operations.\nAttorneys General in several states have become more active in enforcing consumer protection laws, especially related to recruiting practices and the financing of education at proprietary educational institutions. In addition, several Attorneys General have partnered with the Federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission to review industry practices. Recent litigation initiated by Attorneys General and the Federal Trade Commission against other proprietary educational institutions increases the likelihood of scrutiny of the marketing and advertising practices of educational institutions, and therefore increases risk. If our past or current business practices at Capella University are found to violate applicable consumer protection laws or advertising regulations, we could be subject to monetary fines or penalties and possible limitations on the manner in which we conduct our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that more federal agencies or states commence such investigations or multiple states act in a concerted manner, the cost of responding to these inquiries and investigations could increase significantly and the potential impact on our business would be substantially greater.\nThe inability of our graduates to obtain licensure or other specialized outcomes in their chosen professional fields of study could reduce our enrollments and revenues, and potentially lead to litigation that could be costly to us.\nCertain of our graduates seek professional licensure or other specialized outcomes in their chosen fields following graduation. Their success in obtaining these outcomes depends on several factors, including the individual merits of the learner, but also may depend on whether the institution and the program were approved by the state or by a professional association, whether the program from which the learner graduated meets all state requirements and whether the institution is accredited. Certain states have refused to license or certify learners from particular Capella University programs because the programs did not meet one or more of the state\u2019s specific licensure requirements or were not approved by the state for purposes of professional licensure. In addition, professional associations may refuse to certify specialized outcomes for our learners for similar reasons. We have had to respond to claims brought against us by former learners as a result of such refusals. For instance, certain states have denied our graduates professional licensure because the Capella University program from which they graduated did not have a sufficient number of residency hours, did not include a state-approved clinical program, did not satisfy state coursework requirements, or was not accredited by a specific third party (such as the American Psychological Association). The state requirements for licensure are subject to change, as are the professional certification standards, and we may not immediately become aware of changes that may impact our learners in certain instances. In the event that one or more states refuses to recognize our learners for professional licensure, and/or professional associations refuse to certify specialized outcomes for our learners, based on factors relating to our institution or programs, the potential growth of our programs would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be exposed to litigation that would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAction by the U.S. Congress to revise the laws governing the federal student financial aid programs or reduce funding for those programs, including changes applicable only to proprietary educational institutions, could reduce our learner population and increase our costs of operation.\nThe U.S. Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program. The Higher Education Act (HEA) was last reauthorized in 2008 by the Higher Education Opportunity Act. It currently is unclear when the HEA will be reauthorized. Changes to the HEA, including changes in eligibility and funding for Title IV programs, are likely to occur in subsequent reauthorizations, but we cannot predict the scope or substance of any such changes.\nIn recent years, there has been increased focus by Congress on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education. We cannot predict what legislation, if any, may emanate from Congressional committee hearings or what impact any such legislation might have on the proprietary education sector and our business in particular.\nAny action by Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding through across-the-board funding reductions, or otherwise, or materially impacts the eligibility of our institutions or students to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on our enrollment, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Congressional action could also require us to modify our practices, for instance by reducing our marketing expenses or otherwise modifying our marketing practices, in ways that increase our administrative costs and reduce our enrollment and operating income.\nWe would lose our eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of our revenues derived from those programs is too high, in which event we could not conduct our business in its present form.\nA requirement of the Higher Education Act, as reauthorized by the Higher Education Opportunity Act, commonly referred to as the \u201c90/10 Rule\u201d, applies only to proprietary institutions of higher education, which includes Capella University. Under this rule, a proprietary institution will be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs if for any two consecutive fiscal years it derives more than 90% of its cash basis revenue, as defined in the rule, from Title IV programs. An institution that derives more than 90% of its revenue from Title IV programs for any single fiscal year will be automatically placed on provisional certification for two fiscal years and will be subject to possible additional sanctions determined to be appropriate under the circumstances by the U.S. Department of Education in the exercise of its broad discretion. While the Department of Education has broad discretion to impose additional sanctions on such an institution, there is only limited precedent available to predict what those sanctions might be, particularly in the current regulatory environment. The Department of Education could specify any additional conditions as a part of the provisional certification and the institution\u2019s continued participation in Title IV programs. These conditions may include, among other things, restrictions on the total amount of Title IV program funds that may be distributed to learners attending the institution; restrictions on programmatic and geographic expansion; requirements to obtain and post letters of credit; additional reporting requirements to include additional interim financial reporting; or any other conditions imposed by the Department of Education. Should an institution be subject to a provisional certification at the time that its current program participation agreement expired, the effect on recertification of the institution or continued eligibility in Title IV programs pending recertification is uncertain. An institution that derives more than 90% of its revenue from Title IV programs for two consecutive fiscal years will be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years. Capella University is required to calculate this percentage at the end of each fiscal year; as of December 31, 2017, our percentage was 75.53% of Capella University revenues. If an institution is determined to be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs due to the 90/10 Rule, any disbursements of Title IV program funds while ineligible must be repaid to the Department of Education.\nThe 90/10 Rule percentage for Capella University could increase in the future depending on the degree to which our various initiatives are effective, the impact of future changes in our enrollment mix, and regulatory and other factors outside our control, including any reduction in government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, or changes in the treatment of such funding for purposes of the 90/10 Rule calculation. Currently, tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, is not treated as Title IV revenue under the 90/10 Rule and, therefore, based on the prescribed order of application per the regulations, a majority of such funding is included in the \u201c10%\u201d portion of the rule calculation. A reduction in the availability of this type of funding, or a change (through either legislation or executive order) that requires that it be treated in the same manner as Title IV funding under the 90/10 Rule, would increase our 90/10 Rule percentage.\nAny necessary further efforts to reduce the 90/10 Rule percentage for Capella University, especially if the percentage exceeds 90% for a fiscal year, may involve taking measures which reduce our revenue, increase our operating expenses, or both, in each case perhaps significantly. If the 90/10 Rule is not changed to provide relief for institutions like Capella University, we may be required to make structural changes to our business in order to remain in compliance. These changes may materially alter the manner in which we conduct our business and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAn increase in our student loan default rates could result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nTo remain eligible to participate in Title IV programs, educational institutions must maintain student loan cohort default rates below specified levels. The U.S. Department of Education reviews an educational institution\u2019s cohort default rate annually as a measure of administrative capability. Each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (ending September 30). For each federal fiscal year, the cohort default rate is calculated for each institution with 30 or more borrowers entering repayment in a given federal fiscal year by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year default by the end of the second following federal fiscal year. The cohort default rates are published by the Department of Education approximately 12 months after the end of the measuring period. Thus, in September 2017, the Department of Education published the three-year cohort default rates for the\n2014 cohort, which measured the percentage of students who first entered into repayment during the year-ended September 30, 2014 and defaulted prior to September 30, 2016. Capella University's three-year cohort default rates for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 cohorts are 6.9%, 6.5%, and 8.9%, respectively. If an institution\u2019s three-year cohort default rate exceeds 30% for three consecutive years or 40% for any given year, it will be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and, as a result, its students would not be eligible for federal student financial aid.\nIf the Department of Education suspends or terminates our certification, we would lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nCapella University is fully certified through June 30, 2020 to participate in the Title IV programs. The Department of Education may also review our continued certification to participate in Title IV programs in the event we expand our activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location or, in certain cases, if we modify the academic credentials that we offer. The Department of Education could limit, suspend or terminate our participation in Title IV programs for violations of the Higher Education Act or Title IV regulations. Title IV eligibility is critical to the continued operation of our business. If Capella University becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV federal student financial aid programs, we could not conduct our business as it is currently conducted, and it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf any regulatory audit, investigation or other proceeding finds us not in compliance with the numerous laws and regulations applicable to the postsecondary education industry, we may not be able to successfully challenge such finding and our business could suffer.\nDue to the highly regulated nature of the postsecondary education industry, we are subject to audits, compliance reviews, inquiries, complaints, investigations, claims of non-compliance and lawsuits by federal and state governmental agencies, regulatory agencies, accrediting agencies, present and former students and employees, shareholders and other third parties, any of whom may allege violations of any of the regulatory requirements applicable to us. Such scrutiny may be heightened with regard to certain cutting-edge approach to services related to direct assessment, including our implementation of the borrower-based academic year for certain programs, designed to facilitate the learners\u2019 experience in direct assessment programs. In addition, the creation of interagency task forces, such as that between the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Departments of Justice, Treasury, and Veteran\u2019s Affairs, dedicated to examining proprietary schools, suggests that scrutiny of the sector continues to grow. If the results of any claims or actions are unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay monetary fines or penalties, be required to repay funds received under Title IV programs or state financial aid programs, have restrictions placed on or terminate our schools\u2019 or programs\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or state financial aid programs, have limitations placed on or terminate our schools\u2019 operations or ability to grant degrees and certificates, have our schools\u2019 accreditations restricted or revoked, or be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Any one of these sanctions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nIf we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation or if our institutional accrediting body loses recognition by the U.S. Department of Education, we could lose our ability to participate in Title IV programs and lose our authorization to operate in a number of states.\nCapella University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). The HLC is one of six regional accrediting agencies recognized by the Secretary of the Department of Education as a reliable indicator of educational quality. Accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency is required for an institution to become and remain eligible to participate in Title IV programs.\nIn January 2015, Capella University\u2019s accreditation with the HLC was reaffirmed. The reaffirmation enables Capella University to continue to participate in Title IV programs. The next reaffirmation of accreditation will take place in 2022-2023.\nTo remain accredited, we must continuously meet the HLC\u2019s Criteria for Accreditation and Core Components relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources and financial stability. Failure to meet any of these criteria or core components could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of the HLC.\nOn August 31, 2016, the HLC announced policy changes which give the Commission more discretion to designate institutions to be in \"financial distress\u201d or under \"government investigation.\u201d These policy changes are broad and involve discretion, and receipt of one of these designations could impact future accreditation status, eligibility for Title IV aid by triggering the Department of Education\u2019s financial responsibility triggers, or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nIn November 2017, the HLC announced policy changes to become effective September 1, 2019, mandating certain recruitment, admissions and related institutional practices. Among other requirements, the policy: mandates that recruitment personnel and vendors be qualified and properly trained, and that prospects be allowed sufficient time to review university policies, financial aid and transfer credit implications, as well as the terms of enrollment agreements, before program enrollment; prohibits certain time-sensitive promotions and restrictions against students\u2019 ability to initiate a lawsuit, state or accreditor complaint, or seek discharge of student loans; places conditions upon universities\u2019 use of automatic re-registration processes; and sets forth criteria for proper publication of job placement, salary and other learner outcomes data. In November 2017, the HLC also introduced guidelines for shared services relationships. These policy changes may create administrative burden or otherwise negatively impact our business. Compliance with these policy changes may increase our operating costs and in some cases require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. Further, new or amended accreditor policies, guidance or interpretations in the future could further negatively impact our business.\nIf the U.S. Department of Education ceased to recognize the HLC for any reason, Capella University would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs beginning 18 months after the date such recognition ceased unless the HLC was again recognized or our institution was accredited by another accrediting body recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. The Department of Education\u2019s National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality & Integrity reviewed the HLC in its June 2015 meeting and recommended renewal of the HLC's recognition for two and one half years.\nA failure to demonstrate \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d may result in the loss of eligibility by Capella University to participate in Title IV programs or require the posting of a letter of credit to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the Department of Education, or post a letter of credit in favor of the Department of Education and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. Any obligation to post a significant letter of credit could increase our costs of regulatory compliance. If Capella University is unable to secure a letter of credit, it would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. In addition to the obligation to post a letter of credit, an institution that is determined by the Department of Education not to be financially responsible can be transferred from the \u201cadvance\u201d system of payment of Title IV funds to cash monitoring status or to the \u201creimbursement\u201d system of payment. On November 1, 2016 the Department of Education substantially revised the existing financial responsibility requirements to expand their authority to collect Letters of Credit, which would amount to at least 10% of the previous year\u2019s Title IV allotment, in addition to situations which would require recalculation of the composite score more frequently than annually, although the Department of Education subsequently postponed implementation of the revised rule. In particular, certain audits and investigations by state, federal or other oversight entities, court or administrative judgments, the existence of certain lawsuits, the settlement of certain lawsuits, certain actions or probation by accrediting agencies, failure to derive 10 percent of revenues from non-Title IV sources in a given year, a cohort default rate of 30 percent or higher in the two most recent years, failure to comply with SEC regulations, SEC threatened proceedings or suspension, failure to satisfy gainful employment standards, fluctuation in the disbursement of Title IV funds, citation by a state licensing or authorizing agency, failure of a financial stress test, high annual dropout rates, violation of a loan agreement, or repayment of debt forgiven by the Department of Education in a borrower defense claim may render Capella University unable to meet its financial or administrative obligations or require letters of credit, for each triggering event, in an amount of at least 10% of the school\u2019s annual Title IV disbursements, and require that Capella University provide warnings to prospective and current learners that it has been required to provide enhanced financial protection to the Department of Education. Limitations on, or termination of, Capella University\u2019s participation in Title IV programs as a result of its failure to demonstrate financial responsibility would limit Capella University\u2019s learners\u2019 access to Title IV program funds, which could significantly reduce our enrollments and revenues and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA failure to demonstrate \u201cadministrative capability\u201d may result in the loss of Capella University's eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nDepartment of Education regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite \u201cadministrative capability\u201d to participate in Title IV programs. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or comply with any other Department of Education regulations, the Department of Education may:\n\u2022\nRequire the repayment of Title IV funds;\n\u2022\nTransfer the institution from the \u201cadvance\u201d system of payment of Title IV funds to cash monitoring status or to the \u201creimbursement\u201d system of payment;\n\u2022\nPlace the institution on provisional certification status; or\n\u2022\nCommence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV programs.\nIf we are found not to have satisfied the Department of Education\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements we could be limited in our access to, or lose, Title IV program funding, which would significantly reduce our enrollment and revenues and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe interplay of federal and state regulators, other governmental authorities, accreditors, and private litigants could cause one allegation to have a larger impact on our business.\nCertain regulations, such as the borrower defense to repayment rules, rely upon external actions of accreditors, government agencies and private litigants as triggers for adverse consequences for Title IV institutions. Similarly, policies of our accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission, allow it to designate institutions in \"financial distress\u201d or under \"government investigation\u201d at its discretion based on actions of regulators, litigation, other government bodies and other external circumstances. Viewed in combination, the regulations, policies, and authorities governing Capella University are increasingly an interrelated web. The interplay between federal and state governmental authorities, accreditors, and private litigation could result in one allegation, investigation, or action leading to a series of consequences, which cannot be predicted with certainty and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to comply with state authorization requirements in the operation of our job-ready skill entities, we could lose our ability to conduct business in those states.\nState regulation of software coding schools and other non-degree programs continues to evolve. In the event DevMountain, Hackbright or Capella Learning Solutions were to fail to comply with state or local laws and regulations governing their operations, they may face sanctions, penalties, or loss of the ability to operate. Additionally, increasingly strict requirements may impact the time required to obtain approval in a new location and may negatively impact operating margins.\nQui Tam and class action litigation in the sector could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn some circumstances of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with federal or state regulations, we may be subject to lawsuits including qui tam lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act or various, similar, state false claim statutes, and such lawsuits may impact our Title IV eligibility. In qui tam actions, private plaintiffs seek to enforce remedies under the Federal False Claims Act on behalf of the federal government and, if successful, are entitled to recover their costs and to receive a portion of any amounts recovered by the federal government in the lawsuit. These lawsuits can be prosecuted by a private plaintiff in respect of some action taken by us, even if the Department of Education does not agree with plaintiff's theory of liability. In addition, more prominent government and class action litigation in the sector, some related to doctoral students, could impact Capella University either by direct government investigation or private litigation against the Company or indirectly by consumer reaction to industry reputation by virtue of pending litigation against other institutions. In the event of such investigation or litigation, we could incur significant legal expenses defending ourselves against any such claims, and an adverse resolution of any future lawsuits could have an effect on our operating results and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere can be no assurance that the proposed merger with Strayer will be consummated. The pendency of the merger, or the failure of the merger to be consummated, could have an adverse effect on our stock price, business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nOn October 29, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Strayer Education, Inc. (\u201cStrayer\u201d) and Sarg Sub Inc. (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Strayer (the \u201cMerger\u201d). On November 22, 2017, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination, effective immediately, of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. On January 19, 2018, the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were approved by our shareholders. By letter dated February 26, 2018, the Department of Education issued the results of its preacquisition review of the proposed change in ownership of the Company. That letter confirms that, subject to submission of additional documents following the closing, Capella University will have uninterrupted participation in the Title IV Programs while the Department of Education completes its review of the relevant documentation. Consummation of the Merger is also subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals and other conditions specified in the Merger Agreement. However, regulatory approvals from certain educational agencies will also be required, including approval from the Higher Learning Commission. There can be no assurance that all of the regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger will be obtained and, if obtained, there can be no assurance (i) as to the timing of any approvals, (ii) the ability to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms, (iii) that the conditions will not have\nan adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, or results of operations or (iv) that the conditions will not result in the abandonment of the Merger. Litigation filed or that may be filed against us or our Board could also prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Merger will be consummated in a timely manner or at all.\nFurther, the pendency of the Merger could disrupt our businesses, in any of the following ways, among others:\n\u2022\nOur employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain and hire key managers and other employees;\n\u2022\nThe attention of our management may be directed toward the completion of the Merger and transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from our day-to-day business operations; and\n\u2022\nVendors, suppliers or others may seek to modify or terminate their business relationships with us.\nWe may face additional challenges in competing for new business and retaining or renewing business. These disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, if the Merger is not consummated, we will have incurred significant costs and diverted the time and attention of management. A failure to consummate the Merger may also result in negative publicity, litigation against us or our directors and officers, and a negative impression of us in the financial markets. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe may be unable to fully realize the expected benefits from the Merger.\nWe expect to achieve substantial operating and capital synergies and cost savings as a result of the Merger. If we are unable to successfully integrate the businesses, or integrate them in a timely fashion, we may face material adverse effects including, but not limited to (i) diversion of the attention of management and key personnel and potential disruption of our ongoing businesses, (ii) the loss of employees and learners, (iii) declines in our results of operations and financial condition and (iv) a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nEven if we successfully integrate the businesses, there can be no assurance that the Merger will result in the realization of the full benefit of the anticipated synergies and cost savings or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities and must generally operate our business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice (subject to certain exceptions). These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that arise prior to the completion of the Merger and are generally outside the ordinary course of business, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations or financial condition.\nA delay in completing the Merger may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits from the Merger.\nThe Merger is subject to a number of conditions, some of which are beyond our control, which could prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. We cannot predict whether and when the conditions will be satisfied. The requirement to obtain certain regulatory approvals could delay the completion of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. A delay in completing the Merger could cause the combined company to not realize some or all of the synergies and other benefits it expects to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame. Because the Merger Agreement contains certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, if the Merger is delayed, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to execute business strategies or pursue attractive business opportunities. In addition, a delay could cause management to focus on completion of the Merger instead of on other opportunities that could be beneficial to the company.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact us.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, our business may be adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of our management on the Merger. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and our Board seeks another merger or business combination, shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration offered under the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement provides for certain termination rights for both the Company and Strayer. In the event that the Company terminates the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances, the Company would be required to pay Strayer a termination fee in the amount of $25.0 million, and in the event that Strayer terminates the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances, Strayer would be required to pay the Company a termination fee in the amount of $25.0 million. The Company will also be required to pay Strayer the termination fee in the event it signs or consummates a Competing Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) within twelve months following the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances.\nIf we are not able to continuously innovate our academic offerings and our business model, including to address increased competition with competency-based learning models, we will not be able to keep pace and effectively compete in the highly competitive proprietary higher education market.\nOur success is built in part on our ability to innovate and adapt quickly to changing market dynamics. The pace of innovation in higher education continues to accelerate, especially with the more widespread adoption of competency-based learning models. The number of competency-based learning models, including direct assessment programs approved by the U.S. Department of Education to offer Title IV financial aid, is expected to increase in the upcoming years. As more competitors are approved to participate in such programs, competition in the market will continue to intensify. We need to continue to innovate ahead of market requirements and emerging competitive models, or our offerings may become less successful, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges we are making to our business to enhance our ability to improve learner success may adversely affect our growth rate, profitability, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn order to improve the learner experience, attract learners who are more likely to persist in our programs, and improve the persistence of new and current learners, we continue to implement a number of important changes and initiatives to transition our business to more effectively support our students and improve their educational outcomes. Certain of these enhancements may adversely impact the number of learners who enroll in our programs. Other initiatives may impact enrollments as we proactively work with learners who are not making sufficient and timely academic progress. In addition, we are investing significant resources in these learner success initiatives, which will have an impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly in the near term.\nWe may experience reduced revenues and operating margins if the number of our learners enrolled in doctoral programs continues to decrease, or if our learner success initiatives are not successful.\nTotal doctoral enrollment trends for Capella University continue to be negative. We are proactively seeking to increase doctoral enrollment through enhanced marketing, redesigning certain current programs to enhance affordability and differentiation, and by launching new programs, in particular professional doctorates. These efforts may not yield the intended results, and our revenues and operating margins may be reduced.\nWe also continue to focus on driving learner success in doctoral programs, particularly in the comprehensive and dissertation portions. These learner success efforts include engaging learners earlier and more often in preparation for the comprehensive and dissertation phase, leveraging analytics to personalize mentor support and effectiveness, more investments in faculty support in their role as mentors, and increasing visibility to milestone completion for learners and faculty. These investments may reduce our operating margins, may include changes that are not well received by faculty or learners, or may not yield the intended learner success improvements. In some instances, our learner success efforts may negatively impact total enrollment if learners who are not making sufficient and timely academic progress withdraw, are administratively withdrawn, or pursue a different degree program.\nOur financial performance depends in part on our ability to keep pace with current market needs, build our brand and maintain affordability.\nThe updates and expansions of our existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective learners or the employers of our graduates. If we cannot respond to changes in market requirements, our business may be adversely affected. We have shifted to a brand-driven marketing strategy to decrease our reliance on aggregators and improve the quality of the learners enrolling at Capella University. This shift has significantly lowered our inquiry volume, and if we are unable to maintain improvements in our conversion rates and retain enrolled learners, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, there is increasing focus and pressure on higher education providers to improve affordability. Affordability includes tuition costs, time to completion, and professional outcomes. If we are unable to keep pace with market and external\nexpectations regarding affordability, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nEfforts to diversify our business outside of the traditional areas served by Capella University may adversely impact our financial performance.\nAs we expand CLS offerings and seek additional opportunities to grow our business and serve markets beyond those traditionally served by Capella University, including job-ready skills training, employer-based solutions, and non-degree programs, we will encounter strategic and operational challenges different than those within our core business. As we expand our business lines, some of our expanded offerings may present us with business, strategic and operational challenges with which we have limited experience. We may partner with others to identify candidates for these programs, place candidates with employers, provide content, and share revenue, refunds, information and intellectual property related to such programs. As such, the success of these programs may be dependent on the performance of third party partners over which we have limited control, and may result in greater refunds and fewer learner candidates and placements with employers than anticipated. If we offer refunds to learners that are not successfully employed within a certain period of time following completion of these programs, our revenue from these programs will also be more dependent on the quality of our learners in these programs and employment conditions than our traditional programs. Additionally, investing in diversification and innovation may require significant resources and negatively impact our operating income and cash flows. If we are unable to successfully capitalize on these opportunities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.\nWe may pursue additional acquisition opportunities, which we may not do successfully and which may subject us to considerable business and financial risks.\nWe may continue to pursue additional acquisition opportunities. While we evaluate potential acquisitions on an ongoing basis, we may not be successful in assessing the value, strengths and weaknesses of acquisition opportunities or completing acquisitions on acceptable terms. For example, to the extent that our analysis and market studies performed by third parties are not accurate indicators of market, business and education trends, we may not appropriately evaluate or realize the future market growth or business opportunities in targeted programs, professions, geographic areas and business lines that we expect from an acquisition. Furthermore, we may not be successful in identifying acquisition opportunities, and suitable acquisition opportunities may not be made available or known to us. In addition, we may compete for certain acquisition targets with companies that have greater financial resources than we do. We may finance future acquisitions through cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facility, to the extent allowed by the terms of the credit facility, and/or other debt or equity financing. All of these financing mechanisms could reduce our cash available for other purposes.\nWe may incur significant expenses while pursuing acquisitions, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Acquisitions that we complete may expose us to particular business and financial risks that include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nDiverting management\u2019s time, attention and resources from managing our business;\n\u2022\nIncurring additional indebtedness and assuming liabilities;\n\u2022\nIncurring significant additional capital expenditures and operating expenses to improve, coordinate or integrate managerial, operational, financial and administrative systems;\n\u2022\nExperiencing an adverse impact on our earnings from non-recurring acquisition-related charges or the write-off or amortization of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u2022\nFailing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nFailing to implement or maintain our centralized accounting, learner support, and information systems effectively and efficiently because of additional demands from expanded business;\n\u2022\nFacing additional rules and regulations in new geographies and for new programs and endangering our compliance with applicable rules and regulations as the size and complexity of our business increases;\n\u2022\nFacing operational difficulties in new markets or with new program or service offerings; and\n\u2022\nFailing to retain key personnel and customers of the acquired businesses.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage acquired businesses or increase our cash flow from these operations. If we are unable to successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with acquisitions, or if we encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications or delays frequently encountered in connection with the integration of acquired entities and the expansion of operations, our growth and ability to compete may be impacted, we may fail to achieve\nacquisition synergies and we may be required to focus resources on integration of operations rather than other profitable areas. In addition, the increased costs associated with our acquisitions and capital expenditures aimed at organic growth may not be offset by corresponding increases in our revenues, which would decrease our operating margins.\nIf the overall trend in the operating performance of the Hackbright and DevMountain Coding Schools continues and operating improvements are not realized, some or all of the remaining goodwill and intangible assets associated with the Coding Schools reporting unit could become impaired in the future, resulting in the recognition of additional impairment charges.\nThroughout 2017, Hackbright and DevMountain continued to develop their offerings. In May 2017, DevMountain received approval to begin operating in Phoenix, and in the fourth quarter 2017, DevMountain introduced their first online program offering. Since the dates of acquisition, we have made investments in both businesses to position them for scalable growth and will continue to make additional investments for the foreseeable future. Although both acquisitions have had a positive impact on our revenue growth, Hackbright and DevMountain have not achieved the degree of revenue growth initially anticipated or met operating performance expectations, and these trends are expected to continue. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset charges of $15.0 million based on the results of the goodwill and intangible assets impairment analysis. Refer to Footnote 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets - within the Footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the year-ended December 31, 2017. If the overall trend in revenue growth and operating performance of the coding schools continues and operating improvements as discussed above are not realized, some or all of the remaining goodwill and intangible assets associated with the Coding Schools reporting unit could become impaired in the future, resulting in the recognition of additional impairment charges.\nWe face intense and increasing competition in the post-secondary education market, especially in the online education market, which could decrease our market share, increase our cost of attracting learners and put downward pressure on our tuition rates.\nPost-secondary education, especially in the online market, is a highly competitive industry. We compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges and other proprietary institutions, as well as corporate universities and software companies providing online education and training software. In addition, we face competition from various emerging nontraditional, credit-bearing and noncredit-bearing education programs. Each of these competitors may offer programs similar to ours at lower tuition levels as a result of government subsidies, government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial sources not available to all institutions. An increasing number of traditional colleges and community colleges are offering distance learning and other online education programs, including programs that are geared towards the needs of working adult learners. This trend has been accelerated by private companies that provide and/or manage online learning platforms for traditional colleges and community colleges. As the proportion of traditional colleges providing alternative learning modalities increases, we will face increasing competition for students from traditional colleges, including colleges with well-established reputations. As the online and distance learning segment of the postsecondary education market matures, we believe that the intensity of the competition we face will continue to be intense.\nThis intense competition could make it more challenging for us to enroll students who are likely to succeed in our educational programs, which could adversely affect our enrollment levels and put downward pressure on our tuition rates, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe external demands for increased affordability will continue to impact our business. For example, as the market continues to mature, certain of our competitors have begun to reduce tuition rates or offer significant discounts in the form of grants or scholarships. Capella University, like other universities particularly in the proprietary sector, has increased our use of grants and scholarships to improve learner persistence and as incentive to increase demand. Continuation of this trend will further decrease the amount of tuition we receive from learners unless we can increase persistence and/or increase our spending to pursue new market opportunities. In addition, certain of our competitors have increased their focus on markets and learners that we have historically served, and these actions could increase costs and decrease our enrollments and revenue. As Capella University seeks to strengthen its employer alignment, we face increased competition in maintaining and developing new marketing relationships with corporations and other employers, particularly as employers become more selective as to which online universities they will encourage their current employees to attend and from which online universities they will hire prospective employees. These competitive factors could adversely affect our enrollments, revenue, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in learner enrollment and financial aid, our business could be adversely impacted.\nAs we continue to grow, we are susceptible to continued risk of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to learner enrollment and student financial aid programs. While we believe past incidents of fraudulent activity have been relatively isolated, we cannot be certain that our systems and processes will always be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated and ever-changing fraud schemes. The potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened due to our nature as an online education provider. We must maintain systems and processes to identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid. Efforts we take to identify and prevent fraudulent applications may also impose additional processes on potential legitimate learners, which could adversely affect our enrollments, revenue, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Department of Education requires institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Education any credible information indicating that any applicant, employee, third-party servicer, or agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves administration of the Title IV programs has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs. If the systems and processes that we have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate, the Department of Education may find that we do not satisfy its \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements. This could limit our access to, or cause us to lose, Title IV program funding, which would adversely affect our enrollment, revenues, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our ability to participate in Title IV programs is conditioned on our maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the Secretary of Education. Any significant failure to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to learner enrollment and financial aid could cause us to fail to meet our accrediting agencies\u2019 standards. Furthermore, under the Higher Education Act, accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions that offer distance learning programs, as we do, must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a learner who registers for a distance education program is the same learner who participates in and receives credit for the program. Failure to meet our accrediting agencies\u2019 standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of our accrediting agencies, which could result in a loss of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on third party vendors, and the outsourcing increases our operational and compliance risk.\nWe rely on third party vendors to provide services to us and our learners. While we monitor and assess the service of these vendors, it is possible their service and response levels may be less than ours, and that they may not have adequate business continuity planning. Some of our vendors are uniquely positioned to provide novel services not offered by others in the industry, such as vendors providing services related to implementation of the borrower-based academic year for direct\nassessment programs, increasing our dependency related to complex operational functions. In addition, using third party vendors increases compliance risk, if they do not adequately protect learners\u2019 sensitive data or personally identifiable information, or if they do not comply with applicable federal or state regulations applicable to our business. In the event of any of those or related actions or omissions by third party vendors, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nSystem disruptions and vulnerability from security risks to our online infrastructure or the infrastructure of key third-party providers could impact our business and financial performance and damage the reputation of the Company, limiting our ability to attract and retain learners.\nThe performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain learners. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of our courseroom platform, damaging our business and financial performance and the reputation of the Company. Our technology infrastructure could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist activities, telecommunications failures and/or the unavailability or disruption of third-party providers used as a part of our technology platform. Our core computer network infrastructure is concentrated in a single geographic area. If we experience a catastrophic failure or unavailability for any reason of both our principal data center and backup data center, we may need to replicate the function of these data centers elsewhere, which may require expensive and time-consuming equipping and restoring activities. The disruption from such an event could significantly impact our operations and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience interruptions or failures in our computer systems as a result of ongoing maintenance of and enhancements to our enterprise resource planning system, course room platform, and/or supporting infrastructure. Any interruption to our technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain learners and could require us to incur additional expenses to correct or mitigate the interruption.\nOur technology infrastructure may also be vulnerable to cyber attacks such as unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malware and other security problems and system disruptions. We engage with multiple cyber security\nassessment providers on a periodic basis to review, assess and remediate our cyber security program. We utilize this information to audit ourselves to ensure that we are continually monitoring the security of our technology infrastructure and have a rehearsed response to cyber security incidents, but we are still vulnerable to threats. Circumvention of cyber security measures could lead to misappropriation of personally identifiable or proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches, respond to loss or exposure of data or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft or loss that could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. We use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our learners and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, circumvention of these controls could occur, and could result in a breach of learner or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of learner or employee privacy.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information. We cannot guarantee that a breach, loss or theft of personal information will not occur. A breach, theft, or loss of personal information regarding our learners and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under state and federal privacy statutes and legal actions by state attorneys, general and private litigants, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property that may not be adequately protected under current laws, and we encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property of third parties.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and practices, and other agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on service mark and trademark protection in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to the marks \u201cCAPELLA,\u201d \u201cCAPELLA EDUCATION COMPANY,\u201d and \u201cCAPELLA UNIVERSITY,\u201d as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services. We rely on agreements under which we obtain rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third-party content experts. We cannot guarantee that these measures will be adequate, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the United States or select foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our curricula, online resource material and other content. Our management's attention may be diverted by these attempts and we may need to use funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. Third parties have in the past and may again in the future raise claims against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third party. Some third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid those intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit. Our general liability and cyber liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content of our classes or pay monetary damages or license fees to third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur learner population and revenues could decrease if the government tuition assistance offered to U.S. Armed Forces personnel is reduced or eliminated, if the tuition discounts which we offer to U.S. Armed Forces personnel are reduced or eliminated, or if our informal arrangements with any military bases deteriorate.\nActive duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from the government, which they may use to pursue postsecondary degrees. Our ability to accept such tuition assistance depends, in part, upon our continued compliance with federal regulations and any applicable memoranda of understanding with the Department of Defense and\nrelated agencies. We offer tuition discounts generally ranging from 10% to 15% to all members of the U.S. Armed Forces and spouses of active duty U.S. Armed Forces personnel as well as recipients of the Veterans Affairs (VA) Dependents Education Assistance program (Chapter 35). As of December 31, 2017, learners receiving a military discount comprised approximately 9% of Capella University total enrollment. We also have non-exclusive agreements with various educational institutions of the U.S. Armed Forces pursuant to which we have agreed to accept credits toward a Capella University degree from certain military educational programs.\nThese agreements generally may be terminated by either party upon 30 to 45 days notice. Additionally, we have informal arrangements with several military bases pursuant to which the bases make information about Capella University available to interested service members. Each of these informal arrangements is not binding on either party and either party could end the arrangement at any time. If our informal arrangement with any military base deteriorates or ends, our efforts to recruit learners from that base will be impaired. In the event that governmental tuition assistance programs to active duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces are reduced or eliminated, if our tuition discount program which we offer U.S. Armed Forces personnel and their immediate family members is reduced or eliminated, or if our informal arrangements with any military base deteriorates, this could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to offer products aligned with employer expectations or do not maintain existing, and develop additional, relationships with employers, our future growth may be impaired.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to offer products aligned with learners\u2019 professional goals and employer expectations. If our products are not aligned with these external needs, then our offerings will be less successful and this would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we currently have relationships with large employers to provide their employees with the opportunity to obtain degrees through us while continuing their employment. These relationships are an important part of our strategy as they provide us with a steady source of potential working adult learners for particular programs and also serve to increase our reputation among high-profile employers. If we are unable to develop new relationships, or if our existing relationships deteriorate or end, our efforts to seek these sources of potential working adult learners will be impaired, and this could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our programs have specialized accreditations and/or state approvals; our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain such accreditations or approvals in the future, or if such accreditations or approvals impose requirements that impact other aspects of our business.\nCertain of our programs, especially at the master's and doctoral level, have specialized accreditations or program approvals which are desirable to our learners and may be important to learners obtaining licensure or certification in their chosen field of study. In addition, certain of our education-related programs are approved by the Minnesota Board of Teaching or other state higher educational oversight authorities. If we are unable to obtain or renew such accreditations or approvals in the future, our programs will be less attractive to prospective learners and our current learners in such programs will be negatively impacted. In addition, these specialized accrediting bodies or state agencies may impose requirements which adversely impact our business, such as limiting or closing enrollments to certain programs, imposing specific faculty to learner ratios or dictating the way in which we name and market related programs. These situations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to continue to develop awareness among, and attract and retain, high quality learners.\nBuilding awareness of Capella University and the programs we offer among working adult professionals, our primary target market, is critical to our ability to attract prospective learners. If we are unable to successfully market and advertise our educational programs, Capella University's ability to attract and enroll prospective learners in such programs could be adversely affected, and consequently, our ability to increase revenue or maintain profitability could be impaired. It is also critical to our success that we convert these prospective learners to enrolled learners in a cost-effective manner and that these enrolled learners remain active in our programs. Some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully enrolling and retaining learners in our programs include:\n\u2022\nThe emergence of more successful competitors;\n\u2022\nFactors related to our marketing, including the costs of Internet advertising and broad-based branding campaigns;\n\u2022\nPerformance problems with our online systems;\n\u2022\nFailure to maintain accreditation;\n\u2022\nLearner dissatisfaction with our services, programs and outcomes, including with our customer service and responsiveness;\n\u2022\nAdverse publicity regarding us, our competitors, or online or proprietary education in general;\n\u2022\nPrice reductions by competitors that we are unwilling or unable to match;\n\u2022\nIncreased regulation of online education, including in states in which we do not have a physical presence;\n\u2022\nA decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that learners derive from our programs;\n\u2022\nLitigation or regulatory investigations that may damage our reputation;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in executing on our strategy as a preferred provider to employers for the vertical markets we serve; and\n\u2022\nChallenges building and leveraging our presence in social media and mobile-device services.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop awareness of Capella University and the programs we offer, and to enroll and retain learners, our enrollments would suffer and our ability to increase revenues and maintain profitability would be significantly impaired.\nWe may experience lower revenues per learner, reduced margins and higher default rates if our degree mix changes unfavorably.\nThe ratio of learners in our bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s and doctoral programs shifts over time due to program offerings, competition in the market, learner demand, employment rates, economic conditions and other factors. For example, our bachelor\u2019s programs have historically generated lower retention rates, higher default rates, and higher bad debt expense compared to our graduate level programs. Also, master's and bachelor's programs have historically generated lower revenues per learner compared to our doctoral programs. As the mix of our learners continues to be subject to variability in the future, we may experience these and other effects, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions.\nIn certain circumstances, our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions, including paying dividends, repurchasing shares, offering loans to learners, and acquiring and disposing of assets or businesses. Accordingly, we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our shareholders. Our credit agreement also requires us to satisfy specified financial and non-financial covenants, including covenants relating to regulatory compliance. A breach of any covenants contained in our credit agreement would result in an event of default under the agreement and allow the lenders to pursue various remedies, including accelerating the repayment of any indebtedness outstanding under the agreement, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 91605, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "CPLA"}
