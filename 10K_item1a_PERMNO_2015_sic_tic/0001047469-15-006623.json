RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The market or trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks. In addition, please see our note about forward-looking statements included in Part II, Item 7, MD&A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nVolatility in gold, silver, copper, nickel and other metal prices may have an adverse impact on the value of our royalty and stream interests and may reduce our revenues. Certain contracts governing our royalty and stream interests have features that may amplify the negative effects of a drop in metals prices.\nThe profitability of our royalty and stream interests is directly related to the market price of gold, silver, copper, nickel and other metals. Our revenue is particularly sensitive to changes in the price of gold, as we derive a majority of our revenue from gold royalty and stream interests. Market prices may fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the control of Royal Gold or any mining company, including metal supply, industrial and jewelry fabrication, investment demand, central banking\neconomic policy, expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, the relative strength of the dollar and other currencies, interest rates, gold purchases, sales and loans by central banks, forward sales by metal producers, global or regional political, economic or banking conditions, and a number of other factors.\nVolatility in gold, silver, copper and nickel prices is demonstrated by the annual high and low prices for those metals over the past decade:\nDeclines in market prices for gold, silver, copper, nickel and certain other metals such as those experienced during our fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and through the date of this filing, decreased our revenues. Severe declines in market prices could cause an operator to reduce, suspend or terminate production from an operating project or construction work at a development project, which may result in a temporary or permanent reduction or cessation of revenue from those projects, and we might not be able to recover the initial investment in our royalty and stream interests. Our sliding-scale royalties, such as Cortez, Holt, Mulatos, Wolverine and other properties, amplify this effect, because when metal prices fall below certain thresholds in a sliding-scale royalty, a lower royalty rate will apply. Also, certain streaming agreements, including our Mount Milligan stream, provide us the right to purchase metals at fixed prices. In the event that prevailing market prices decline, the margin between the price at which we can purchase such metals pursuant to the terms of the streaming agreements and the price at which we sell such metals in the market will decline, and we will generate lower cash flow or earnings. Any price decline may result in a material and adverse effect on our profitability, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the selection of a property for development, the determination to construct a mine and place it into production, and the dedication of funds necessary to achieve such purposes are decisions that must be made long before the first revenues from production will be received. Price fluctuations between the time that decisions about development and construction are made and the commencement of production can have a material adverse effect on the economics of a mine and can eliminate or have a material adverse impact on the value of royalty and stream interests.\nWhere gold and silver are produced as by-product metals at the properties where we hold royalty and stream interests, such as at Mount Milligan and Andacollo, an operator's production decisions and the economic cut-off applied to its reporting of gold and silver reserves and resources may be influenced by changes in the commodity prices of the other metals produced at the mines.\nMoreover, certain agreements governing our royalty interests, such as those relating to our royalty interests in the Robinson, Pe\u00f1asquito and Voisey's Bay properties, are based on the operator's concentrate sales to smelters, which include price adjustments between the operator and the smelter based on metals prices at a later date, typically three to five months after shipment to the smelter. In such cases, our payments from the operator include a component of these later price adjustments, which can result in decreased revenue in later periods if metals prices have fallen.\nWe own passive interests in mining properties, and it is difficult or impossible for us to ensure properties are developed or operated in our best interest.\nAll of our current revenue is derived from royalty and stream interests on properties operated by third parties. The holder of a royalty or stream interest typically has no authority regarding the development or operation of a mineral property. Therefore, we typically are not in control of decisions regarding development or operation of any of the properties on which we hold a royalty or stream interest, and we have limited legal rights to influence those decisions.\nOur strategy of acquiring and holding royalty and stream interests on properties operated by third parties puts us generally at risk to the decisions of others regarding all operating matters, including permitting, feasibility analysis, mine design and operation, processing, plant and equipment matters and temporary or permanent suspension of operations, among others. As a result, our revenue is dependent upon the activities of third parties, which creates the risk that at any time those third parties may: (i) have business interests that are inconsistent with ours, (ii) take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, or (iii) be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under their agreements with us. At any time, any of the operators of our mining properties may decide to suspend or discontinue operations. Except in limited circumstances, we will not be entitled to material compensation if operations are shut down, suspended or discontinued on a temporary or permanent basis. Although we attempt to secure contractual rights when we create new royalty or stream interests, such as audit or access rights, that will permit us to protect our interests to a degree, there can be no assurance that such rights will always be available or sufficient, or that our efforts will be successful in achieving timely or favorable results or in affecting the operation of the properties in which we have a royalty or stream interest in ways that would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur revenues are subject to operational and other risks faced by operators of our mining properties.\nAlthough we are not required to pay capital costs (except for transactions where we finance mine development or actively fund or participate ourselves in exploration or development projects or in certain other limited circumstances) or operating costs, our financial results are indirectly subject to hazards and risks normally associated with developing and operating mining properties where we hold royalty and stream interests. Some of these risks include:\n\u2022 insufficient ore reserves;\n\u2022 increases in production or capital costs incurred by operators or third parties that may impact the amount of reserves available to be mined, cause an operator to delay or curtail mining development and operations, or render mining of ore uneconomical and cause an operator to close operations;\n\u2022 declines in the price of gold, silver, copper, nickel and other metals;\n\u2022 mine operating and ore processing facility problems;\n\u2022 economic downturns and operators' insufficient financing;\n\u2022 insolvency or bankruptcy of the operator;\n\u2022 significant permitting, environmental and other regulatory requirements and restrictions and any changes in those regulations;\n\u2022 challenges by non-mining interests to existing permits and mining rights, and to applications for permits and mining rights;\n\u2022 opposition by local communities, indigenous populations and non-governmental organizations;\n\u2022 community or civil unrest;\n\u2022 labor shortages, increased labor costs, and labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages at mines;\n\u2022 unavailability of mining, drilling and related equipment;\n\u2022 unanticipated geological conditions or metallurgical characteristics;\n\u2022 unanticipated ground or water conditions;\n\u2022 pit wall or tailings dam failures or any underground stability issues;\n\u2022 fires, explosions and other industrial accidents;\n\u2022 environmental hazards and natural catastrophes such as floods, earthquakes or inclement or hazardous weather conditions;\n\u2022 injury to persons, property or the environment;\n\u2022 the ability of operators to maintain or increase production or to replace reserves as properties are mined; and\n\u2022 uncertain domestic and foreign political and economic environments.\nThe occurrence of any of the above mentioned risks or hazards could result in an interruption, suspension or termination of operations or development work at any of the properties in which we hold a royalty or stream interest and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAcquired royalty and stream interests, particularly on development stage properties, are subject to the risk that they may not produce anticipated revenues.\nThe royalty and stream interests we acquire may not produce anticipated revenues. The success of our acquisitions of royalty and stream interests is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, timing and amount of revenues to be derived from our royalty and stream interests and, for development projects, the costs, timing and conduct of development. If an operator does not bring a property into production and operate in accordance with feasibility studies, technical or reserve reports or other plans due to lack of capital, inexperience, unexpected problems, delays, or otherwise, then the acquired royalty or stream interest may not yield sufficient revenues to be profitable for us. Furthermore, operators of development stage properties must obtain and maintain all necessary environmental permits and access to water, power and other raw materials needed to begin production, and there can be no assurance that operators will be able to do so.\nThe Pascua-Lama mining project in Chile and Argentina is among our principal development stage acquisitions. During the fourth calendar quarter of 2013, Barrick announced the suspension of construction at the Pascua-Lama project, except for those activities required for environmental and regulatory compliance. Barrick has indicated that a decision to restart development will depend on improved economics and reduced uncertainty related to legal and regulatory requirements. The failure of the Pascua-Lama project, or any of our other principal properties, to produce anticipated revenues on schedule or at all would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or the other benefits we expect to realize from the acquisition of royalty interests.\nFurther, as mines on which we have royalty and stream interests mature, we can expect overall declines in production over the years unless operators are able to replace reserves that are mined through mine expansion or successful new exploration. There can be no assurance that the operators of properties where we hold royalty and stream interests will be able to maintain or increase production or replace reserves as they are mined.\nSeveral of our royalty and stream interests are significant to us and any adverse development related to these properties could adversely affect our revenues.\nOur investments in the Mount Milligan, Andacollo, Voisey's Bay and Pe\u00f1asquito properties, among others, were significant to us in fiscal year 2015, as our interests in these properties generated approximately $179.1 million in revenue in fiscal year 2015, which was nearly 65% of our revenue for the period. We expect these properties, our new gold and silver stream at Pueblo Viejo, and others to be significant in fiscal year 2016. Any adverse development affecting the operation of or production from any of these properties would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Any adverse decision made by the operators, such as changes to mine plans, production schedules, metallurgical processes or royalty calculation methodologies, may materially and adversely impact the timing and amount of revenue that we receive.\nUnknown defects or impairments in our royalty or streaming interests and title defects could adversely affect our business and revenues.\nUnknown defects in or disputes relating to the royalty and stream interests we hold or acquire may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits from our royalty and stream interests, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. It is also possible that material changes could occur that may adversely affect management's estimate of the carrying value of our royalty and stream interests and could result in impairment charges. While we seek to confirm the existence, validity, enforceability, terms and geographic extent of the royalty and stream interests we acquire, there can be no assurance that disputes over these and other matters will not arise. Confirming these matters, as well as the title to mining property on which we hold or seek to acquire a royalty or stream interest, is a complex matter, and is subject to the application of the laws of each jurisdiction to the particular circumstances of each parcel of mining property and to the documents reflecting the royalty or stream interest. Similarly, royalty and stream interests in many jurisdictions are contractual in nature, rather than interests in land, and therefore may be subject to change of control, bankruptcy or the insolvency of operators. We often do not have the protection of security interests over property that we could liquidate to recover all or part of our investment in a royalty or stream interest. Even if we retain our royalty and stream interests in a mining project after any change of control, bankruptcy or insolvency of the operator, the project may end up under the control of a new operator, who may or may not operate the project in a similar manner to the current operator, which may negatively impact us.\nOperators may interpret our royalty and stream interests in a manner adverse to us or otherwise may not abide by their contractual obligations, and we could be forced to take legal action to enforce our contractual rights.\nOur royalty and stream interests generally are subject to uncertainties and complexities arising from the application of contract and property laws in the jurisdictions where the mining projects are located. Operators and other parties to the agreements governing our royalty and stream interests may interpret our interests in a manner adverse to us or otherwise may not abide by their contractual obligations, and we could be forced to take legal action to enforce our contractual rights. We may or may not be successful in enforcing our contractual rights, and our revenues relating to any challenged royalty or stream interests may be delayed, curtailed or eliminated during the pendency of any such dispute or in the event our position is not upheld, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Disputes could arise challenging, among other things:\n\u2022 the existence or geographic extent of the royalty or stream interest;\n\u2022 methods for calculating the royalty or stream interest, including whether certain operator costs may properly be deducted from gross proceeds when calculating royalties determined on a net basis;\n\u2022 third party claims to the same royalty interest or to the property on which we have a royalty or stream interest;\n\u2022 various rights of the operator or third parties in or to the royalty or stream interest;\n\u2022 production and other thresholds and caps applicable to payments of royalty or stream interests;\n\u2022 the obligation of an operator to make payments on royalty and stream interests; and\n\u2022 various defects or ambiguities in the agreement governing a royalty and stream interest.\nFor example, in December 2014, the Labrador Nickel Royalty Limited Partnership (\"LNRLP\"), of which the Company is the indirect majority owner, amended its October 2009 statement of claim against Vale and certain subsidiaries of Vale. LNRLP alleges that Vale has been calculating LNRLP's 3% NSR royalty on nickel, copper and cobalt produced from the Voisey's Bay mine incorrectly since production began in late 2005 and that Vale has breached its contractual duties of good faith and honest performance. LNRLP received the first quarterly royalty payment relating to processing Voisey's Bay nickel concentrates at Vale's new Long Harbour Processing Plant. In response to questions concerning Vale's determination of the Long Harbour smelter and refining charges deducted from actual proceeds to calculate the NSR royalty payable, Vale recently stated that the charges included \"the cost of product sold, pre-operating costs, depreciation and cost of capital,\" a calculation methodology that the Company estimates could result in a substantial reduction or elimination of royalty payable to LNRLP on Voisey's Bay nickel concentrates processed at Long Harbour. The Company strongly disagrees with Vale's determination that these changes are permissible deductions pursuant to the royalty agreement and is requesting further clarification of the basis for these charges while aggressively pursuing its legal remedies.\nPotential litigation affecting the properties that we have royalty and stream interests in could have an adverse effect on us.\nPotential litigation may arise between the operators of properties on which we have royalty and stream interests and third parties. For example, Barrick's Pascua-Lama mining project has been the subject of litigation by local farmers and indigenous communities alleging that the project's water management system is not in compliance with environmental permits and that the project has damaged glaciers located in the Pascua-Lama project area. As a holder of royalty and stream interests, we generally will not have any influence on litigation such as this and generally will not have access to non-public information concerning such litigation. Any such litigation that results in the reduction, cessation or termination of a project or production from a property, whether temporary or permanent, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may enter into acquisitions or other material transactions at any time.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we engage in a continual review of opportunities to acquire existing royalty and stream interests, to create new royalty and stream interests through the financing of exploration, development or producing mining projects, and to acquire companies that hold royalty or stream interests. We currently, and generally at any time, have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, technical, financial and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest and participation in discussions or negotiations for acquisitions. We also consider obtaining debt commitments for acquisition financing. In the event that we choose to raise debt capital\nto finance any acquisition, our leverage will be increased. We also could issue common stock or incur additional indebtedness to fund our acquisitions. Issuances of common stock would dilute existing stockholders and may reduce some or all of our per share financial measures.\nAny such acquisition could be material to us. In pursuit of such opportunities, we may fail to select appropriate acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable arrangements, including arrangements to finance acquisitions. In addition, any such acquisition or other transaction may have other transaction specific risks associated with it, including risks related to the completion of the transaction, the project, its operators, or the jurisdictions in which the project is located and other risks discussed in this Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that any acquisitions completed will ultimately benefit the Company.\nIn addition, we may consider opportunities to restructure our royalty or stream interests where we believe such restructuring would provide a long-term benefit to the Company, though such restructuring may reduce near-term revenues or result in the incurrence of transaction related costs. We could enter into one or more acquisition or restructuring transactions at any time.\nWe may be unable to successfully acquire additional royalty or stream interests at appropriate valuations.\nOur future success largely depends upon our ability to acquire royalty and stream interests at appropriate valuations, including through royalty, stream and corporate acquisitions and other financing transactions. Most of our revenues are derived from royalty and streams interests that we acquire or finance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and complete the acquisition of such royalty and stream interests or businesses that own desired interests, at reasonable prices or on favorable terms, or, if necessary, that we will have or be able to obtain sufficient financing on reasonable terms to complete such acquisitions. Continued economic volatility or a credit crisis, or severe declines in market prices for gold, silver, copper, nickel and certain other metals, could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt or equity financing for acquisitions. In addition, changes to tax rules, accounting policies, or the treatment of stream interests by ratings agencies could make royalties, streams or other investments by the Company less attractive to counterparties. Such changes could adversely affect our ability to acquire new royalty or stream interests.\nWe face substantial competition, and we may not be able to compete successfully in acquiring new royalty and stream interests.\nWe face substantial competition in the acquisition of royalty and stream interests. We have competitors that are engaged in the acquisition of royalty and stream interests and companies holding such interests, including competitors with greater financial resources, and we may not be able to compete successfully against these companies in new acquisitions. If we are unable to successfully acquire additional royalty or stream interests, the reserves subject to our royalty and stream interests may decline as the producing properties on which we have such royalty and stream interests are mined or payment or production caps on certain of our royalty interests are met. We also may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or operators of properties on which we seek royalty and stream interests if we are unable to successfully complete acquisitions of such interests or complete them at satisfactory rates of return. Each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe depend on our operators for the calculation of payments of our royalty and stream interests. We may not be able to detect errors and later payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments.\nThe payments of our royalty and stream interests are calculated by the operators of the properties on which we have royalty and stream interests based on their reported production. Each operator's calculation of our payments is subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of its\nproduction and accounting functions, and, given the complex nature of mining and ownership of mining interests, errors may occur from time to time in the allocation of production and the various other calculations made by an operator. Any of these errors may render calculations of such payments inaccurate. Certain agreements governing our royalty and stream interests require the operators to provide us with production and operating information that may, depending on the completeness and accuracy of such information, enable us to detect errors in the calculation of payments of royalty and deliveries under metal streams. We do not, however, have the contractual right to receive production information for all of our royalty interests. As a result, our ability to detect payment errors through our royalty and stream monitoring program and its associated internal controls and procedures is limited, and the possibility exists that we will need to make retroactive revenue adjustments. Some contracts governing our royalty and stream interests provide us the right to audit the operational calculations and production data for the associated royalty payments and metal stream deliveries; however, such audits may occur many months following our recognition of the revenue and we may be required to adjust our revenue in later periods, which could require us to restate our financial statements.\nDevelopment and operation of mines is very capital intensive and any inability of the operators of properties where we hold royalty and stream interests to meet liquidity needs, obtain financing or operate profitably could have material adverse effects on the value of and revenue from our royalty and stream interests.\nThe development and operation of mines is very capital intensive, and if operators of properties where we hold royalty and stream interests do not have the financial strength or sufficient credit or other financing capability to cover the costs of developing or operating a mine, the operator may curtail, delay or cease development or operations at a mine site. Operators' ability to raise and service sufficient capital may be affected by, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, future commodity prices of metals to be mined, or further economic volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets as has been experienced in recent years. If certain of the operators of the properties on which we have royalty and stream interests suffer these material adverse effects, then our interests, including the value of and revenue from them, and the ability of operators to obtain debt or equity financing for the exploration, development and operation of their properties may be materially adversely affected.\nCertain of our royalty and stream interests are subject to payment or production caps or rights in favor of the operator or third parties that could reduce the revenues generated from the interests.\nSome of our royalty and stream interests are subject to limitations, such that the royalty or stream interest will extinguish or decrease after threshold production is achieved or payments at stated thresholds are made. For example:\n\u2022 our gold stream at Pueblo Viejo decreases from 7.50% of Barrick's interest in gold produced at Pueblo Viejo to 3.75% after 990,000 ounces of gold have been delivered. Similarly, our silver stream decreases from 75% of Barrick's interest in silver produced at Pueblo Viejo to 37.50% after 50.00 million ounces of silver have been produced;\n\u2022 our stream at Andacollo decreases from 100% of payable gold to 50% of payable gold once 900,000 ounces have been delivered;\n\u2022 our royalty at Mulatos is subject to a 2.0 million ounce cap on gold production, of which there has been approximately 1.41 million ounces of cumulative production as of June 30, 2015; and\n\u2022 approximately 20% of our royalty at Pascua-Lama is limited to the first 14.0 million ounces of gold produced from the project, and another 24% of the royalty can be extended beyond 14.0 million ounces produced for a payment of $4.4 million.\nAlso, certain individuals from whom we purchased portions of our royalties at Pascua-Lama are entitled to one-time payments if the price of gold exceeds certain thresholds. If any of these thresholds are met or similar rights are exercised or we fail to make the required payment, our future revenue could be reduced.\nEstimates of reserves and mineralization by the operators of mines in which we have royalty and stream interests are subject to significant revision.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proven and probable reserves and mineralization, including many factors beyond our control and the control of the operators of properties in which we have royalty and stream interests. Reserve estimates for our royalty and stream interests are prepared by the operators of the mining properties. We do not participate in the preparation or verification of such reports and have not independently assessed or verified the accuracy of such information.\nThe estimation of reserves and of other mineralized material is a subjective process, and the accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, metallurgical testing and production, and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate, may cause a revision of such estimates. The volume and grade of reserves recovered and rates of production may be less than anticipated. Assumptions about gold and other precious metal prices are subject to great uncertainty, and such prices have fluctuated widely in the past. Declines in the market price of gold, silver, copper, nickel or other metals also may render reserves or mineralized material containing relatively lower ore grades uneconomical to exploit. Changes in operating costs and other factors including short-term operating factors, the processing of new or different ore grades, geotechnical characteristics and metallurgical recovery, may materially and adversely affect reserves. Finally, it is important to note that our royalty and stream agreements generally give us interests in only a small portion of the production from the operators' aggregate reserves, and the size of those interests varies widely based on the individual documents governing them.\nMineral resources as reported by some operators do not constitute mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Due to the uncertainty of mineral resources, there can be no assurance that such resources will be upgraded to proven and probable mineral reserves as a result of continued exploration. It should not be assumed that any part or all of mineral resources on properties where we hold royalty and stream interests constitute or will be converted into mineral reserves.\nEstimates of production by the operators of mines in which we have royalty and stream interests are subject to change, and actual production may vary materially from such estimates.\nProduction estimates are prepared by the operators of mining properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating anticipated production attributable to our royalty and stream interests, including many factors beyond our control and the control of the operators of the properties in which we have royalty and stream interests. We do not participate in the preparation or verification of production estimates and have not independently assessed or verified the accuracy of such information. The estimation of anticipated production is a subjective process and the accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quality of available data, reliability of production history, variability in grade encountered, mechanical or other problems encountered, engineering and geological interpretation and operator judgment. Rates of production may be less than expected. Results of drilling, metallurgical testing and production, changes in commodity prices, and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate may cause actual production to vary materially from such estimates.\nIf title to properties is not properly maintained by the operators, or is successfully challenged by third parties, our royalty and stream interests could be found to be invalid.\nOur business includes the risk that operators of mining projects and holders of mining claims, tenements, concessions, mining licenses or other interests in land and mining rights may lose their exploration or mining rights, or have their rights to mining properties contested by private parties or\nthe government. Internationally, mining tenures are subject to loss for many reasons, including expiration, failure of the holder to meet specific legal qualifications, failure to pay maintenance fees or meet expenditure requirements, reduction in geographic extent upon passage of time or upon conversion from an exploration tenure to a mining tenure, failure of title and similar risks. Unpatented mining claims, for example, which constitute a significant portion of the properties on which we hold royalty interests in the United States, and which are generally considered subject to greater title risk than real property interests held by absolute title, are often uncertain and subject to contest by third parties and the government. If title to unpatented mining claims or other mining tenures subject to our royalty and stream interests has not been properly established or is not properly maintained, or is successfully contested, our royalty and stream interests could be adversely affected.\nOperations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to many risks, which could decrease our revenues.\nWe derived approximately 85% of our revenues from foreign sources during fiscal year 2015, compared to approximately 85% in fiscal year 2014 and 83% in fiscal year 2013. Our principal producing royalty and stream interests on properties outside of the United States are located in Canada, Chile and Mexico. We currently have royalty and stream interests in mines and projects in other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Dominican Republic, Finland, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, Macedonia, Nicaragua, Peru, Russia, Spain and Tunisia. In addition, future acquisitions may expose us to new jurisdictions. Our foreign activities are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries. These risks include, depending on the country, such things as:\n\u2022 expropriation or nationalization of property, which has occurred in the past in Argentina and other countries in which we have or may acquire royalty and stream interests;\n\u2022 seizure of mineral production;\n\u2022 exchange and currency controls and fluctuations;\n\u2022 limitations on foreign exchange and repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022 increased foreign taxation or imposition of new or increased mining royalty interests;\n\u2022 restrictions on mineral production and price controls;\n\u2022 import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold, silver, copper, nickel or other metals;\n\u2022 changes in legislation, including changes related to taxation, royalty interests, imports, exports, duties, currency, foreign ownership, foreign trade and foreign investment;\n\u2022 high rates of inflation;\n\u2022 labor practices and disputes;\n\u2022 enforcement of unfamiliar or uncertain foreign real estate, mineral tenure, contract, water use, mine safety and environmental laws and policies;\n\u2022 challenges to mining, processing and related permits and licenses, or to applications for permits and licenses, by or on behalf of regulatory authorities, indigenous populations, non-governmental organizations or other third parties;\n\u2022 renegotiation, nullification or forced modification of existing contracts, licenses, permits, approvals, concessions or the like;\n\u2022 war, crime, terrorism, sabotage, civil unrest and uncertain political and economic environments;\n\u2022 corruption;\n\u2022 exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions to which we, but not necessarily our competitors, may be subject;\n\u2022 suspension of the enforcement of creditors' rights and stockholders' rights;\n\u2022 risk of loss due to disease and other potential endemic health issues; and\n\u2022 loss of access to government controlled infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, rails, ports, power sources and water supply.\nIn addition, many of our operators are organized outside of the United States. Our royalty and stream interests may be subject to the application of foreign laws to our operators, and their stockholders, including laws relating to foreign ownership structures, corporate transactions, creditors' rights, bankruptcy and liquidation. Foreign operations also could be adversely impacted by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation.\nThese risks may limit or disrupt operating mines or projects on which we hold royalty and stream interests, restrict the movement of funds, or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Certain of these risks may increase in an environment of relatively high metal prices.\nOpposition from indigenous people may delay or suspend development or operations at the properties where we hold royalty and stream interests, which could decrease our revenues.\nVarious international and national, state and provincial laws, regulations and other materials relate to the rights of indigenous peoples. Some of the properties where we hold royalty and stream interests are located in areas presently or previously inhabited or used by indigenous peoples. Many of these laws impose obligations on government to respect the rights of indigenous people. Some mandate that government consult with indigenous people regarding government actions which may affect indigenous people, including actions to approve or grant mining rights or permits. One or more groups of indigenous people may oppose continued operation, further development, or new development of the properties where we hold royalty and stream interests. Such opposition may be directed through legal or administrative proceedings or protests, roadblocks or other forms of public expression, and claims and protests of indigenous peoples may disrupt or delay activities of the operators of the properties. For example, the Pascua-Lama and El Morro projects have been challenged by Chilean indigenous groups and other third parties. During the fourth calendar quarter of 2013, Barrick suspended construction activities at the Pascua-Lama project, except for those activities required for environmental and regulatory compliance, as discussed further in Part I, Item 2, Properties under the heading \"Pascua-Lama Project (Region III, Chile).\" Similarly, construction activities at the El Morro project were suspended during the same period.\nChanges in mining taxes and royalties payable to governments could decrease our revenues.\nChanges in mining and tax laws in any of the United States, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Mexico or any other country in which we have royalty and stream interests in mines or projects could affect mine development and expansion, significantly increase regulatory obligations and compliance costs with respect to mine development and mine operations, increase the cost of holding mining tenures or impose additional taxes on mining operations, all of which could adversely affect our revenue from such properties. A number of properties where we hold royalty interests are located on U.S. public lands that are subject to federal mining and other public land laws. In recent years, the United States Congress has considered a number of proposed major revisions to the General Mining Law, which governs the creation, maintenance and possession of mining claims and related activities on\npublic lands in the United States. Congress also has recently considered bills, which if enacted, would impose a royalty payable to the government on hardrock production, increase land holding fees, impose federal reclamation fees, impose additional environmental operating standards and afford greater public involvement and regulatory discretion in the mine permitting process. Such legislation, if enacted, or similar legislation in other countries, could adversely affect the development of new mines and the expansion of existing mines, as well as increase the cost of all mining operations, and could materially and adversely affect mine operators and our revenue.\nChanges in United States tax legislation or our plans regarding our foreign earnings could adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Currently, the majority of our revenue is generated from royalty and stream interests located outside the United States. Present U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings for one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of that subsidiary. The current Executive branch of the U.S. government has proposed various international tax measures, some of which, if enacted into law, would substantially reduce our ability to defer United States taxes on such indefinitely reinvested non-United States earnings, eliminate certain tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the United States and/or otherwise cause the total tax cost of U.S. multinational corporations to increase. If these or similar proposals are enacted in current or future years, they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, the possibility exists that amounts determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States may ultimately be repatriated. Any repatriation of foreign earnings may require the accrual and payment of U.S. federal and certain state taxes, which could negatively impact our results of operations and/or the amount of available funds. While we currently have no intention to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries, should the need arise domestically, there is no guarantee that we could do so without adverse consequences.\nThe mining industry is subject to significant environmental risks in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where our interests are located.\nMining is subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production. Laws and regulations in the United States and abroad intended to ensure the protection of the environment are constantly changing and evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. Furthermore, mining may be subject to significant environmental and other permitting requirements regarding the use of raw materials needed for operations, particularly water and power. Compliance with such laws and regulations can require significant expenditures and a breach may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, which may be material. If an operator is forced to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations or becomes subject to environmental restrictions that limit its ability to continue or expand operations, or if an operator were to lose its right to use or access water or other raw materials necessary to operate a mine, our revenues could be reduced, delayed or eliminated. These risks are most salient with regard to our development stage properties where permitting may not be complete and/or where new legislation and regulation can lead to delays, interruptions and significant unexpected cost burdens for mine operators. For example, Argentina passed a federal glacier protection law in 2010 that, if strictly applied, could restrict mining activities in areas on or near the nation's glaciers. We have royalties on the Chilean side of the Pascua-Lama project, which straddles the border between Chile and Argentina, and the glacier law, if and when it becomes effective, could affect some aspects of the design, development and operation of the\nPascua-Lama project. In July 2012, the National Supreme Court of Justice of Argentina overturned preliminary injunctions suspending the application of the glacier law in the San Juan Province, where a portion of the Pascua-Lama project is located, but the Supreme Court must still rule on the constitutionality of the glacier law. Further, to the extent that we become subject to environmental liabilities for any time period during which we operated properties, the satisfaction of any liabilities would reduce funds otherwise available to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRegulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs to the operators of the properties on which we have royalty or stream interests.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change. The December 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which has been extended to 2020, establishes a set of greenhouse gas emission targets for countries that have ratified the Protocol, which include Ghana, Australia and Peru. Canada ratified the Protocol but renounced its ratification in December 2011. Furthermore, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has promulgated or is in the process of promulgating several rules aimed at regulating greenhouse gas emissions from new and existing sources, particularly in the power generation sector, and several U.S. states (such as California) have enacted legislation requiring greenhouse gas reductions that will affect energy prices and demand for carbon intensive products. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on the operators of properties where we hold royalty or stream interests, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. If an operator of a property on which we have a royalty or stream interest is forced to incur significant costs to comply with climate change regulation or becomes subject to environmental restrictions that limit its ability to continue or expand operations, our revenues from that property could be reduced, delayed or eliminated.\nWe depend on the services of our President and Chief Executive Officer and other key employees.\nWe believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key executive management personnel. Tony Jensen has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer since July 2006. Mr. Jensen's extensive commercial experience, mine operations background and industry contacts give us an important competitive advantage. The loss of the services of Mr. Jensen, other key members of management or other key employees could jeopardize our ability to maintain our competitive position in the industry. From time to time, we may also need to identify and retain additional skilled management and specialized technical personnel to efficiently operate our business. The number of persons skilled in the acquisition, exploration and development of royalty and stream interests is limited and there is competition for such persons. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to our success and there can be no assurance of such success. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, our ability to execute our business model and growth strategy could be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We currently do not have key person life insurance for any of our officers or directors.\nOur disclosure controls and internal control over our financial reporting are subject to inherent limitations.\nManagement has concluded that as of June 30, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were effective. Such controls and procedures, however, may not be adequate to prevent or identify existing or future internal control weaknesses due to inherent limitations therein, which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to, our dependence on operators for the calculation of royalty payments and deliveries of metal streams that\ntranslate to our revenues as discussed above in \"We depend on our operators for the calculation of payments of our royalty and stream interests. We may not be able to detect errors and later payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments\". Given our dependence on third party calculations, there is a risk that material misstatements in results of operations and financial condition may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by our internal controls over financial reporting and may require us to restate our financial statements.\nWe have incurred indebtedness in connection with our business and may in the future incur additional indebtedness that could limit cash flow available for our operations, limit our ability to borrow additional funds and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs of June 30, 2015, we had $370 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.875% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the \"2019 Notes\") outstanding, which we incurred in June 2012. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in connection with financing acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. As of June 30, 2015, we had $650 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility, and since June 30, 2015, we have entered into several transactions that, when added to existing commitments, would result in drawing down our revolving credit facility and reducing our available liquidity to approximately $350 million after closing all such transactions. As a result, we may seek additional debt or equity financing if we deem it advisable. Our indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate enough cash to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness.\nOur indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, it could:\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions of royalty and stream interests, working capital, pay dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness;\n\u2022 dilute our existing stockholders if we elect to issue common stock instead of paying cash in the event the holders convert the 2019 Notes, or any other convertible securities issued in the future;\n\u2022 require the consent of our existing lenders to borrow additional funds, as was required in connection with the issuance of the 2019 Notes; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains, and the agreements that may govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Among other restrictions, the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting our ability to make certain investments, consummate certain mergers, incur certain debt or liens and dispose of assets.\nWe may be required to pay a significant amount of money or issue a significant amount of shares of our common stock or both upon the exercise of any put, redemption or call right and conversion of the 2019 Notes, which could dilute existing stockholders and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nHolders of the 2019 Notes may convert their 2019 Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2019, but only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after June 30, 2012 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five consecutive business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \"measurement period\") in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of such measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events; or (4) if we call any 2019 Notes for redemption, at any time until the close of business on the business day preceding the redemption date. On or after March 15, 2019 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the June 15, 2019 maturity date, holders may convert their 2019 Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.\nOn or after June 15, 2015, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending within 10 trading days immediately prior to the date we provide the notice of redemption exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price of the 2019 Notes on each applicable trading day, subject to certain limited exceptions, we may redeem any or all of the 2019 Notes. The redemption price for the 2019 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date will equal 100% of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus $90 per each $1,000 principal amount of 2019 Notes being redeemed. If we call any 2019 Notes for redemption, holders may convert their 2019 Notes at any time until the close of business on the business day preceding the redemption date.\nUpon conversion of any of the 2019 Notes, whether upon maturity, the exercise of any put, call or redemption right, or otherwise, we will be required to pay or deliver, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. Any such payment or delivery of cash, shares or a combination of cash and shares upon conversion of the 2019 Notes could dilute existing stockholders and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the risk that we will be unable to refinance our indebtedness when it becomes due, or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our indebtedness. As of June 30, 2015, our annual debt service obligation on the 2019 Notes was approximately $10.6 million. In addition, the 2019 Notes include provisions providing for the lump sum payment of significant amounts of principal, whether upon maturity, upon the exercise of any applicable put, redemption or call rights or otherwise and all amounts, if any, due under our revolving credit facility are due at maturity. Our ability to make these payments when due will depend upon several factors, which may not be in our control. These factors include our liquidity or our ability to liquidate assets owned by us on or prior to such put, redemption, call or maturity dates and the amount by which we have been able to reduce indebtedness prior to such\ndate though exchanges, refinancing, extensions, collateralization or other similar transactions (any of which transactions may also have the effect of reducing liquidity or liquid assets). In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations, which may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our other debt obligations.\nIf we are unable to maintain cash reserves or generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments, or if we fail to comply with the various covenants and requirements of the 2019 Notes, our revolving credit facility or any indebtedness which we may incur in the future, this could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt. Any default under the 2019 Notes, our revolving credit facility or any indebtedness which we may incur in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2019 Notes, could have a material effect on our reported net income, net working capital or other financial results.\nUnder the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Section 470-20, Debt with Conversion and other Options (\"ASC 470-20\"), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the 2019 Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 2019 Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2019 Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the 2019 Notes to their face amount over the term of the 2019 Notes. We report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period's amortization of the debt discount and the instrument's coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2019 Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the 2019 Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2019 Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the 2019 Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may continue to be volatile and could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may decline in the future. The high and low sale prices of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market were $100.84 and $38.63 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, $76.85 and $40.45 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, and\n$82.84 and $55.55 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015. The fluctuation of the market price of our common stock has been affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 market prices of gold, silver, copper, nickel and other metals;\n\u2022 Central Bank interest rates;\n\u2022 expectations regarding inflation;\n\u2022 ability of operators to advance development projects, produce precious metals and develop new reserves;\n\u2022 currency values;\n\u2022 credit market conditions;\n\u2022 general stock market conditions; and\n\u2022 global and regional political and economic conditions.\nAdditional issuances of equity securities by us could dilute our existing stockholders, reduce some or all of our per share financial measures, reduce the trading price of our common stock or impede our ability to raise future capital. Substantial sales of shares may negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue equity in the future in connection with acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. To the extent we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders could be diluted and some or all of our per share financial measures could be reduced. In addition, the shares of common stock that we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions. The market price of our common stock could decline if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issued upon the conversion of the outstanding 2019 Notes or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner. In addition, the existence of the 2019 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2019 Notes could depress the price of our common stock. These sales also could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the then-prevailing market price of our common stock.\nConversion of the 2019 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nAt our election, we may settle the 2019 Notes tendered for conversion entirely or partly in shares of our common stock. An aggregate of approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock are issuable upon conversion of the outstanding 2019 Notes at the initial conversion rate of 9.4955 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $105.31 per share of common stock). In addition, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, and therefore the dilution of existing common stockholders, could increase under certain circumstances described in the indenture under which the 2019 Notes are governed. We may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. As a result, the conversion of some or all of the 2019 Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nWe may change our practice of paying dividends.\nWe have paid a cash dividend on our common stock for each fiscal year beginning in fiscal year 2000. Our board of directors has discretion in determining whether to declare a dividend based on a number of factors, including prevailing gold prices, economic market conditions, future earnings, cash\nflows, financial condition, and funding requirements for future opportunities or operations. In addition, there may be corporate law limitations or future contractual restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. If our board of directors declines or is unable to declare dividends in the future or reduces the current dividend level, our stock price could fall, and the success of an investment in our common stock would depend largely upon any future stock price appreciation. We have increased our dividends in prior years. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to do so or that we will pay any dividends at all.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law, our organizational documents, our rights plan and the indenture governing the 2019 Notes could impede, delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law, our organizational documents, our rights plans and the indenture governing the 2019 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Delaware law prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any \"interested stockholder,\" which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation's voting stock, for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Additionally, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could similarly delay, defer or discourage a change in control of us or management. These provisions could also discourage a proxy contest and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. Such provisions provide for the following, among other things: (i) the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval, (ii) the ability of our board of directors to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued preferred stock, (iii) a board of directors divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three year terms, (iv) permitting only the chairman of the board of directors, chief executive officer, president or board of directors to call a stockholders' meeting and (v) requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals and related information. Furthermore, we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals. The rights issued under the stockholder rights plan could cause significant dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors. In addition, if an acquisition event constitutes a fundamental change, holders of the 2019 Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their 2019 Notes in cash. If an acquisition event constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their 2019 Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. These provisions could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 67847, "SIC": 6795, "TIC": "RGLD"}
