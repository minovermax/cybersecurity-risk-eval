{"cik": "749038", "company": "CCUR Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-09-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following are various material risks we currently face. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our securities. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, the trading prices of our common stock and other securities we may issue in the future could decline significantly. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.\nThe risk factors below contain forward-looking statements regarding CCUR. Actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 1.\n$1.45 million of the net proceeds that we received from the sale of the Content Delivery business remains subject to uncertainties.\nPursuant to the CDN APA, $1.45 million of the purchase price payable by Vecima at closing has been placed into escrow and is subject to loss, in whole or in part after the closing, if Vecima successfully asserts claims for indemnification pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the CDN APA. Furthermore, we may have unforeseen liabilities and expenses that must be satisfied from the after-tax net proceeds of the Content Delivery business sale, leaving less to fund our continuing operations.\nThe CDN APA may expose us to contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have agreed to indemnify Vecima for breaches of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by us in the CDN APA for losses arising out of or in connection with excluded assets or excluded liabilities, and for certain other matters. Indemnification claims by Vecima would reduce the amount of the escrow amount that we receive upon termination of our escrow agreement and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Even if the escrow amount is fully paid to us upon termination of the escrow agreement on December 31, 2018 (which amount is subject to reduction for any indemnification claims finalized or pending), we will still be subject to direct payment of any subsequent indemnification claims, if any, permitted under the CDN APA. Other than in the event of fraud or willful misconduct, we will not be obligated to indemnify Vecima for any breach of the representations, warranties or covenants made by us under the CDN APA until the aggregate amount of claims for indemnification exceed $100 thousand. In the event that claims for indemnification for breach of representations, warranties or covenants made by us under the CDN APA exceed this threshold, we will be obligated to indemnify Vecima for any damages or loss resulting from such breach up to five percent (5%) of the final purchase price paid by Vecima pursuant to the CDN APA; provided, however, that this cap does not apply to damages or losses based on or arising out of fraud or willful misconduct.\nThe RT APA may expose us to contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have agreed to indemnify the RT Purchaser for breaches of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by us in the RT APA for losses arising out of or in connection with excluded assets or excluded liabilities, and for certain other matters. Indemnification claims by the RT Purchaser could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Other than in the event of certain specifically identified indemnification claims or claims arising from (i) intentional misrepresentations, fraud or criminal matters or (ii) breaches or inaccuracies of any fundamental representations set forth in the RT APA , we will not be obligated to indemnify the RT Purchaser for any breach of the representations, warranties or covenants made by us under the RT APA until the aggregate amount of claims for indemnification exceed $350 thousand. In the event that claims for indemnification for breach of representations, warranties or covenants made by us under the RT APA exceed this threshold, we will be obligated to indemnify the RT Purchaser for any damages or loss resulting from such breach up to $2 million, provided, however, that this cap does not apply to certain specifically identified indemnification claims and any claims arising out of fraud or breaches and inaccuracies in the fundamental representations set forth in the RT APA.\nStockholders are not guaranteed any of the proceeds from the sales of the Content Delivery and Real-Time businesses.\nOur Board of Directors has instructed the Investment Committee to evaluate options to maximize the value of our continuing operations and assets, including identifying potential business and asset acquisitions that provide opportunities for appreciation in value. If the Investment Committee is unable to identify suitable acquisition or asset targets that are appropriately valued or other business opportunities that will provide increased value for our continuing operations, we may consider alternatives for returning capital to stockholders while we wind up our affairs. If we wind up our affairs and liquidate under applicable law, our NOLs will be forfeited.\nManagement and the Board of Directors could spend or invest the Company\u2019s capital in ways with which some of our stockholders may not agree.\nOur management could spend or invest the Company\u2019s capital in ways with which some of our stockholders may not agree. The Board of Directors may authorize such spending or investment without seeking stockholder approval to the extent permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and/or other applicable governing documents. The investment of the Company\u2019s capital may not yield a favorable return. Investments which yield a higher return may also subject us to incremental risk as compared to government securities or other existing investments.\nThe Company may be subject to additional regulatory rules and regulations as it develops and expands its operations or consummates any business or asset acquisitions, which may cause the Company to incur increased costs to satisfy its compliance requirements or penalties if the Company is unable to satisfy those requirements in a timely manner; the Company may also alter its business structure or status to align its compliance requirements and costs with its continuing operations and business strategy.\nAs the Company develops and expands its continuing operations and considers the acquisition of new business and assets it continues to assess whether (i) such expansion and development of its continuing operations or potential new business opportunities would subject the Company to additional federal or state law rules and regulations and, if so, the expenses and resources necessary to satisfy those compliance requirements and (ii) its continuing compliance requirements and costs are aligned with its continuing operations and business strategy. The Company may incur significant expenses in making such assessments and implementing any modifications designed to bring its further developed and expanded continuing operations and any acquired new businesses and assets into compliance with applicable federal or state rules and regulations that become applicable to the Company as the result of such activity. I If the Company is unable to meet any new compliance requirements or to do so in a timely manner it may face penalties or other enforcement remedies from the applicable regulatory entity.\nFurther, the Company continues to assess its continuing regulatory costs and expenses following the disposition of its prior businesses to determine whether such costs and expenses are aligned with and necessary to its continuing operations, resources and business strategy. The Company may elect to modify its business structure or status, forego a business or acquisition opportunity or take other action it deems appropriate to remain under or obtain exemption from any compliance requirements it deems to be misaligned with its continuing operations, business strategy or resources. Any such changes may initially require significant expenses and staff resources or create uncertainty or negative market perceptions about us or our securities.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be successful in reinvesting the Company\u2019s assets or that the businesses and assets in which we invest, if any, will allow us greater ability to utilize our existing NOLs.\nThere can be no assurance that we will, or we will be able to, identify and successfully complete any business or asset acquisitions. The process to identify potential business opportunities and acquisition targets, to investigate and evaluate the future returns therefrom and business prospects thereof and to negotiate definitive agreements with respect to such transactions on mutually acceptable terms can be time consuming and costly. We have encountered and are likely to continue to encounter intense competition from other companies with similar business objectives to ours, including private equity and venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds, investment firms with significantly greater financial and other resources and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and executing such transactions. Our financial resources and human resources may be relatively limited when contrasted with many of these competitors. As a result, we may be at a competitive disadvantage with such entities as we seek to identify and acquire additional businesses and assets. Further, managing and growing acquired businesses and assets could require higher corporate expenses, which could also affect our ability to offer competitive terms for any potential acquisition of such businesses or assets.\nWhile we believe that there are several categories of target businesses that we could potentially acquire or invest in, our ability to compete to acquire target businesses that are relatively sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. We may need to obtain additional financing in order to consummate future acquisitions and business opportunities and there can be no assurances that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are successful in acquiring additional businesses or assets, there can be no assurances that such businesses or assets will produce results allowing us greater ability to utilize our NOLs.\nIn addition, we will incur operating expenses, resulting from payroll, board fees, legal, audit and tax services, rent and other overhead and professional fees, while we are evaluating business and acquisition opportunities. These expenses may reduce the overall returns realized or at least affect the initial value derived from any acquired businesses or assets or other business transactions.\nWe may consider potential business or asset acquisitions in different industries, and stockholders may have no basis at this time to ascertain the merits or risks of any business or asset that we may ultimately operate or acquire.\nOur business strategy contemplates the potential acquisition of one or more operating businesses or other assets that we believe will provide better returns on equity than our previous businesses and, except for the restriction on our ability to compete with our former Real-Time and Content Delivery businesses (pursuant to the terms of the respective purchase agreements), we are not limited to acquisitions in any particular industry or of any type of business or asset. Accordingly, there is no current basis for stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of a target business or asset with which we may ultimately effect a business combination, acquisition or other investment. Although we will seek to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular business or acquisition opportunity, we cannot assure stockholders that all of the significant risks present in that opportunity will be properly assessed. Even if we properly assess those risks, some of them may be outside of our control or ability to assess. We may pursue business combinations, asset acquisitions or investments that do not require stockholder approval and, in those instances, stockholders will most likely not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any such transaction before we become committed to the transaction.\nResources will be expended in researching potential acquisitions and investments that might not be consummated.\nThe investigation of target businesses and assets and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments have and will continue to require substantial management time and attention in addition to costs for accountants, attorneys and others engaged from time to time to assist management. If a decision is made not to complete a specific business combination, asset acquisition or other investment, the costs incurred up to that point relating to the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable and would be borne by us. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific opportunity, we may fail to consummate the transaction for any number of reasons, including those beyond our control.\nSubsequent to an acquisition or business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our share price, which could cause stockholders to lose some or all of their investments.\nEven if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine or an asset which we acquire, we cannot assure stockholders that this diligence will identify all material issues that may be present with respect to a particular target business or asset, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary and reasonable amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise, and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or associated with a target asset, or by virtue of our obtaining debt financing in connection with our future operations. Accordingly, stockholders could suffer a significant reduction in the value of their shares.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or other securities to complete business combinations or under employee incentive plans. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue shares of our common stock or preferred stock from time to time in their business judgment up to the amount of our then authorized capitalization. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock, and may issue shares of our preferred stock, in order to complete business combinations or under employee incentive plans. These issuances:\n\u00b7 may significantly dilute stockholders\u2019 equity interests;\n\u00b7 may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of our common stock if shares of preferred stock are issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;\n\u00b7 could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our NOLs and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u00b7 may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination or acquire assets, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders' investment in us.\nAlthough we have no commitments as of the date of this report to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur indebtedness, we may choose to incur substantial debt to finance our growth plans. The incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\u00b7 default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination or asset acquisition are insufficient to repay our debt obligations\u037e\n\u00b7 acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach covenants that require the maintenance of financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant\u037e\n\u00b7 our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand\u037e\n\u00b7 our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding\u037e\n\u00b7 our inability to pay any declared dividends on our common stock\u037e\n\u00b7 using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes\u037e\n\u00b7 limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industries in which we operate or intend to operate\u037e\n\u00b7 increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation\u037e and\n\u00b7 limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nWe may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect a business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage the target business.\nWhen evaluating a prospective target business, even with diligent efforts we may not be able to fully assess the performance of the target business\u2019 management either due to necessary restraints on time, resources or information. Moreover, when assessing private companies it may be difficult to assess how well a target company\u2019s management will be able to adjust to operating within the confines of a public company structure. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target's management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target's management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage such business or operate within the confines of a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted.\nWe may attempt to complete business combinations with private companies about which limited information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\nIn pursuing our business acquisition strategy, we may seek to effectuate business combinations with privately held companies. By definition, very little public information exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we expect, if at all.\nWe may be required to expend substantial sums in order to bring the companies we acquire into compliance with the various reporting requirements applicable to public companies and/or to prepare required financial statements, and such efforts may harm our operating results or be unsuccessful altogether.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires our management to assess the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting for the companies we acquire. In order to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we will need to implement or enhance internal control over financial reporting at any company we acquire and evaluate the internal controls. We do not conduct a formal evaluation of companies\u2019 internal control over financial reporting prior to an acquisition. We may be required to hire or engage additional resources and incur substantial costs to implement the necessary new internal controls should we acquire any companies. Any failure to implement required internal controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or increase the risk of material weaknesses in internal controls, which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\nWe may make acquisitions or investments where we do not own all or a majority of the target enterprise.\nWe may make acquisitions or investments where we do not own all or a majority of the target enterprise. We may engage in such acquisitions or make such investments where we desire the target management to continue to have a significant equity incentive to grow and ensure the profitability of the target business. We may also make such acquisitions or investments where we do not have sufficient financial resources to acquire all of the equity in the target company or where the target has price requirements that we are unwilling to meet at the time of the acquisition or investment. Our minority or less than 100% ownership subjects us to risks that we do not completely control the target company and its results of operations, business condition or prospects may be materially adversely impacted by the decisions of the other equity owners or the difficulty of negotiating among equity owners.\nWe will be unable to compete with the Content Delivery business or the Real-Time business for a period of three years after the date of the closing of the sale of each respective business.\nIn connection with the closing of the sale of the Content Delivery business and the closing of the sale of the Real-Time business, we agreed to be bound by restrictive covenants for a period of three years following the closing of each respective transaction, which provide that until the third anniversary following the applicable transaction closing, we will not:\n\u00b7 engage in any activity that competes with the Content Delivery business as it was conducted by us prior to the closing of the sale of the Content Delivery business or the Real-Time business as it was conducted by us prior to the closing of the sale of the Real-Time business;\n\u00b7 solicit or recruit any employees transferred to Vecima or the RT Purchaser; or\n\u00b7 own, manage, operate, assist, invest in or acquire any person or entity that competes with the Content Delivery business or the Real-Time business (except for ownership of 5% or less of the outstanding securities of a publicly traded entity).\nWe incurred net losses in the past and may incur further losses in the future.\nWe incurred losses from continuing operations of $6.8 million and $4.7 million in fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of June 30, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $151.8 million. We may have difficulty sustaining profitable operations and incur additional net losses in the future.\nAny weaknesses identified in our system of internal controls by us or our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have an adverse effect on our business.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting. In future periods, we may identify deficiencies in our system of internal controls over financial reporting that may require remediation. There can be no assurances that any such future deficiencies identified may not be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in future periods. Any control deficiency that we may identify in the future could adversely affect our stock price, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with the trend of increased stockholder activism.\nPublicly-traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company. Given our significant cash and other asset balances as of June 30, 2018, market capitalization and other factors, it is possible that stockholders may in the future attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders would be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA failure to detect fraud in the business could be serious.\nWhile we are confident that we have comprehensive controls in place, there can be no assurances that all business fraud will be detected and/or thwarted. A loss related to fraud, especially an uninsured loss, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe financial impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S. could be materially different from our current estimates and may adversely affect our operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d), which enacted the most comprehensive U.S. tax reform legislation in over thirty years. The TCJA includes numerous changes in the U.S. tax code that could affect our business, such as:\n\u00b7 A permanent reduction to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017;\n\u00b7 New limitations on business deductions, including meals and entertainment expense and interest expense;\n\u00b7 Indefinite carryforward periods for net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017, albeit with a new limitation in usage each year to 80% of taxable income;\n\u00b7 A new approach to the treatment of foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings, including a one-time repatriation tax (\u201cTransition Tax\u201d) on foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings as of November 2, 2017 or December 31, 2017 (the larger of the two dates). This will be followed by a new system for foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings in years beginning after December 31, 2017 for global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d). GILTI will be based on the annual aggregate foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings in excess of certain qualified business asset investment returns.\n\u00b7 Elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) system for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, along with provisions for obtaining a refund for any existing AMT credits no later than tax years beginning before January 1, 2022.\n\u00b7 Creation of a new base-erosion, anti-abuse tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d) and a new taxation mechanism for foreign-derived intangible income (\u201cFDII\u201d) for years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nGiven the complexity of the Act, we have not finalized the accounting for the income tax effects of some of the provisions of the TCJA. This includes the provisional amounts in the fiscal year 2018 financials regarding the remeasurement of deferred tax assets to the new corporate tax rate and the Transition Tax. Additionally, we are working with our tax advisors to analyze the impact of the new GILTI, FDII, and BEAT taxing regimes that are effective beginning for our fiscal year 2019, as well as other provisions of the Act. The final provisional impacts of the Act may materially differ from the estimates provided in the fiscal year 2018 financials due to, among other things: changes in interpretations of the Act, legislative action to address technical corrections to the Act or address other questions from the Act, changes in accounting standards or interpretations related to income taxes, or any change in estimates that we have used in calculating the provisional amounts. As a result, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in our future effective tax rates could affect our future operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are required to periodically review our deferred tax assets and determine whether, based on available evidence, a valuation allowance is necessary. Accordingly, we have performed such evaluation, from time to time, based on historical evidence, trends in profitability, expectations of future taxable income and implemented tax planning strategies.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. In the event we determine that it is appropriate to create a reserve or increase an existing reserve for any such potential liabilities, the amount of the additional reserve is charged as an expense in the period in which it is determined. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment for the applicable period, a further charge to expense in the period such shortfall is determined would result. Such a charge to expense could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations for the applicable period.\nAs of both June 30, 2018 and 2017, our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets are fully reserved. Changes to our business in the future may require a release of our valuation allowances, which would result in additional tax benefits that would improve our net income. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nWe have implemented certain anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe are subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination involving a merger or sale of more than 10% of our assets with any stockholder, including affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s stock except under limited circumstances.\nThere are provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws that also may delay, deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control.\nAdditionally, see the risk factor below that discusses our formal amendment to our certificate of incorporation adopted by our stockholders at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on October 25, 2017 designed to limit our exposure to an ownership change and as further discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities or present other challenges, such as integration issues, for our business, which if not successfully resolved would adversely affect our business.\nWe are currently reviewing acquisition prospects and in the event of any future acquisitions, we could issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, or assume contingent liabilities. These actions could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Acquisitions also entail numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7 difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or services;\n\u00b7 unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7 adverse effects on existing business relationships;\n\u00b7 risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and\n\u00b7 potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate any business, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future. Our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture issuances or repurchases of our equity, or transfers of our equity by third parties, may impair our future ability to use a substantial amount of our existing net operating loss carryforwards.\nFrom time to time we complete an analysis of the ownership changes in our stock pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As of June 30, 2018, the ownership change was 37.40%, compared to 22.3% as of June 30, 2017. Future transactions and the timing of such transactions could cause an additional ownership change for Section 382 income tax purposes. Section 382 limits the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of its common stock over a three-year period, to utilize its NOLs and certain built-in losses or deductions, as of the ownership change date, that are recognized during the five-year period after the ownership change. Such transactions may include, but are not limited to, additional repurchases or issuances of common stock, or acquisitions or sales of shares of CCUR stock by certain holders of our shares, including persons who have held, currently hold or may accumulate in the future five percent or more of our outstanding common stock for their own account. Outside of the rights granted to us through the tax preservation plan approved by stockholders at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, these transactions may be beyond our control particularly if the tax preservation plan expires. If an additional ownership change were to occur for purposes of Section 382, we would be required to calculate a new annual restriction on the use of our NOLs to offset future taxable income. We could lose all or a substantial part of the benefit of our accumulated NOLs if an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 does occur.\nRecently enacted tax legislation may impact our ability to fully utilize any NOLs generated after calendar year 2017 to fully offset our taxable income in future periods.\nBeginning in calendar year 2018, the TCJA generally will, among other things, permit us to offset only 80% (rather than 100%) of our taxable income with any NOLs we generate after calendar year 2017. Net operating losses subject to these limitations may be carried forward by us for use in later years, subject to these limitations. These tax law changes could have the effect of causing us to incur income tax liability sooner than we otherwise would have incurred such liability or, in certain cases, could cause us to incur income tax liability that we might otherwise not have incurred, in the absence of these tax law changes. The TCJA also includes provisions that, beginning in 2018, reduce the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which would lessen any adverse impact of the limitations described in the preceding sentences.\nTrading on the OTCQB Venture Market may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Venture Market operated by the OTC Markets Group. Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB market is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTCQB market is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB market is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a stock exchange like the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, our stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares.\nWe may be unable to relist our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other exchange.\nIf the Board of Directors determines that it is in the best interests of the Company to resume trading our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or trading on another stock exchange if and when we meet the applicable listing requirements, we will need to reapply to Nasdaq or apply to such other exchange to have our stock listed. The application process can be lengthy, and there is no assurance that Nasdaq or such other exchange will relist our common stock. If we are unable to relist our common stock, or even if our common stock is relisted, no assurance can be provided that an active trading market will develop or, if one develops, will continue.\nChanges in market conditions may impact any stock repurchases, and stock repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nOn March 5, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 1 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Repurchases are made at the discretion of management through open market or privately negotiated transactions or any combination of the same. To the extent the Company engages in stock repurchases, such activity is subject to market conditions, such as the trading prices for our stock, as well as the terms of any stock purchase plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 or Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may resolve to discontinue stock repurchases at any time.\nAny repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility. There can be no assurance that the repurchases will be made at the best possible price. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that stock repurchases will create value for stockholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Our stock purchase program is intended to deliver stockholder value over the long-term, but short-term stock price fluctuations can reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nWe may be subject to lawsuits relating to certain transactions in our common stock and derivative securities referencing our common stock by our largest stockholder, JDS1, LLC.\nThe Company was reviewing certain transactions by our stockholder JDS1, LLC in our common stock and derivative securities referencing our common stock to evaluate whether those transactions resulted in JDS1, LLC\u2019s realization of \u201cshort-swing profits,\u201d as such term is defined in the Exchange Act. Short swing profits references certain profits made by Section 16 filers within a six-month period that are subject to disgorgement under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. JDS1, LLC has previously disgorged short-swing profits to us that were subject to disgorgement. We received letters from counsel to two purported stockholders regarding the transactions under review. Our Board of Directors established a special committee consisting of directors David Nicol and Dilip Singh (the \u201cSpecial Committee\u201d) to review whether any additional amounts were subject to disgorgement and oversee recovery of any such amounts. The Special Committee determined that additional amounts were subject to disgorgement and those amounts were subsequently recovered from JDS1, LLC. Upon concluding its evaluation of the relevant transactions, the Special Committee was dissolved. The stockholders that contacted the Company regarding the transactions of JDS1, LLC may still decide to pursue litigation in order to disgorge additional amounts if they disagree with the Special Committee\u2019s determination. Any litigation that arises because of the transactions reviewed by the Special Committee may require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources.\nWe may be subject to price risk associated with equity securities, fixed maturity debt securities and loans involved in our real estate operations.\nWe are exposed to market risks and fluctuations primarily through changes in fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities in which the Company holds. We follow an investment strategy approved by our Board of Directors\u2019 Investment Committee which sets restrictions on the amount of certain securities and other assets that we may acquire and our overall investment strategy.\nMarket prices for fixed maturity and equity securities are subject to fluctuation, as a result, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Because our fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale, the hypothetical decline would not affect current earnings except to the extent that the decline reflects an \u201cother-than-temporary\u201d impairment.\nWe are also subject to risks and fluctuations in the market prices in the real estate market based on the secured real estate loans and assets that the Company holds as a part of its real estate operations. As a result, the amount that the Company may be able to realize upon default of any of its loans collateralized by real property may significantly differ from the reported market value or the value assessed by the Company.\nTo the extent payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest constitutes a portion of our income, we will be exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash representing such income.\nCertain of our investments include a PIK interest arrangement, which represents contractual interest added to a loan balance and due at the end of such loan\u2019s term. To the extent PIK interest constitutes a portion of our income, we are exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash, including the following:\n\u2022 The higher interest rates of PIK instruments reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with these instruments, and PIK instruments generally represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans.\n\u2022 Even if the accounting conditions for income accrual are met, the borrower could still default when our actual collection is supposed to occur at the maturity of the obligation.\n\u2022 PIK instruments may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral.", "PERMNO": 51829, "SIC": 6500, "TIC": "CCUR"}
