RISK FACTORS\nThe Company's operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below. Other risks are described in \"Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets and Regulations,\" \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\" The Company's business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be immaterial. If any of these risks actually occur, it could materially harm the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations or impair the Company's ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled. In that case, the market price of the Company's common stock could decline. The following risk factors are summarized as general business and industry; operational; financial; health, safety and environmental; regulatory and risks associated with acquisitions.\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nGeneral Business and Industry Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related developments in the global oil markets have had, and depending on the progression of the pandemic, may continue to have, material adverse consequences for general economic, business and industry conditions and for the Company's operations, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and those of its purchasers, suppliers and other counterparties.\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility in the financial markets. In addition, the onset of the pandemic resulted in widespread travel restrictions, business closures and other restrictions that led to a significant reduction in demand for oil, NGL and gas, resulting in oil prices declining significantly in the first quarter of 2020. While demand for and prices for oil, NGLs and gas have generally improved during 2021 as travel restrictions, business closures and other restrictions were lifted, an increase in infections or the onset of a new variant of the virus could again reduce demand for and prices of oil, NGLs and gas. If this were to continue for a prolonged period, the Company, similar to the steps it took at the onset of the pandemic in 2020, may have to make changes to its operations and capital budgets, and the Company's operations, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected. Risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022An extended decline in commodity prices could materially and adversely affect the amount of oil, NGLs and gas that the Company can produce economically, which may result in (i) the Company having to make significant downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves and (ii) a shortfall in expected cash flows, which could require the Company to reduce capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall. In addition, the continuation of depressed prices may adversely affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or repurchase shares of common stock in the future.\n\u2022A reduced demand for oil, combined with an oversupply of oil, would likely result in an oil surplus in the United States and worldwide. If the global demand for oil exports to foreign markets, or if the price that can be obtained in foreign markets does not support the transportation and other costs to reach those destinations, it may be uneconomical to invest in new wells and may cause the Company to shut in producing wells. The Company cannot be certain whether shut-in wells can successfully return to pre-shut-in production levels or that the costs required to return the wells to production will be economical.\n\u2022The Company's ability to develop and sell its production could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient processing, fractionation, refining, transportation, storage or export facilities to the Company. For example, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, oil storage in the United States was, at times, near full capacity in many locations. If this were to again occur for an extended period, the Company's purchasers might decline to purchase the Company's oil, NGLs and gas, and the Company may not be able to store its production. Such a lack of market for or storage capacity for the Company's products could require that the Company shut in some portion of its production. The amount of oil in storage may also keep oil prices at low levels for an extended period, even after demand begins to rise.\n\u2022Under Texas law, the Texas Railroad Commission is empowered to prorate oil production in the state based on market demand. If the Texas Railroad Commission finds that waste is taking place or is reasonably imminent, it is empowered to adopt a rule or order to correct, prevent, or lessen the waste. If the Texas Railroad Commission imposes proration in the future, or if any other similar laws or regulations are imposed, those restrictions would limit the amount of oil, NGLs and gas the Company can produce.\n\u2022It is possible that any delay, reduction or curtailment of the Company's development and producing operations, whether due to regulatory actions or actions by the Company in reaction to market conditions, could result in the loss of acreage through lease expiration.\n\u2022Market conditions resulting from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, low oil prices, or a negative or recessionary economy could also increase the risk that the purchasers of the Company's production, lenders under its credit agreement, counterparties to its derivative instruments, and service providers may be unable to fulfill their obligations in a timely manner, or at all. If any such counterparty were to default on its obligations, such a default could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\n\u2022The Company performs assessments of its proved and unproved oil and gas properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of the Company's proved oil and gas properties, an impairment charge could be required to reduce the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties to their fair value. In addition, goodwill is assessed for impairment whenever it is likely that events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.\n\u2022The Company's operations may be adversely affected if significant portions of its workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, social distancing, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nPrevention (\"CDC\"), has implemented workplace restrictions, including guidance for employees to work remotely for health and safety reasons, where possible. As some employees may have been or may in the future be placed in workplaces where exposure to COVID-19 is possible, the Company may be subject to risk of liability should such employees allege that the Company failed to adequately mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19, to the extent obligated to do so. In addition, in order to facilitate remote working arrangements, some employees are accessing workspaces from their personal devices through cloud-based systems, which could increase cybersecurity risks to the Company and to its employees. There can be no assurance that the Company's operations will not be curtailed or suspended or otherwise adversely affected due to such workforce issues.\nThe Company is not able to predict the ultimate long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business, which will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that are beyond the Company's control, including the length of time that the pandemic continues, the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the COVID-19 virus, the impact of the pandemic and its aftermath on the demand for oil, NGLs and gas, the response of the overall economy and the financial markets as well as the effect of governmental actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDeclining general economic, business or industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\nThe economies in the United States and certain countries in Europe and Asia have been growing, with resulting improvements in industrial demand and consumer confidence. However, other economies, such as those of certain South American nations, continue to face economic struggles or slowing economic growth. If these conditions worsen, combined with a decline in economic growth in other parts of the world, there could be a significant adverse effect on global financial markets and commodity prices. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East, and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy. Global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the Company by (i) reducing demand for its oil, NGL and gas because of reduced global or national economic activity, (ii) impairing its supply chain (for example, by limiting manufacturing of materials used in operations), and (iii) affecting the health of its workforce, rendering employees unable to work or travel. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad were to deteriorate, demand for petroleum products could diminish or stagnate, which could depress the prices at which the Company could sell its oil, NGLs and gas, affect the ability of the Company's vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately decrease the Company's cash flows and profitability. In addition, reduced worldwide demand for debt and equity securities issued by oil and gas companies may make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital to fund its operations or refinance its debt obligations.\nThe Company may be unable to make attractive acquisitions and any acquisition it completes is subject to substantial risks that could materially and adversely affect its business.\nAcquisitions of oil and gas properties, including acreage trades, have from time to time contributed to the Company's growth. Acquisition opportunities in the oil and gas industry are very competitive, which can increase the cost of, or cause the Company to refrain from, completing acquisitions. The success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors and involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022the inability to accurately forecast future commodity prices and estimate the costs to develop the acquired reserves, the recoverable volumes of the acquired reserves, rates of future production and future net cash flows attainable from the acquired reserves;\n\u2022the assumption of unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and losses or costs for which the Company is not indemnified or for which the indemnity the Company receives is inadequate;\n\u2022the validity of assumptions about costs, including synergies;\n\u2022the effect on the Company's liquidity or financial leverage of using available cash or debt to finance acquisitions or from the amount of debt assumed as part of the acquisition;\n\u2022the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the Company's growing business and assets.\nAll of these factors affect whether an acquisition will ultimately generate cash flows sufficient to provide a suitable return on investment. Even though the Company performs a review of the properties it seeks to acquire that it believes is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are often limited in scope. As a result, among other risks, the Company's initial estimates of reserves may be subject to revision following an acquisition, which may materially and adversely affect the desired benefits of the acquisition. See \"Risks Associated with Acquisitions\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for additional information.\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nThe Company's ability to complete dispositions of assets or sell partial interests in assets may be subject to factors beyond its control, and in certain cases the Company may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters.\nThe Company regularly reviews its property base for the purpose of identifying nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies. In addition, from time to time, the Company sells an interest in its oil and gas properties for the purpose of assisting or accelerating the asset's development. Various factors could materially affect the ability of the Company to dispose of such nonstrategic assets or partial interests or complete announced dispositions, including the receipt of approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the nonstrategic assets or partial interests on terms and at prices acceptable to the Company.\nSellers typically retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain pre-closing matters, such as matters of litigation, environmental contingencies, royalty obligations and income taxes. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release the Company from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a divestiture, the Company may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.\nThe Company's operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the Midland Basin of West Texas, an area of high industry activity, which may affect its ability to obtain the personnel, equipment, services, resources and facilities access needed to complete its development activities as planned or result in increased costs; such concentration also makes the Company vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited geographic area.\nThe Company's producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Midland Basin of West Texas. Industry activity is high in the Midland Basin and demand for and costs of personnel, equipment, power, services and resources remains high. Any delay or inability to secure the personnel, equipment, power, services and resources could result in oil, NGL and gas production volumes being below the Company's forecasted volumes. In addition, any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flow and profitability.\nAs a result of this concentration, the Company may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of operations or production in this area caused by external factors such as governmental regulation, state politics, market limitations, produced water disposal limitations, water or sand shortages, or extreme weather related conditions.\nThe Company may not be able to obtain access on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise to gathering systems, pipelines and other processing, fractionation, refining, storage, transportation and export facilities to market its oil, NGL and gas production.\nThe marketing of oil, NGL and gas production depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and other processing, fractionation, refining, storage, transportation and export facilities, as well as the existence of adequate markets. If there were insufficient capacity available on these systems, if these systems were unavailable to the Company or if access to these systems were to become commercially unreasonable, the price offered for the Company's production could be significantly depressed, or the Company could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons while it constructs its own facility or awaits the availability of third party facilities. The Company also relies (and expects to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by third parties in order to gather, store, process, transport, fractionate, refine, export and sell its oil, NGL and gas production. The Company's plans to develop and sell production from its oil and gas reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient gathering, transportation, storage, processing, fractionation, refining or export facilities to the Company, especially in areas of planned expansion where such facilities do not currently exist. Additionally, certain of these challenges may be compounded by a high level of industry activity in the Permian Basin.\nFor example, following Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, certain Permian Basin gas processors were forced to shut down their plants due to the inability of certain Texas Gulf Coast NGL fractionators to operate. The Company was able to produce its oil wells and vent or flare the associated gas; however, there is no certainty the Company will vent or flare gas in the future as a result of its emissions reduction efforts and potential changes in regulations. The amount of oil and gas that can be produced is subject to limitations in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to gathering, transportation, storage, processing, fractionation, refining or export facilities, or lack of capacity at such facilities. The Company has periodically experienced high line pressure at its tank batteries, which has occasionally led to the flaring of gas due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas to support the increased gas production. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nlast for a few days, and in many cases, the Company may be provided only limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration.\nTo the extent that the Company enters into transportation contracts with pipelines that are subject to the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") regulation, the Company is subject to FERC requirements related to use of such capacity. Any failure on the Company's part to comply with FERC's regulations and policies related to pipeline transportation, reporting requirements or other regulations, and any failure to comply with a FERC-related pipeline's tariff, could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties. In addition, any changes in FERC or state regulations or requirements on pipeline transportation may result in increased transportation costs on pipelines that are subject to such regulation, thereby negatively impacting the Company's profitability.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of purchasers for a majority of its products.\nA limited number of companies purchase a majority of the Company's oil, NGL and gas. The loss of a significant purchaser could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to sell its production.\nThe refining industry and export facilities may be unable to absorb U.S. oil production, and the ability to export oil is subject to suspension; in any such case, the resulting surplus could depress prices and restrict the availability of markets, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nAbsent an expansion of U.S. refining and export capacity, an increase in U.S. production of oil could result in a surplus of these products in the U.S., which would likely cause prices for these commodities to fall and markets to constrict. Although U.S. law was changed in 2015 to permit the export of oil, exports may not occur if demand is lacking in foreign markets or the price that can be obtained in foreign markets does not support associated export capacity expansions, transportation and other costs. In such circumstances, the rate of return on the Company's capital projects would decline, possibly to levels that would make execution of the Company's drilling plans uneconomical, and a lack of market for the Company's products could require that the Company shut in some portion of its production. If this were to occur, the Company's production and cash flow could decrease, or could increase less than forecasted, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's cash flow and profitability.\nUnder the 2015 federal law that lifted the ban on U.S. exports of oil, the President, in certain limited circumstances, has the authority to impose export licensing requirements or other restrictions on exports of oil from the U.S. for an initial period of up to one year, subject to extension. Such a limitation could result in a surplus of oil in the U.S., which would likely cause U.S. oil prices to fall.\nEstimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities and net cash flows of the Company's proved reserves may prove to be lower than estimated.\nNumerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net cash flows therefrom. The estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows set forth in this Report are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.\nPetroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and estimates of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including the following:\n\u2022historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;\n\u2022the quality and quantity of available data;\n\u2022the interpretation of that data;\n\u2022the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;\n\u2022assumptions concerning future commodity prices; and\n\u2022assumptions concerning future development costs, operating costs, severance, ad valorem and excise taxes, gathering, processing, transportation and fractionation costs and workover and remedial costs.\nBecause all proved reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves:\n\u2022the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered;\n\u2022the production costs incurred to recover the reserves;\n\u2022the amount and timing of future development expenditures; and\n\u2022future commodity prices.\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nFurthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of proved reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. The Company's actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to proved reserves will likely differ from the estimates, and the differences may be material.\nAs required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on average prices preceding the date of the estimate and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022the amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022the level of future capital spending;\n\u2022increases or decreases in the supply of or demand for oil, NGL and gas; and\n\u2022changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nStandardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In general, it requires the use of commodity prices that are based upon a historical 12-month unweighted average, as well as operating and development costs being incurred at the end of the reporting period. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for future oil and gas production because of seasonal price fluctuations or other varying market conditions, nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. In addition, the ten percent discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company or the oil and gas industry in general. Therefore, the estimates of discounted future net cash flows or Standardized Measure in this Report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value of the Company's proved reserves.\nBecause the Company's producing wells decline continually over time, the Company will need to mitigate these declines through drilling and production enhancement initiatives and/or acquisitions.\nProducing oil and gas reservoirs are characterized by declining production rates, which vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Because the Company's producing wells decline continually over time as those wells are produced, the Company will need to mitigate these declines through drilling and production enhancement initiatives and/or acquisitions of additional recoverable reserves. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace its current or future production.\nA portion of the Company's total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 were undeveloped, and those proved reserves may not ultimately be developed.\nAs of December 31, 2021, 12 percent of the Company's total estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped proved reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling. The Company's reserve data assumes that the Company can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, which assumptions may not prove to be correct. If the Company chooses not to spend the capital to develop these proved undeveloped reserves, or if the Company is not otherwise able to successfully develop these proved undeveloped reserves, the Company will be required to write-off these proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC's rules, because proved undeveloped reserves may be booked only if they relate to wells planned to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, the Company may be required to write-off any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed within this five-year timeframe. The Company's future production levels and, therefore, its future cash flow and profitability will be impacted if it is not able to successfully develop its undeveloped leasehold acreage.\nA substantial portion of the Company's acreage is currently held under leases that require it to establish and maintain production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities, and such leases are typically held by production from horizontal wells and/or older, lower-producing vertical wells. Unless production in paying quantities is maintained from existing lease-holding wells, or is established during the primary term of the lease and then maintained thereafter with respect to these leases, the leases will terminate, and the Company will lose the right to develop the undeveloped leasehold acreage.\nThe Company faces significant competition and some of its competitors have resources in excess of the Company's available resources.\nThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with a large number of companies, producers and operators in a number of areas such as:\n\u2022seeking to acquire oil and gas properties suitable for exploration or development;\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\n\u2022marketing oil, NGL and gas production; and\n\u2022seeking to acquire the equipment, services and expertise, including trained personnel, necessary to identify, evaluate, develop and operate its properties.\nSome of the Company's competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company, and as such, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage in the identification, acquisition and development of properties that complement the Company's operations. The Company also faces competition from companies that supply alternative sources of energy, such as wind, solar power or other renewable energy. Competition is expected to increase and in certain cases, governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. Governments and other parties are also promoting research into new technologies to accelerate the implementation of alternative energy sources.\nThe Company's business could be materially and adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and gas producer, the Company faces various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to, or control of, sensitive information or to render data or systems corrupted or unusable; threats to the security of the Company's facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected the Company's operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. In particular, the Company's implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for the Company's information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Costs for insurance have also increased as a result of security threats, and insurance coverage has become more difficult to obtain, and may not be available at prices acceptable to the Company or at all. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to the Company's operations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated. The Company relies extensively on information technology systems, including internet sites, computer software, data hosting facilities and other hardware and software platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties, to assist in conducting its business. The Company's technologies systems and networks, and those of its business associates may become the target of cybersecurity attacks, including without limitation denial-of-service attacks, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access, cyber or phishing-attacks, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems and materially and adversely affect the Company in a variety of ways, including the following:\n\u2022unauthorized access to and release of seismic data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to compete for oil and gas resources;\n\u2022data corruption, communication interruption or other operational disruptions during drilling activities, which could result in the failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;\n\u2022data corruption or operational disruptions of production infrastructure, which could result in loss of production or accidental discharges;\n\u2022unauthorized access to and release of personal information of royalty owners, employees and vendors, or the data or confidential information of customers, suppliers or other third parties, which could expose the Company to allegations that it did not sufficiently protect that information;\n\u2022a cybersecurity attack on a vendor or service provider, which could result in supply chain disruptions and could delay or halt operations;\n\u2022a cybersecurity attack on third-party gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, refining, storage or export facilities, which could delay or prevent the Company from transporting and marketing its production, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u2022a cybersecurity attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions, which could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing the Company from marketing its production or engaging in derivative activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u2022a cybersecurity attack on a communications network or power grid, which could cause operational disruptions resulting in the loss of revenues; and\n\u2022a cybersecurity attack on the Company's automated and surveillance systems, which could cause a loss in production and potential environmental hazards.\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nThese events could damage the Company's reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability. Additionally, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period of time.\nWhile the Company has experienced cybersecurity events in the past, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, inadvertent data exposures, distributed denial-of-service attacks and phishing-attacks, the Company has not suffered any material losses as a result of such events. However, there is no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the continuing and evolving threat of cybersecurity attacks has resulted in evolving legal and compliance matters, including increased regulatory focus on prevention, which could require the Company to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements.\nProvisions of the Company's charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company's common stock.\nProvisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the Company or a merger in which the Company is not the surviving company and may otherwise prevent or slow changes in the Company's board of directors and management. In addition, because the Company is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions could discourage an acquisition of the Company or other change in control transactions and thereby negatively affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company's common stock.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company's operations involve many operational risks, some of which could result in unforeseen interruptions to the Company's operations and substantial losses to the Company for which the Company may not be adequately insured.\nThe Company's operations, including drilling and completion activities and water distribution, collection and disposal activities, are subject to all the risks incident to the oil and gas development and production business, including:\n\u2022blowouts, cratering, explosions and fires;\n\u2022adverse weather effects;\n\u2022environmental hazards, such as NGL and gas leaks, oil and produced water spills, pipeline and vessel ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials (\"NORM\"), and unauthorized discharges of toxic chemicals, gases, brine, well stimulation and completion fluids or other pollutants onto the surface or into the subsurface environment;\n\u2022high costs, shortages or delivery delays of equipment, labor or other services or materials, such as water and sand for hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022facility or equipment malfunctions, failures or accidents;\n\u2022title problems;\n\u2022pipe or cement failures or casing collapses;\n\u2022uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or water;\n\u2022compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements, including executive actions and regulatory or legislative efforts under a Biden administration;\n\u2022lost or damaged oilfield workover and service tools;\n\u2022surface access restrictions;\n\u2022unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022terrorism, vandalism, extreme physical acts of activism against fossil fuel interests and physical, electronic and cybersecurity breaches and global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of a pandemic or contagious disease, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022natural disasters.\nThe Company's overall exposure to operational risks may increase as its drilling activity expands, along with any associated increases in internally-provided well services, water distribution, water collection, disposal or other services. In addition, any of these risks could adversely impact the Company's service providers and suppliers, causing its supply chain to be interrupted, slowed or rendered inoperable. Any of these risks could result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property and natural resources, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations.\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nThe Company may not be insured or is not fully insured against certain of the risks described above, either because such insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs and deductibles associated with obtaining such insurance. Additionally, the Company relies, to a large extent, on facilities owned and operated by third-parties, and damage to or destruction of those third-party facilities could adversely affect the ability of the Company to produce, gather, process, fractionate, refine, store, transport, export and sell its hydrocarbons.\nExploration and development drilling involve substantial costs and risks and may not result in commercially productive reserves.\nDrilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, or become costlier, as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022unexpected pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022construction delays;\n\u2022fracture stimulation accidents or failures;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022restricted access to land for drilling or laying pipelines;\n\u2022title defects;\n\u2022lack of available gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, storage, refining or export facilities;\n\u2022lack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;\n\u2022access to, and the cost and availability of, the equipment, services, resources and personnel required to complete the Company's drilling, completion and operating activities; and\n\u2022restrictions, delays or cancellations imposed by or resulting from compliance with or changes in environmental and other governmental, regulatory or contractual requirements.\nThe Company's future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, the Company's proved reserves and production would decline, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental, extension or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory and extension drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. The Company expects that it will continue to recognize exploration and abandonments expense in 2022.\nPart of the Company's strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nThe Company's operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by it and its service providers. Risks that the Company faces while drilling horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022landing the wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u2022staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u2022running casing the entire length of the wellbore; and\n\u2022being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nRisks that the Company faces while completing wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u2022the ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u2022the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nDrilling in emerging areas is more uncertain than drilling in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established drilling operations. New discoveries and emerging formations have limited or no production history and, consequently, the Company is more limited in assessing future drilling results in these areas. If the Company's drilling results are worse than anticipated, the return on investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as anticipated and the Company may recognize noncash charges to reduce the carrying value of its unproved properties in those areas.\nThe Company's expectations for future drilling activities will be realized over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of such activities.\nThe Company has identified drilling locations and prospects for future drilling opportunities, including development, exploratory, extension and infill drilling activities. These drilling locations and prospects represent a significant part of the\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nCompany's future drilling plans. For example, the Company's proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 include proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves of 130 MMBbls of oil, 92 MMBbls of NGL and 462 Bcf of gas. The Company's ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability and cost of capital, regulatory approvals, negotiation of agreements with third parties, commodity prices, costs, access to and availability of equipment, services, resources and personnel, and drilling results. There can be no assurance that the Company will drill these locations or that the Company will be able to produce oil or gas reserves from these locations or any other potential drilling locations. Well results vary by formation and geographic area, and the Company generally prioritizes its drilling activities to focus on remaining locations that are believed to offer the highest return. Changes in the laws or regulations on which the Company relies in planning and executing its drilling programs could materially and adversely impact the Company's ability to successfully complete those programs. For example, under current Texas laws and regulations, the Company may receive permits to drill, and may drill and complete, certain horizontal wells that traverse one or more units and/or leases; a change in those laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact the Company's ability to drill those wells. Because of these uncertainties, the Company cannot give any assurance as to the timing of these activities or that they will ultimately result in the realization of proved reserves or meet the Company's expectations for success. As such, the Company's actual drilling activities may materially differ from the Company's current expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's proved reserves, financial condition and results of operations.\nMulti-well pad drilling may result in volatility in the Company's operating results.\nThe Company utilizes multi-well pad drilling, and wells drilled on a pad are not placed on production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed. In addition, problems affecting a single well could adversely affect production from all of the wells on the pad. As a result, multi-well pad drilling can cause delays in the scheduled commencement of production, or interruptions in ongoing production. These delays or interruptions may cause volatility in the Company's operating results. Further, any delay, reduction or curtailment of the Company's development and producing operations due to operational delays caused by multi-well pad drilling could result in the loss of acreage through lease expiration.\nThe Company's operations are substantially dependent upon the availability of water and its ability to dispose of produced water gathered from drilling and production activities. Restrictions on the Company's ability to obtain water or dispose of produced water may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of the Company's drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Limitations or restrictions on the Company's ability to secure sufficient amounts of water (including limitations resulting from natural causes such as drought), could materially and adversely impact its operations. Severe drought conditions can result in local water districts taking steps to restrict the use of water in their jurisdiction for drilling and hydraulic fracturing in order to protect the local water supply. If the Company is unable to obtain water to use in its operations from local sources, it may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the Company must dispose of the fluids produced from oil and gas production operations, including produced water, which it does directly or through the use of third party vendors. The legal requirements related to the disposal of produced water into a non-producing geologic formation by means of underground injection wells are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern arises from seismic events near underground disposal wells that are used for the disposal of produced water resulting from oil and gas activities. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified Texas as being among the states with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or oil and gas extraction. Additionally, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, in Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission has adopted rules governing the permitting or re-permitting of wells used to dispose of produced water and other fluids resulting from the production of oil and gas in order to address these seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the state to modify, suspend or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity.\nIn response to recent seismic activity in the Midland Basin over the past couple of years, the Texas Railroad Commission has pursued a series of actions commencing in the latter half of 2021, including suspending deep disposal activity and curtailing certain shallow disposal activities in the areas of heightened seismic activity. Such restrictions have not had a material impact on the Company's operations to date, but further restrictions across the basin as a result of more stringent regulations or legal directives, potential litigation or other developments could materially impact its ability to dispose of produced water, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nThe Company's use of seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and gas, which could materially and adversely affect the results of its future drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. As a result, the Company's drilling activities may not be successful or economic. In addition, the use of advanced technologies, such as 3-D seismic data, requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and the Company could incur losses as a result of such expenditures.\nThe Company's gas processing and gathering systems are subject to operational and regulatory risks, which could result in significant damages and the loss of revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company owns interests in 11 gas processing plants, including the related gathering systems. There are significant risks associated with the operation of gas processing plants and the associated gathering systems. Gas and NGLs are volatile and explosive and may include carcinogens. Damage to or improper operation of gas processing plants or gathering systems could result in an explosion or the discharge of toxic gases, which could result in significant damage claims in addition to interrupting a revenue source.\nMoreover, while the Company's gas processing and gathering systems generally are not currently subject to FERC or state regulation with respect to rates or terms and conditions of service, there can be no assurance that such processing and gathering operations will continue to be unregulated in the future. Although these facilities may not be directly regulated, other laws and regulations may affect the availability of gas for gathering and processing, such as state regulations regarding production rates and the maximum daily production allowable from gas wells, which could impact the Company's business in these areas. Such regulation could result in additional costs and reduced revenues.\nFinancial Risks\nThe prices of oil, NGLs and gas are highly volatile. A sustained decline in these commodity prices could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's revenues, profitability, cash flow and future rate of growth are highly dependent on commodity prices. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, NGL and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the Company's control, such as:\n\u2022domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for oil, NGL and gas;\n\u2022worldwide oil, NGL and gas inventory levels, including at Cushing, Oklahoma, the benchmark location for WTI oil prices, and the U.S. Gulf Coast, where the majority of the U.S. refinery capacity exists;\n\u2022volatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets;\n\u2022the capacity of U.S. and international refiners to utilize U.S. supplies of oil and condensate;\n\u2022weather conditions;\n\u2022overall domestic and global political and economic conditions, including the imposition of tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions, political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions;\n\u2022global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the recent COVID-19 virus, which may reduce the demand for oil, NGL and gas because of reduced global or national economic activity;\n\u2022actions of OPEC, its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022the price and quantity of oil, NGL and LNG imports to and exports from the U.S.;\n\u2022technological advances or social attitudes or policies affecting energy consumption and energy supply;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental legislative efforts, executive actions and regulations, including environmental regulations, climate change regulations and taxation;\n\u2022the effect of energy conservation efforts;\n\u2022stockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of capital for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and gas;\n\u2022the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering systems, pipelines and other processing, fractionation, refinery, storage and export facilities; and\n\u2022the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels.\nCommodity prices have historically been, and continue to be, extremely volatile. For example, the Brent oil prices in 2021 ranged from a high of $86.40 to a low of $51.09 per Bbl and the NYMEX gas prices in 2021 ranged from a high of $6.31 to a low of $2.45 per MMBtu. The Company expects this volatility to continue. A further or extended decline in commodity prices could materially and adversely affect the Company's future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nor its ability to fund planned capital expenditures, pay dividends or repurchase shares of common stock. The Company makes price assumptions that are used for planning purposes, and a significant portion of the Company's cash outlays, including rent, salaries and noncancellable capital and transportation commitments, are largely fixed in nature. Accordingly, if commodity prices are below the expectations on which these commitments were based, the Company's financial results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected because these cash outlays are not variable in the short-term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to unanticipated decreases in commodity prices.\nSignificant or extended price declines could also materially and adversely affect the amount of oil, NGL and gas that the Company can produce economically, which may result in the Company having to make significant downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves. A reduction in production could also result in a shortfall in expected cash flows and require the Company to reduce capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall. Any of these factors could negatively affect the Company's ability to replace its production and its future rate of growth.\nFuture declines in the price of oil, NGLs and gas could result in a reduction in the carrying value of the Company's proved oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nSignificant or extended price declines could result in the Company having to make downward adjustments to the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties. The Company performs assessments of the recoverability of its oil and gas properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable. In order to perform these assessments, management uses various observable and unobservable inputs, including management's outlooks for (i) proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (ii) commodity prices, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures and (v) production. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of the Company's oil and gas properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore an impairment charge would be required to reduce the carrying value of the proved properties to their fair value. The Company may incur impairment charges in the future, which could materially affect the Company's results of operations in the period incurred. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Impairment of oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets\" and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nThe Company's actual production could differ materially from its forecasts.\nFrom time to time, the Company provides forecasts of expected quantities of future oil and gas production and other financial and operating results. These forecasts are based on a number of estimates and assumptions, including that none of the risks associated with the Company's oil and gas operations summarized in this \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" occur. Production forecasts, specifically, are based on assumptions such as:\n\u2022expectations of production from existing wells and future drilling activity;\n\u2022the absence of facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022the absence of adverse weather effects;\n\u2022expectations of commodity prices, which could experience significant volatility;\n\u2022expected well costs; and\n\u2022the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies, which could make certain drilling activities or production uneconomical.\nShould any of these assumptions prove inaccurate, or should the Company's development plans change, actual production could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company could experience periods of higher costs if commodity prices rise. These increases could reduce the Company's profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as planned.\nHistorically, the Company's capital and operating costs have risen during periods of increasing oil, NGL and gas prices. These cost increases result from a variety of factors beyond the Company's control, such as increases in the cost of electricity, steel and other raw materials that the Company and its vendors rely upon; increased demand for labor, services and materials as drilling activity increases; and increased production and ad valorem taxes. Costs may rise faster than increases in the Company's revenue if commodity prices rise, thereby negatively impacting the Company's profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as scheduled and on budget. This impact may be magnified to the extent that the Company's ability to participate in the commodity price increases is limited by its derivative risk management activities.\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nThe Company is a party to debt instruments, a Credit Facility and other financial commitments that may limit the Company's ability to fund future business and financing activities.\nThe Company is a borrower under fixed rate senior and convertible notes and maintains a Credit Facility that was undrawn as of December 31, 2021. The terms of the Company's borrowings specify scheduled debt repayments and require the Company to comply with certain associated covenants and restrictions. The Company's ability to comply with the debt repayment terms, associated covenants and restrictions is dependent on, among other things, factors outside the Company's direct control, such as commodity prices and interest rates. In addition, from time to time, the Company enters into arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations, including firm purchase, transportation and fractionation commitments, gathering, processing, transportation and storage commitments on uncertain volumes of future throughput, commitments to purchase minimum volumes of goods and services, operating lease agreements and drilling commitments. The Company's financial commitments could have important consequences to its business including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the incurrence of charges associated with unused commitments if actual activities do not meet the Company's expectations at the time such commitments are entered into;\n\u2022increasing its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting its flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in its business and industry;\n\u2022limiting its ability to fund future development activities or engage in future acquisitions; and\n\u2022placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments.\nThe Company's ability to obtain additional financing is also affected by the Company's debt credit ratings and competition for available debt financing. A ratings downgrade could materially and adversely impact the Company's ability to access debt markets, increase the borrowing cost under the Company's Credit Facility and the cost of future debt and potentially require the Company to post letters of credit or other forms of credit support for certain obligations.\nThe Company's return of capital strategies, including its base and variable dividend policy and share repurchase program, may be changed at the discretion of the Company's board of directors, and the Company's ability to declare and pay base and variable dividends and repurchase shares are subject to certain considerations.\nDividends, whether base or variable, are authorized and determined by the Company's board of directors at its sole discretion. The Company's stock repurchase program has no time limit, may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time by the board of directors, and the repurchase of shares pursuant to the stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors are made from time to time based on management's discretion. Decisions regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares are subject to a number of considerations, including:\n\u2022cash available for distribution or repurchases;\n\u2022the Company's results of operations and anticipated future results of operations;\n\u2022the Company's financial condition, especially in relation to its anticipated future capital needs;\n\u2022the level of cash reserves the Company maintains to fund future capital expenditures;\n\u2022the Company's stock price; and\n\u2022other factors the board of directors deems relevant.\nThe frequency and amount of dividends, if any, may vary significantly from amounts paid in previous periods. The Company can provide no assurance that it will continue to pay base or variable dividends or authorize share repurchases at the current rate or at all. Any elimination of or downward revision in the Company's base or variable dividend payout or stock repurchase program could adversely affect the total return of an investment in and have a material adverse effect on the market price, of the Company's common stock.\nA failure by purchasers of the Company's production to satisfy their obligations to the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of purchasers to purchase a majority of its products. To the extent that purchasers of the Company's production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to the Company if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time. If for any reason the Company were to determine that it was probable that some or all of the accounts receivable from any one or more of the purchasers of the Company's production were uncollectible, the Company would recognize a charge in the earnings of that period for the probable loss.\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nThe failure by counterparties to the Company's derivative risk management activities to perform their obligations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\nThe use of derivative risk management transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. The Company is unable to predict changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if the Company accurately predicts sudden changes, the Company's ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions and the contractual terms of the transactions. During periods of declining commodity prices, the Company's derivative receivable positions generally increase, which increases the Company's counterparty credit exposure. In periods of lower commodity prices, if any of the Company's counterparties were to default on its obligations under the Company's derivative arrangements, such a default could (i) have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, (ii) result in a larger percentage of the Company's future production being subject to commodity price changes and (iii) increase the likelihood that the Company's derivative arrangements may not achieve their intended strategic purposes.\nThe Company's derivative risk management activities could result in financial losses, limit the Company's potential gains or fail to protect the Company from declines in commodity prices; the Company may not enter into derivative arrangements with respect to future volumes if prices are unattractive.\nThe Company has historically entered into derivative arrangements covering a portion of its oil, NGL and gas production to mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company's net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value, support the Company's annual capital expenditure plans and planned dividend payments. In addition, Pioneer assumed existing derivative arrangements in the Parsley Acquisition and DoublePoint Acquisition, which are now part of the Company's consolidated derivative arrangements. These derivative arrangements, on a combined basis, are subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment, and the changes in fair market value of the contracts are reported in the Company's statements of operations each quarter, which may result in significant noncash gains or losses.\nWhile intended to reduce the effects of oil, NGL and gas price volatility, the Company's derivative arrangements may limit the Company's potential gains if prices rise over the price established by such arrangements. Conversely, the Company's derivative arrangements may be inadequate to protect the Company from continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil, NGL or gas. Global commodity prices are volatile. Such volatility challenges the Company's ability to forecast the price of oil, NGL and gas, and, as a result, it may become more difficult for the Company to manage its derivative arrangements. In trying to manage its exposure to commodity price risk, the Company may end up with too many or too few derivatives, depending upon where commodity prices settle relative to the Company's derivative price thresholds and how the Company's oil, NGL and gas volumes and production mix fluctuate relative to expectations when the derivatives were entered.\nThe Company's derivative arrangements may also expose the Company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, when:\n\u2022production is less than the contracted derivative volumes;\n\u2022the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligations;\n\u2022there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative contract and actual prices received; or\n\u2022a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts oil and gas prices.\nFailure to protect against declines in commodity prices exposes the Company to reduced liquidity when prices decline. A sustained lower commodity price environment would result in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices at which the Company could enter into derivative contracts on future volumes. The Company has significantly reduced its derivative arrangements for 2022 and beyond; therefore, any decreases in commodity prices for oil, NGLs and gas could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations.\nPioneer's ability to utilize its U.S. net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income taxes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Pioneer had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") of $6.0 billion. Of the total NOLs, $2.2 billion were incurred prior to January 1, 2018 and will begin to expire, if unused, in 2032, and $3.8 billion were incurred on or after January 1, 2018 and will not expire and will be carried forward indefinitely under current tax law. Pioneer's ability to utilize these NOLs and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income depends on many factors, including its future income, which cannot be assured. Section 382 of the Code (\"Section 382\") generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an \"ownership change\" (as determined under Section 382). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders (or groups of stockholders) who are each deemed to own at least five percent of such corporation's stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. In the event that an ownership change occurs, utilization of the relevant corporation's NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\n382, generally determined, subject to certain adjustments, by multiplying (i) the fair market value of such corporation's stock at the time of the ownership change by (ii) a percentage approximately equivalent to the yield on long-term tax-exempt bonds during the month in which the ownership change occurs. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its unproved oil and gas properties to determine recoverability of its cost and could be required to recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company carried unproved oil and gas property costs of $6.1 billion. GAAP requires periodic evaluation of these costs on a project-by-project basis. These evaluations are affected by the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of the leases and the contracts and permits appurtenant to such projects. If the quantity of potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project, the Company will recognize noncash charges in the earnings in the period in which the unproved oil and gas properties is determined to be impaired.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its goodwill for impairment and could be required to recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had a carrying value for goodwill of $243 million. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually during the third quarter and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the Company's goodwill may be impaired, which may require an estimate of the fair values of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities. Those assessments may be affected by (i) positive or negative reserve adjustments, (ii) results of drilling activities, (iii) management's outlook for commodity prices and costs and expenses, (iv) changes in the Company's market capitalization, (v) changes in the Company's weighted average cost of capital and (vi) changes in income taxes. If the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets is not sufficient to fully support the goodwill balance in the future, the Company will reduce the carrying value of goodwill for the impaired value, with a corresponding noncash charge to earnings in the period in which goodwill is determined to be impaired. If incurred, an impairment of the goodwill could result in a material noncash charge to the Company's earnings in the period in which goodwill is determined to be impaired.\nHealth, Safety and Environmental Risks\nThe Company's operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change, energy conservation measures, or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the oil and gas production it provides.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and around the world. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions.\nNo comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, but President Biden has made the combat of climate change arising from GHG emissions a priority under his Administration and has issued, and may continue to issue, executive orders or other regulatory initiatives in pursuit of his regulatory agenda. The EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and gas system sources, and impose new standards reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations through limitations on venting and flaring and the implementation of enhanced emission leak detection and repair requirements. In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of methane emissions. During 2020, the former Trump Administration revised performance standards for methane established in 2016 to lessen the impact of those standards and remove the transmission and storage segments from the source category for certain regulations. However, shortly after taking office in 2021, President Biden issued an executive order calling on the EPA to revisit federal regulations regarding methane and establish new or more stringent standards for existing or new sources in the oil and gas sector, including the transmission and storage segments. The U.S. Congress also passed, and President Biden signed into law, a revocation of the 2020 rulemaking, effectively reinstating the 2016 standards. In response to President Biden's executive order, in November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish Quad Ob new source and Quad Oc first-time existing source standards of performance for methane and volatile organic compound (\"VOC\") emissions in the oil and gas source category. This proposed rule would apply to upstream and midstream facilities at oil and gas well sites, gas gathering and boosting compressor stations, gas processing plants, and transmission and storage facilities. Owners or operators of affected emission units or processes would have to comply with specific standards of performance that may include leak detection using optical gas imaging and subsequent repair requirements, reduction of emissions by 95 percent through capture and control systems, zero-emission requirements, operations and maintenance requirements, and so-called green well completion requirements. The EPA plans to issue a supplemental proposal enhancing this proposed rulemaking in 2022 that will contain additional requirements that were not included in the November 2021 proposed rule. EPA anticipates issuing a final rule before the end of 2022.\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nAdditionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of GHG emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement, which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their greenhouse gas emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. President Biden announced in April 2021 a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50 percent to 52 percent from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. Moreover, the international community gathered again in Glasgow in November 2021 at the 26th Conference of the Parties (\"COP26\"), during which multiple announcements (not having the effect of law) were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-CO2 GHGs. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced at COP26 the launch of a Global Methane Pledge, an initiative which over 100 counties joined, committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including \"all feasible reductions\" in the energy sector. The impacts of these orders, pledges, agreements and any legislation or regulation promulgated to fulfill the United States' commitments under the Paris Agreement, COP26, or other international conventions cannot be predicted at this time.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in federal political risks in the United States. President Biden has issued several executive orders calling for more expansive action to address climate change and suspend new oil and gas operations on federal lands and waters. The suspension of the federal leasing activities prompted legal action by several states against the Biden Administration, resulting in issuance of a nationwide preliminary injunction by a federal district judge in Louisiana in June 2021, effectively halting implementation of the leasing suspension. The federal government is appealing the district court decision. Other actions adversely affecting the oil and gas industry that may be pursued by the Biden Administration include limiting hydraulic fracturing by banning new oil and gas permitting on federal lands and waters, potentially eliminating certain tax rules (referred to as subsidies) that benefit the oil and gas industry, and imposing restrictions on pipeline infrastructure. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of states, municipalities and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against oil and gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such energy companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore, are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. The Company is not currently a defendant in any of these lawsuits, but it could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact the Company's operations and could have an adverse impact on its financial condition.\nAdditionally, the Company's access to capital may be impacted by climate change policies. Shareholders and bondholders that are currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies are concerned about the potential effects of climate change and may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending and investment practices that favor \"clean\" power sources, such as wind and solar, making those sources more attractive, and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Many of the largest U.S. banks have made \"net zero\" carbon emission commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps quantify and reduce those emissions. At COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (\"GFANZ\") announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over $130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. The various suballiances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing, and/or underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050. These and other developments in the financial sector could lead to some lenders restricting access to capital for or divesting from certain industries or companies, including the oil and gas sector, or requiring that borrowers take additional steps to reduce their GHG emissions. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions may be pressured or required to adopt policies that limit funding for fossil fuel energy companies. In late 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it had joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (\"NGFS\"), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. More recently, in November 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. While the Company cannot predict what policies may result from these announcements, a material reduction in the capital available to the fossil fuel industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing activities, which could impact the Company's business and operations. Separately, the SEC has also announced that is scrutinizing existing climate-change related disclosures in public filings, increasing the potential for enforcement if the SEC were to allege an issuer's existing climate disclosures misleading or deficient.\nFinally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nevents, as well as chronic shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns. These climatic developments have the potential to cause physical damage to the Company's assets and thus could have an adverse effect on its exploration and production operations. Additionally, changing meteorological conditions, particularly temperature, may result in changes to the amount, timing, or location of demand for energy or its production. While the Company's consideration of changing climatic conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design is intended to reduce the uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce, its ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part on the effectiveness of its facilities and its disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning, which may not have considered or be prepared for every eventuality.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of these developments with respect to climate change initiatives and further restrictions on GHG emissions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of the Company's assets and production operations may impact the environment or cause environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to the Company.\nThe Company's assets and production operations may give rise to significant environmental costs and liabilities as a result of the Company's handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and water discharges related to its operations, and due to past industry operations and waste disposal practices. The Company's oil and gas business involves the generation, handling, treatment, storage, transport and disposal of wastes, hazardous substances and petroleum hydrocarbons and is subject to environmental hazards, such as oil and produced water spills, NGL and gas leaks, pipeline and vessel ruptures and unauthorized discharges of such wastes, substances and hydrocarbons, that could expose the Company to substantial liability due to pollution and other environmental damage. The Company could also incur costs and liabilities arising out of the unintended release of its flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids that the Company injects or has injected into non-producing formations. Another consequence of such contamination may be lawsuits alleging that its operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. The occurrence of any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's hydraulic fracturing and former sand mining operations may result in silica-related health issues and litigation that could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company routinely conducts hydraulic fracturing in its drilling and completion programs, which activity requires management and use of significant volumes of sand. Additionally, the Company owns and formerly operated certain sand mining operations. The inhalation of respirable crystalline silica dust is associated with the lung disease silicosis. There is evidence of an association between crystalline silica exposure or silicosis and lung cancer and a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders, such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the commercial sand industry. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing and handling sand could materially and adversely affect the Company through the threat of product liability or personal injury lawsuits, enacted OSHA silica regulations and increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. The occurrence of significant silica-related health issues as well as any pending or future claims or inadequacies of insurance coverage or contractual indemnification arising out of such issues could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\nIncreasing attention to ESG matters may impact the Company's business.\nBusinesses across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their ESG practices. Businesses that do not adapt to or comply with investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, which are continuing to evolve, or businesses that are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such business entity could be materially and adversely affected. Increasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on businesses to address climate change, and potential consumer use of substitutes to energy commodities may result in increased costs, reduced demand for the Company's hydrocarbon products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on its stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for the Company's hydrocarbon products, additional governmental investigations and private litigation, an increase in shareholder activism as shareholders may attempt to effect changes to the Company's business or governance, whether by shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise, or constraints in sources of capital as certain financial institutions, institutional investors and other sources of capital limit or eliminate their investment in oil and gas activities.\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nAs part of the Company's ongoing effort to enhance its ESG efforts, its board of directors has established a Sustainability and Climate Oversight Committee, which is charged with the ongoing oversight of the Company's corporate climate-related risk analysis, as well as its Sustainability Report, Climate Risk Report and other related activities. Additionally, in 2021, to further strengthen the Company's ESG performance, it enhanced its aspirational emissions reduction goals as follows: (i) increased its emissions reduction targets for its methane emissions intensity from a 40 percent reduction to a 75 percent reduction by 2030 and its GHG emissions intensity from a 25 percent reduction to a 50 percent reduction by 2030 and (ii) maintaining a flaring intensity standard of less than one percent of gas produced and to end routine flaring by 2030, with an aspirational goal to achieve it by 2025. While the Company may elect to establish various voluntary ESG targets now or in the future, such targets are aspirational. The Company may not be able to meet such targets in the manner or on such a timeline as initially contemplated, including as a result of unforeseen costs or technical difficulties associated with achieving such results. To the extent the Company elected to pursue such targets and were able to achieve the desired target levels, such achievement may have been accomplished as a result of entering into various contractual arrangements, including the purchase of various credits or offsets that may be deemed to mitigate its ESG impact instead of actual changes in ESG performance. Notwithstanding the Company's election to pursue aspirational targets now or in the future, it may receive pressure from investors, lenders or other groups to adopt more aggressive climate or other ESG-related goals, but the Company cannot guarantee it will be able to implement such goals because of potential costs or technical or operational obstacles.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating business entities on their approach to ESG matters. Currently, there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings, but the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Additionally, certain investors use these scores to benchmark businesses against their peers and if a business entity is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with such entities to require improved ESG disclosure or performance. Moreover, certain members of the broader investment community may consider a business entity's sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. Consequently, a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of the Company's stock from consideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of the Company's operations by certain investors. Additionally, though the Company believes it can achieve its voluntary ESG targets and goals, any failure to realize or the perception of a failure to realize voluntary targets or long-term goals, could lead to a negative perception of the Company.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe Company's operations are subject to stringent environmental, oil and gas-related and occupational safety and health legal requirements that could increase its costs of doing business and result in operating restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, drilling or completion of oil and gas wells, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local legal requirements governing, among other things, the drilling of wells (including allocation wells on two or more leaseholds that are not pooled), rates of production, the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the transportation and sale of oil, NGLs and gas, the discharging of materials into the environment, environmental protection and occupational safety and health. These requirements may take the form of laws, regulations, and executive actions, and noncompliance with these legal requirements may subject the Company to sanctions, including administration, civil or criminal penalties, remedial cleanups or corrective actions, delays in permitting or performance of projects, natural resource damages and other liabilities. Changes in administrative procedures or authorizations, court decisions, and legislative action with respect to any of these areas, including authorizations for allocation wells, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's anticipated future production, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with its operations, the Company must obtain and maintain numerous environmental and oil and gas related permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities, and may incur substantial costs in doing so. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay, curtail or cease the development of oil and gas projects. The Company may in the future be charged royalties on gas emissions or required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues. For example, in 2015, the EPA under the Obama Administration issued a final rule under the CAA, making the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (\"NAAQS\") for ground-level ozone more stringent. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and, on December 31, 2020, published a final action that, upon conducting a periodic review of the ozone standard in accord with CAA requirements, elected to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. However, several groups have filed litigation over this December 2020 decision, and the Biden Administration has announced plans to reconsider the December 2020 final action in favor of a more stringent ground-level ozone NAAQS. State implementation of the revised\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nNAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of the Company's equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase the Company's capital expenditures and operating costs.\nIn another example, there continues to be uncertainty on the federal government's applicable jurisdictional reach under the CWA over waters of the United States, including wetlands, as the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\") under the Obama, Trump and Biden Administrations have pursued multiple rulemakings since 2015 in an attempt to determine the scope of such reach. While the EPA and Corps under the Trump Administration issued a final rule in January 2021 narrowing federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, President Biden issued an executive order to further review and assess these regulations consistent with the new administration's policy objectives, following which the EPA and Corps announced plans in June 2021 to initiate a new rulemaking process that would repeal the 2020 rule and restore protections that were in place prior to the 2015. Although the EPA and Corps did not seek to vacate the 2020 rule on an interim basis, two federal district courts in Arizona and New Mexico have vacated the 2020 rule in decisions announced during the third quarter of 2021. While these district court decisions may be appealed, it is clear that the EPA and Corps intend to adopt a more expansive definition for waters of the United States. As an initial step, the agencies published on December 7, 2021 a proposed rulemaking that would put back into place the pre-2015 definition of \"waters of the United States.\" The proposed rule, if adopted would serve as an interim approach to \"waters of the United States\" and provide the agency with time to develop a subsequent rule that builds upon the currently proposed rule based, in part, on additional stakeholder involvement. To the extent that any new final rule or rules issued by the EPA and Corps under the Biden Administration expands the scope of the CWA's jurisdiction in areas where the Company conducts operations, such developments could delay, restrict or halt the development of projects, result in longer permitting timelines, or increased compliance expenditures or mitigation costs for the Company's operations, which may reduce the Company's rate of production of oil and gas and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, the Company's operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal OSHA and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of employees. Among other things, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in the Company's operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.\nCompliance with these legal requirements, or any other new environmental or occupational safety and health laws, regulations or executive actions could, among other things, require the Company to install new or modified emission or safety controls on equipment or processes, incur longer permitting timelines, and incur increased capital or operating expenditures, which costs may be significant. Additionally, one or more of these developments could impact the Company's oil and gas exploration, production and development activities, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLaws, regulations and other executive actions or regulatory initiatives regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase the Company's cost of doing business and result in additional operating restrictions, delays or cancellations that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company routinely conducts hydraulic fracturing in its drilling and completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, but the practice continues to attract considerable public, scientific and governmental attention in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation, including by federal agencies.\nAt the federal level, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority under the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance for such activities. Additionally, the EPA issued a final regulation under the CWA prohibiting discharges to publicly owned treatment works of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities. In late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \"water cycle\" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Also, in 2016, the BLM under the Obama Administration published a final rule imposing more stringent standards on hydraulic fracturing on federal lands; however, in late 2018, the BLM, under the Trump Administration, published a final rule rescinding the 2016 final rule. Since that time, litigation challenging the BLM's 2016 final rule and the 2018 final rule has resulted in rescission in federal courts of both the 2016 rule and the 2018 final rule but appeals to those decisions are ongoing.\nNotwithstanding these regulatory developments, the Biden Administration has issued executive orders, could issue additional executive orders and could pursue other legislative and regulatory initiatives that restrict hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands. For example, the Biden Administration issued an order in January 2021 suspending the issuance of\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nnew leases on federal lands and waters pending review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas leasing and permitting practices. The suspension of these federal leasing activities prompted legal action by several states against the Biden Administration, resulting in issuance of a nationwide preliminary injunction by a federal district judge in Louisiana in June 2021, effectively halting implementation of the leasing suspension. The federal government is appealing the district court decision. Separately, the DOI released its report on federal oil and gas leasing and permitting practices in November 2021,\u202ffollowing a review of\u202fthe onshore and offshore federal oil and gas program. The report states an intent to modernize the federal oil and gas leasing program and, in respect of the onshore sector, recommends adjusting royalty rates to ensure that the full value of the tracts being leased are captured and strengthening financial assurance coverage amounts that are more protective of the federal government and taxpayers. Certain of the report recommendations require action by Congress and cannot be implemented unilaterally by the new administration and, thus, the extent to which the Biden Administration will act upon the report's recommendations cannot be predicted at this time. Further constraints may be adopted by the Biden Administration in the future.\nAt the state level, many states have adopted legal requirements that have imposed new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, including in states where the Company's oil and gas exploration and production activities occur. States could also elect to place prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing and local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.\nLaws and regulations pertaining to protection of threatened and endangered species or to critical habitat, wetlands and natural resources could delay, restrict or prohibit the Company's operations and cause it to incur substantial costs that may have a material adverse effect on the Company's development and production of reserves.\nThe federal ESA and comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Under the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species' habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (\"MBTA\"). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\"), during the Trump Administration, issued a final rule on January 7, 2021, which clarifies that criminal liability under the MBTA will apply only to actions \"directed at\" migratory birds, its nests, or its eggs; however, the FWS under the Biden Administration has since published a final rule in October 2021 revoking the January 2021 rule and affirmatively stating that the MBTA prohibits incidental takes of migratory birds. Some of the Company's operations are conducted in areas where protected species or their habitats are known to exist. In these areas, the Company may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse effects to protected species and their habitats, and the Company may be delayed, restricted or prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when the Company's operations could have an adverse effect on the species. In addition, the FWS may make new determinations on the listing of species as endangered or threatened under the ESA. The dunes sagebrush lizard and the lesser prairie chicken are examples of species that, if listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA in the future, could impact the Company's operations. The designation of previously unprotected species or the re-designation of under protected species as threatened or endangered in areas where the Company conducts operations could cause the Company to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in delays, restrictions or prohibitions on its development and production activities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to develop and produce reserves.\nThe Company's transportation of gas; sales and purchases of oil, NGLs and gas or other energy commodities and any derivative activities related to such energy commodities, expose the Company to potential regulatory risks.\nThe FERC, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets relevant to the Company's business. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to the Company's transportation of gas in interstate commerce, physical sales and purchases of oil, NGL, gas or other energy commodities, and any derivative activities related to these energy commodities, the Company is required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies, which hold substantial enforcement authority. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could result in agency actions that could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with its business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") enacted in July 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as the Company, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations for its\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nimplementation. While many Dodd-Frank Act regulations are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is ongoing, and the ultimate effect of the adopted rules and regulations and any future rules and regulations on the Company's business remain uncertain.\nIn 2021, the CFTC voted to finalize a new set of rules regarding position limits for certain physical commodity derivatives (the \"Final Position Limits Rule\"). The Final Position Limits Rule establishes new and amended position limits for futures and options contracts in various commodities (including oil and gas) and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Under the Final Position Limits Rule, certain types of derivative transactions are exempt from these limits, provided that such derivative transactions satisfy the CFTC's requirements for certain enumerated \"bona fide\" derivative transactions, pass-through swaps and certain anticipatory hedges. The Final Position Limits Rule also includes new exemptions for conditional spot-month positions in gas, preexisting positions acquired in good faith and, in limited circumstances, upon request to the CFTC.\nThe CFTC has also adopted final rules regarding the aggregation requirements applicable to position limits (such rules, as expanded by the Final Positions Limits Rule, the \"Aggregation Rule\"). The Aggregation Rule requires the aggregation of positions in commodity futures contracts and the economically equivalent futures, options and swaps held by separate but related entities for purposes of determining compliance with position limits. Absent an applicable exemption, aggregation is required across accounts in which a market participant holds at least a ten percent equity interest or where multiple accounts with identical trading strategies are controlled by such aggregating entity. The CFTC has granted relief from some of the aggregation requirements in the Aggregation Rule until August 12, 2022 for aggregating entities that hold or control the trading of multiple accounts or entities with substantially identical trading strategies unless they hold or control such accounts or entities to willfully evade applicable position limits. The Final Position Limits Rule provides that, by January 21, 2022, market participants need to comply with speculative position limits applicable for commodity futures contracts, other than economically equivalent swaps. Economically equivalent swaps will become subject to position limits under the Final Position Limits Rule on January 1, 2023. These rules may affect both the size of the positions that the Company may hold and the ability or willingness of counterparties to trade with the Company, potentially increasing the costs of transactions. Moreover, such changes could materially reduce the Company's access to derivative opportunities, which could adversely affect revenues or cash flow during periods of low commodity prices. The ultimate effect of these rules and any additional regulations on the Company's business is uncertain.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require the Company, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although the Company believes it qualifies for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to mitigate its commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that the Company uses. If the Company's swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into uncleared swaps becomes prohibitive, the Company may be required to clear such transactions. The ultimate effect of these rules and any additional regulations on the Company's business is uncertain.\nIn addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although the Company expects to qualify for the end-user exception from margin requirements for swaps entered into to manage its commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that the Company uses. If any of the Company's swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, the posting of collateral could reduce its liquidity and cash available for capital expenditures and could reduce its ability to manage commodity price volatility and the volatility in its cash flows.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon the Company's business will not be known until the regulations are fully implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. In addition, it is possible that the Biden administration could expand regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and the entities that participate in that market through either the Dodd-Frank Act or the enactment of new legislation. The Dodd-Frank Act (and any regulations implemented thereunder) and any new legislation could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks the Company encounters and reduce the Company's ability to monetize or restructure its existing derivative contracts. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, in part, for the purpose of preventing the burdens associated with excessive speculation causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the price of an underlying commodity (including oil and gas). The Company's revenues could therefore be materially and adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices.\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nThe European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent the Company transacts with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulations in foreign jurisdictions, the Company may become subject to, or otherwise affected by, such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nRegulation by the CFTC and banking regulators of the over-the-counter derivatives market and market participants could cause the Company's contract counterparties, which are generally financial institutions and other market participants, to curtail or cease their derivatives activities. The Company believes that these regulatory trends have contributed to a reduction in liquidity of the over-the-counter derivatives market, which could make it more difficult to engage in derivative transactions covering significant volumes of the Company's future production, and which could materially and adversely affect the cost and availability of derivatives to the Company. If the Company reduces its use of derivatives as a result of such regulation, the Company's results of operations may become more volatile and its cash flows may be less predictable, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and its results of operations.\nThe Company's bylaws provide, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the Company and its stockholders and that the federal district courts of the United States shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of causes of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933. These provisions could increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit the ability of the Company's stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company's directors, officers or other employees.\nThe Company's bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders, (c) any action against the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (d) any action against the Company or any director, officer, other employee or agent of the Company asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, including, without limitation, any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Company's certificate of incorporation or the Company's bylaws. The Company's bylaws also provided that the federal district courts of the United States shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933. Although the Company's bylaws provide for an exclusive forum for causes of action under the Securities Act of 1933, its stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The choice of forum provisions may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company's directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or the Company's directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company's bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nRisks Associated with Acquisitions\nThe financial and operational synergies attributable to acquisitions may vary from expectations.\nPioneer may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from acquisitions, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and operating results. The success of an acquisition will depend, in significant part, on Pioneer's ability to successfully integrate the acquired business and realize the anticipated strategic benefits and synergies from the combination. Actual operating, technological, strategic and revenue synergies, if achieved at all, may be less significant than expected or may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If Pioneer is not able to achieve these objectives and realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from an acquisition within the anticipated timing or at all, Pioneer's business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nLitigation relating to acquisitions could result in substantial costs to the Company.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition, merger or other business combination agreements. Even if such a lawsuit is without merit, defending against these\nPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY\nclaims can result in substantial costs and divert the time and resources of management. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on the Company's liquidity and financial condition.\nThe Company, subsidiaries, or persons that have indemnification rights against the Company or its subsidiaries may be named in one or more lawsuits in connection with prior acquisitions. If any such lawsuits are filed, there can be no assurance that the Company and the other defendants will be successful in the outcome of any such pending or any potential future lawsuits. The defense or settlement of any of these potential lawsuits may adversely affect the Company's business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's future results will suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations.\nAs a result of acquisitions, the size and geographic footprint of the Company's business will likely increase. The Company's future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and the associated increased costs and complexity. The Company may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the increase in the size of its business. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from acquisitions.", "PERMNO": 75241, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PXD"}
