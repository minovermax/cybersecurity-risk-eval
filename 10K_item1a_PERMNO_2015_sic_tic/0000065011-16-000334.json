{"cik": "65011", "company": "MEREDITH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-08-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, investors should consider carefully the following risk factors when investing in our securities. In addition to the risks described below, there may be additional risks that we have not yet perceived or that we currently believe are immaterial.\nAdvertising represents the largest portion of our revenues and advertising demand may fluctuate from period to period. In fiscal 2016, 55 percent of our revenues were derived from advertising. Advertising constitutes 71 percent of our local media revenues and 48 percent of our national media revenues. Demand for advertising is highly dependent upon the strength of the U.S. economy. During an economic downturn, demand for advertising may decrease. The growth in alternative forms of media, particularly electronic media including those based on the internet, has increased the competition for advertising dollars, which could in turn reduce expenditures for magazine and television advertising or suppress advertising rates.\nCirculation revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues. Magazine circulation is another significant source of revenue, representing 20 percent of total revenues and 30 percent of national media revenues. Preserving the number of copies sold is critical for maintaining advertising sales. Magazines face increasing competition from alternative forms of media and entertainment. As a result, sales of magazines through subscriptions and at the newsstand could decline. As publishers compete for subscribers, subscription prices could decrease and marketing expenditures may increase.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of alternative methods for the delivery of content and have driven consumer demand and expectations in unanticipated directions. If we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences, our business, financial condition, and prospects may be adversely affected. Technology developments also pose other challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. New delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, the loss of distribution control, and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers. We may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on websites proliferates. In addition, technologies such as subscription streaming media services and mobile video are increasing competition for household audiences and advertisers. This competition may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our broadcasting and print revenues, which we believe may challenge us to expand the contribution of our digital businesses.\nOur websites and internal networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized persons accessing our systems, which could disrupt our operations. The Company uses computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our website activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, which we endeavor to protect from unauthorized access. However, it is possible that unauthorized persons may be able to circumvent our protections and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our digital operations. We invest in security resources and technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber-attack, but the techniques used to attempt attacks are constantly changing. A breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.\nEvolving privacy and information security laws and regulations may impair our ability to market to consumers. Meredith's consumer database includes first-party data that is used to market our products to our customers and is also rented to or used on behalf of marketing and advertising clients. As public awareness shifts to data gathering and usage, privacy rights, and data protection, new laws and regulations may be passed that would restrict or prevent us from utilizing this data. Such restrictions could reduce or eliminate this resource for generating revenue for the Company.\nWorld events may result in unexpected adverse operating results for our local media segment. Our local media results could be affected adversely by world events such as wars, political unrest, acts of terrorism, and natural disasters. Such events can result in significant declines in advertising revenues as the stations will not broadcast or will limit broadcasting of commercials during times of crisis. In addition, our stations may have higher newsgathering costs related to coverage of the events.\nOur local media operations are subject to FCC regulation. Our broadcasting stations operate under licenses granted by the FCC. The FCC regulates many aspects of television station operations including employment practices, political advertising, indecency and obscenity, programming, signal carriage, and various technical matters. Violations of these regulations could result in penalties and fines. Changes in these regulations could impact the results of our operations. The FCC also regulates the ownership of television stations. Changes in the ownership rules could adversely affect our ability to consummate future transactions. Details regarding regulation and its impact on our local media operations are provided in Item 1 - Business beginning on page 5.\nLoss of or changes in affiliation agreements could adversely affect operating results for our local media segment. Due to the quality of the programming provided by the networks, stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market. As a result, it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations. Most of our stations have network affiliation agreements. Seven are affiliated with CBS, five with FOX, two with MyNetworkTV, one with NBC, and one with ABC. These television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations' commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during the programming. In most cases, we also make cash payments to the networks. These payments are in essence a portion of the retransmission fees that Meredith receives from cable, satellite, and telecommunications service providers, which pay Meredith to carry our television programming in our markets. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and/or which may not be as attractive to our audiences, resulting in reduced revenues. Furthermore, the non-renewal of any retransmission consent agreement with a major cable, satellite, or telecommunications service provider could adversely affect the economics of our relationship with the applicable network(s), advertising revenues, and our local brands. If renewed, our network affiliation agreements and our retransmission agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us. Our CBS affiliation agreements expire in August 2017 and June 2020. The MyNetworkTV affiliation agreements expire in September 2018. Our Fox affiliation in Springfield, Massachusetts is extended and being negotiated to be renewed currently, all other FOX affiliation agreements expire in December 2017. Our NBC affiliation agreement expires in December 2017 and our ABC affiliation agreement expires in December 2019.\nClient relationships are important to our brand licensing and consumer relationship marketing businesses. Our ability to maintain existing client relationships and generate new clients depends significantly on the quality of our products and services, our reputation, and the continuity of Company and client personnel. Dissatisfaction with our products and services, damage to our reputation, or changes in key personnel could result in a loss of business.\nPaper and postage prices are difficult to predict and control. Paper and postage represent significant components of our total cost to produce, distribute, and market our printed products. In fiscal 2016, these expenses accounted for 18 percent of national media's operating costs. Paper is a commodity and its price can be subject to significant volatility. All of our paper supply contracts currently provide for price adjustments based on prevailing market prices; however, we historically have been able to realize favorable paper pricing through volume discounts.\nThe USPS distributes substantially all of our subscription magazines and many of our marketing materials. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the USPS and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Although we work with others in the industry and through trade organizations to encourage the USPS to implement efficiencies that will minimize rate increases, we cannot predict with certainty the magnitude of future price changes for paper and postage. Further, we may not be able to pass such increases on to our customers.\nAcquisitions pose inherent financial and other risks and challenges. As a part of our strategic plan, we have acquired businesses and we expect to continue acquiring businesses in the future. These acquisitions can involve a number of risks and challenges, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability. Such risks and challenges include underperformance relative to our expectations and the price paid for the acquisition; unanticipated demands on our management and operational resources; difficulty in integrating personnel, operations, and systems; retention of customers of the combined businesses; assumption of contingent liabilities; and acquisition-related earnings charges. If our acquisitions are not successful, we may record impairment charges. Our ability to continue to make acquisitions will depend upon our success at identifying suitable targets, which requires substantial judgment in assessing their values, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability, as well as the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices and whether restrictions are imposed by regulations. Moreover, competition for certain types of acquisitions is significant, particularly in the fields of broadcast stations and digital media. Even if successfully negotiated, closed, and integrated, certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected return on investment targets.\nFurther impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is possible, depending upon future operating results and the value of the Company's stock. Although the Company wrote down its goodwill and intangible assets in the national media segment by $155.8 million in fiscal 2016, further impairment charges are possible. We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of every fiscal year and on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist. Factors which influence the evaluation include, among many things, the Company's stock price and expected future operating results. If the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is no longer deemed to be recoverable, a potentially material impairment charge could be incurred. At June 30, 2016, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $1.8 billion, or 68 percent of Meredith's total assets, with $1.0 billion in the national media segment and $0.8 billion in the local media segment. The review of goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company has three reporting units, local media, magazine brands, and MXM. As of May 31, 2016, the date that management last performed our annual review of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, there were no qualitative factors that indicated that a quantitative impairment analysis was needed for the the local media reporting unit. The fair value of the magazine brands reporting unit exceeded its net assets by approximately 20 percent. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company determined that the MXM reporting unit was impaired. The resulting evaluation determined that the carrying value of MXM's goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value and an impairment charge of $116.9 million was recorded by the Company. Changes in key assumptions about the economy or business prospects used to estimate fair value or other changes in market conditions could result in additional impairment charges. Although these charges would be non-cash in nature and would not affect the Company's operations or cash flow, they would reduce stockholders' equity and reported results of operations in the period charged.\nWe have two classes of stock with different voting rights. We have two classes of stock: common stock and Class B stock. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share and account for 43 percent of the voting power. Holders of Class B stock are entitled to ten votes per share and account for the remaining 57 percent of the voting power. There are restrictions on who can own Class B stock. The majority of Class B shares are held by members of Meredith's founding family. Control by a limited number of holders may make the Company a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This voting control also prevents other shareholders from exercising significant influence over certain of the Company's business decisions.\nThe preceding risk factors should not be construed as a complete list of factors that\nmay affect our future operations and financial results.", "PERMNO": 42796, "SIC": 2721, "TIC": "MDP"}
