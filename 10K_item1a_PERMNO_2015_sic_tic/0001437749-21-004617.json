{"cik": "797465", "company": "HG Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the specific risk factors described below in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and a loss of all or part of your investment.\nMaterial risks of the Company\nWe have no revenue-generating operations owned directly by the Company and have limited sources of income following the Asset Sale, which may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nAs a result of the Asset Sale, we had no revenue-generating operations and no sources of income other than payments of interest and principal under the subordinated secured promissory notes from Buyer and S&L, then remaining payments to be made to us under the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, refundable alternative minimum tax credits, and repayment at death of premiums we have paid for a split dollar life insurance policy for a former executive officer. As of March 19, 2019, our sources of income also include dividends on HC Realty Common Stock and HC Realty Series B Stock. There can be no guarantee that suitable assets in addition to our investment in HC Realty will be available for us to purchase or that any assets acquired will generate the revenues anticipated or any revenue at all. A failure by us to secure additional sources of revenue could negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nWe may not receive the amount owed us under the secured promissory note from S&L.\nThe S&L Note, which had an outstanding principal amount of $3.3 million as of December 31, 2020, will mature and the entire principal amount will be payable in March 2023. During 2020, we recorded an impairment loss of $833,000 on the S&L Note as a result of concluding, based on current information and events, including the impact of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) on S&L\u2019s business and its customers, that we did not believe we would be able to collect the entire amount due under the S&L Note. S&L\u2019s ability to make payments to us under the S&L Note may continue to be adversely impacted by the current pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19 as S&L\u2019s operations may continue to be adversely impacted by disruptions to the supply chain and distribution channels for its products caused by this pandemic. Consequently, we may have to record additional impairment charges with respect to the S&L Note. There is no guarantee that S&L will pay us the amounts owed under the S&L Note or that, in the event of default by S&L, the collateral securing the S&L Note will be sufficient to pay the S&L Note in full.\nOur business may be adversely impacted as a result of the pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19.\nThe pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19 has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, economic activity nationally and globally. These economic and market conditions and other effects resulting from COVID-19 may adversely affect us. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact us is uncertain. S&L\u2019s ability to make payments to us under the S&L Note may continue to be adversely impacted by the current pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19 as S&L\u2019s operations may continue to be adversely impacted by disruptions to the supply chain and distribution channels for its products caused by this pandemic. Consequently, we may have to record additional impairment charges with respect to the S&L Note.\nWe will also monitor the impact of this pandemic on our investment in HC Realty, but we are not currently anticipating a significant impact as HC Realty holds properties that are leased entirely to the United States Government for occupancy by federal agencies. Many of these federal agencies are deemed essential and continued operations amidst the various federal, state, and local restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19. It is possible, however, that a resurgence in COVID-19 cases resulting in tighter restrictions may have the effect of heightening adverse impacts to HC Realty\u2019s operations.\nAn \u201cownership change\u201d could limit the use of our net operating loss carryforwards and our potential to derive a benefit from our net operating loss carryforwards.\nIf an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs pursuant to applicable statutory regulations, we are potentially subject to limitations on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards which in turn could adversely impact our potential to derive a benefit from our net operating loss carryforwards. While we have entered into a rights agreement designed to preserve and protect our net operating loss carryforwards, there is no guarantee that the rights agreement will prevent us from experiencing an ownership change and, therefore, having a limitation on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d would occur if there is a cumulative change in the ownership of our common stock of more than 50% by one or more \u201c5% shareholders\u201d during a three-year test period.\nFailure to successfully identify, acquire and, to the extent applicable, operate non-furniture related assets could cause our stock price to decline.\nFollowing the closing of the Asset Sale, we began evaluating alternatives for using cash proceeds from the Asset Sale to acquire non-furniture related assets. We have not acquired any assets other than the equity interest we acquired in HC Realty and we may not be able to acquire other profitable assets. In addition, any assets that we do acquire, including our equity interest in HC Realty, may not be profitable. If we are not successful in identifying, acquiring and, to the extent applicable, operating non-furniture related assets, our stock price may decline.\nWe will likely have no operating history in the business of non-furniture related assets to be acquired, and therefore, with respect to certain assets, we will be subject to the risks inherent in establishing a new line of business.\nOther than the equity interest we acquired in HC Realty, we have not acquired any additional assets or the line or lines of business to which any such assets may relate and, therefore, cannot fully describe the specific risks presented by an acquisition of such assets. It is likely that we will have had no operating history in the line of business of any such assets to be acquired, and it is possible that any such assets that we may acquire will have a limited operating history in their business. Accordingly, to the extent we acquire any such assets, our future success may in part be subject to the risks, expenses, problems and delays inherent in establishing a new line of business and the ultimate success of such new business cannot be assured. In addition, prior to March 2019, our management did not have prior experience relating to the operations of a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) such as HC Realty and the ultimate success of our investment in HC Realty cannot be assured.\nResources may be expended in researching potential acquisitions that might not be consummated.\nThe investigation of non-furniture company assets to acquire and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements and other documents will require substantial management time and attention in addition to potentially incurring legal and other professional expenses. If a decision is made not to complete a specific acquisition, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had incurred $0 and $10,000, respectively, of such related expenses. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific acquisition, we may fail to consummate the acquisition for any number of reasons including those beyond our control.\nWe may be required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nUnder Section 3(a)(l) of the 1940 Act, an issuer is deemed to be an investment company if it is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire \u201cinvestment securities\u201d having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. The 1940 Act defines \u201cinvestment securities\u201d broadly to include virtually all securities except U.S. government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves regulated or exempt investment companies. Consequently, the A&R Note (while it was outstanding) and S&L Note, as well as the securities of HC Realty we hold, may be considered investment securities and we may fall within the scope of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act.\nA company that falls within the scope of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act can avoid being regulated as an investment company if it can rely on certain of the exclusions or exemptions under the 1940 Act. One such exclusion is Rule 3a-2 under the 1940 Act, which temporarily relieves certain issuers that are in transition to a non-investment company business from regulation under the1940 Act (a \u201ctransient investment company\u201d). The rule provides a one-year safe harbor for a company to comply with another exemption or exclusion under the 1940 Act provided that the company has a bona fide intent to be primarily engaged in a business other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities. The one-year grace period started on the date of the Asset Sale, which was March 2, 2018, and ended on March 2, 2019. We did not acquire sufficient assets within one year from closing the Asset Sale as contemplated by Rule 3a-2. There is no assurance that we will not be deemed subject to the 1940 Act and be required to register as an investment company.\nWhile in transient investment company status, we actively pursued alternatives for using cash proceeds from the Asset Sale for the acquisition of non-furniture related assets and acquired an equity interest in HC Realty on March 19, 2019. On April 3, 2020, we used $1.0 million of our cash to purchase an additional 100,000 shares of HC Realty Series B Stock. On April 29, 2020, we used an additional $2.5 million of our cash to purchase an additional 250,000 shares of HC Realty Series B Stock. On June 29, 2020, we used $4.75 million of the cash proceeds from the Rights Offering to purchase an additional 475,000 shares of HG Realty Series B Stock. As a result of these purchases, we now own approximately 37.0% of the as-converted equity interest in HC Realty. We believe that these additional purchases allow us to rely on the exemption from investment company registration set forth in Rule 3a-1 of the 1940 Act because we own (i) at least 25% of the HC Realty Common Stock on an as-converted basis, resulting in us being presumed to control HC Realty within the meaning of Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act and (ii) a sufficient number of shares of HC Realty Series B Stock so that we primarily control HC Realty within the meaning of Rule 3(a)-1 of the 1940 Act.\nThe Company has not sought or obtained an exemptive order, no-action letter or any other assurances from the SEC or its staff regarding the Company\u2019s ability to rely on Rule 3a-2 or Rule 3a-1 of the 1940 Act, nor has the SEC or its staff provided any such order, no-action letter or other assurances. If we are required to register under the 1940 Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would significantly increase our operating expenses. Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive and potentially adverse regulation relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends and transactions with affiliates.\nOther risks specific to our investment in HC Realty\nOur investment in HC Realty may lose value.\nIn connection with using cash proceeds from the Asset Sale to acquire non-furniture related assets, we acquired an equity interest in HC Realty on March 19, 2019 by purchasing HC Common Stock and HC Series B Stock. We acquired additional HC Series B Stock on April 3, April 29, and June 29, 2020. As a result of these stock purchases, we currently own 36.4% of the as-converted equity interest of HC Realty. There is no guarantee that HC Realty will be successful implementing its business strategy for the acquisition, management and disposition of GSA properties and as a result our HC Common Stock and HC Series B Stock may lose value.\nThe value of our equity investment in HC Realty would be adversely affected if HC Realty failed to qualify as a REIT.\nHC Realty has elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Its continued qualification as a REIT depends on its satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution and stockholder ownership requirements on a continuing basis. Its ability to satisfy some of the asset tests depends upon the fair market values of its assets, some of which are not able to be precisely determined and for which HC Realty has indicated it will not obtain independent appraisals. If HC Realty fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and certain statutory relief provisions are not available, HC Realty would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and distributions to stockholders would not be deductible by it in computing its taxable income. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution. Unless entitled to relief under certain Internal Revenue Code provisions, HC Realty also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which HC Realty ceased to qualify as a REIT. In addition, if HC Realty fails to qualify as a REIT, HC Realty will no longer be required to make distributions. As a result of all these factors, HC Realty\u2019s failure to qualify as a REIT could impair its ability to expand business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our HC Common Stock and HC Series B Stock.\nRisks related to our common stock\nOur common stock is listed on the OTCQB and there may be limited ability to trade our common stock.\nTrading of our common stock is currently conducted in the over-the-counter market on the OTCQB, which is generally a less active, and therefore a less liquid, trading market than other types of markets such as stock exchanges. As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock than if our stock was traded on other markets.\nOur common stock may be deemed a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, unless the price of our shares of common stock is at least $5.00. We expect that our share price will remain less than $5.00. Unless our common stock is otherwise excluded from the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d, the penny stock rules apply. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker dealer and its sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. So long as our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, the level of trading activity could be limited and it may be difficult for investors to sell our common stock.\nRisks related to our management\nOur executive officers and some of our current and former directors may have potential or actual conflicts of interest because of their positions with HCPM and HC Realty\nSteven A. Hale II, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is sole manager of HPCM which serves as the investment adviser for the Hale Funds and two current holders of HC Realty Series B Stock. The Hale Funds own approximately 33.8% of our outstanding common stock. We also own HC Realty Series B Stock and HC Realty Common Stock. Mr. Hale also serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and a director of HC Realty. Bradley G Garner, our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, also serves as a director of HC Realty and is chief compliance officer for HPCM. Matthew A. Hultquist, one of our former directors, also serves as a director of HC Realty and is a part time employee of HC Realty serving as Senior Vice President - Acquisitions.\nMr. Hale and Mr. Garner owe fiduciary duties to us, as well as to HC Realty as a result of their positions with HC Realty and to the Hale Funds and two current holders of HC Realty Series B Stock as a result of their positions with HPCM, the investment adviser to these parties. Mr. Hultquist used to owe fiduciary duties to us and currently owes such duties to HC Realty. As a result, these executive officers and current and former directors may have potential or actual conflicts of interest when faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and HC Realty. In addition, Mr. Hale and Mr. Garner may have potential or actual conflicts of interest when faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and the Hale Funds or the two holders of HC Realty Series B Stock advised by HPCM. For example, these potential conflicts could arise over matters such as funding and capital matters.\nOur executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders have significant voting power and may vote their shares in a manner that is not in the best interest of other stockholders.\nOur current executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders control approximately 75.8% of the voting power represented by our outstanding common stock. If these stockholders act together, they may be able to exert significant control over our management and affairs requiring stockholder approval, such as the election of directors or the dissolution of the company. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of all our stockholders.\nOur management, who will be employed on a part-time basis for the foreseeable future, currently has outside business interests that will require their time and attention and may interfere with their ability to devote all of their time to our business, which may adversely affect our business and operations.\nSince our business will be limited until we find suitable non-furniture assets for acquisition, our only employees consist of our two executive officers, who will be employed for the foreseeable future on a part-time basis and who have outside business interests that could require substantial time and attention. Our executive officers are associated with Hale Partnership Capital Management LLC and devote significant time to its affairs. Our executive officers are also associated with HC Realty. On March 19, 2019, we acquired an equity interest in HC Realty and made a loan to HC Realty\u2019s operating partnership. We cannot accurately predict the amount of time and attention that will be required of our officers to perform their ongoing duties related to outside business interests. The inability of our officers to devote sufficient time to managing our business could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.", "PERMNO": 78068, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "STLY"}
