{"cik": "867374", "company": "ELECTRONICS FOR IMAGING INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nIf we fail to continue to introduce new products that achieve market acceptance on a timely basis, we will not be able to compete effectively and we will be unable to increase or maintain net revenue and gross margins.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and quickly changing environment. Our future success depends in large part upon our ability to identify demand trends and quickly develop or acquire, and manufacture and sell, products that satisfy these demands in a cost-effective manner. In order to differentiate our products from our competitors\u2019 products, we must continue to increase our focus and capital investment in research and development. For\nexample, we have committed substantial resources expressed in both man-hours and financial investment to the development of our Nozomi single-pass industrial digital inkjet platform, which was launched in the third quarter of 2017, for the corrugated, paper packaging, display printing, and other related markets. We have invested significantly in the research and development, sales and marketing, and manufacturing processes required to successfully launch this product. While we have sold a limited number of printers, we are unable to predict the actual level of demand for this product because Nozomi is a new product. If this product is not successful in the market, then our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be materially impacted.\nSuccessfully predicting demand trends is difficult, and it is very difficult to predict the effect introducing a new product will have on existing product sales. We will also need to respond effectively to new product announcements by our competitors and quickly introduce competitive products. Any delays in product development and introduction, or product introductions that do not meet broad market acceptance, or unsuccessful launches of new product lines, could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity and damage to our reputation and brands;\n\u2022\na decline in the average selling price of our products;\n\u2022\nadverse reactions in our sales channels, such as reduced online product visibility, or loss of a sales channel;\n\u2022\nproduct returns; or\n\u2022\nfailure to recover amounts invested.\nThe market for our super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet printers is extremely competitive.\nOur super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet products compete against several companies that market industrial digital inkjet printing systems based on electrostatic, drop-on-demand, and continuous drop-on-demand inkjet, and other technologies and printers utilizing UV curable ink including Agfa, Durst, Canon, HP, Inca, Mimaki, Roland, and Mutoh. Certain competitors have greater resources to develop new products and technologies and market those products, as well as acquire or develop critical components at lower costs, which would provide them with a competitive advantage. They could also exert downward pressure on product pricing to gain market share.\nReggiani industrial digital inkjet textile printers address the full scope of advanced textile printing with versatile printers suitable for water-based dispersed, acid, pigment, and reactive dye printing ink. Our Reggiani textile printers compete with printers offered by Dover, Durst, Mimaki, Roland, Epson, Konica Minolta, Robustelli, Atexco, Shenzhen Homer Textile, Kornit, and Digital Graphics. Competitive digital inkjet textile printers are manufactured in Italy, Japan, China, and smaller emerging markets such as Indonesia. Reggiani also competes with other digital inkjet textile printing technologies including pre-washing and post-washing printing techniques.\nThe local competitors in the Chinese and Korean markets are developing, manufacturing, and selling inexpensive printers mainly to the local markets. Our ability to compete depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including the price, performance, and acceptance of our current printers and any products we develop in the future.\nWe also face competition from existing conventional and digital inkjet super-wide and wide format printing methods, including screen printing and offset printing. Our competitors could develop new products, with existing or new technology, that could be more competitive in our market than our printers.\nThe market for our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers is very competitive.\nOur Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printer competes with ceramic tile decoration printers manufactured in Spain, Austria, Italy, Brazil, China, and smaller emerging competitors in other markets such as\nIndonesia. The ceramic tile industry has experienced relocation from southern Europe to the emerging markets of China, India, Brazil, and Indonesia. Competition in the Chinese market consists of small Chinese ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers and European manufacturers that are reducing prices to gain market share. In addition to our facility in Spain, we operate a Cretaprint sales and support center in Foshan, Guangdong, China, which is home to the largest concentration of ceramic tile manufacturers in China.\nOur ceramic tile decoration imaging competitors are a mix of large, medium, and small ceramic tile decoration printer manufacturers, which are primarily privately-owned. Our competitors could develop new products, with existing or new technology, that could be more competitive in our market than our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers.\nWe face strong competition for printing supplies such as ink.\nWe compete with independent manufacturers in the ink market consisting of smaller vendors, as well as larger vendors such as DuPont Digital Printing.\nOur UV curable ink is sold to users of our super-wide and wide format UV industrial inkjet printers, which have advanced quality control systems to ensure that correct color and non-expired ink is used to prevent damage to the printer. This results in most ink used in our super-wide and wide format printers being sold by us. While third party ink is available, its use compromises the printer\u2019s quality control system and voids most provisions of our printer warranty and service contracts. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee we will be able to remain the principal ink supplier for our super-wide and wide format UV industrial digital inkjet printers. We could experience an overall price reduction within the ink market, which would also adversely affect our gross profit.\nWe sell third party branded textile ink to users of our textile digital inkjet printer. We offer a strong value proposition with our third party branded ink, but cannot guarantee that we will be the primary supplier of textile digital ink to the users of our printers as these branded ink are available on the market.\nOur solvent-based ceramic digital ink is sold to users of our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers. The ceramic ink market is generally an open system for ink and therefore customers may change between suppliers. Although we are focused on developing this recurring revenue stream, we cannot guarantee that we will become the primary supplier of ceramic digital ink to the users of our printers.\nIf the market for digital textile printing does not develop as we anticipate, we may not be able to grow our digital inkjet textile printing business.\nIf the global printed textile industry does not broadly accept digital printing as an alternative to either analog printing or single color (dyed) garments, our revenue may not grow as quickly as expected. Widespread adoption of digital textile printing depends on the willingness and ability of businesses in the printed textile industry to replace their existing analog printing systems and single color (dyed) garments with digital printing systems. The adoption of digital textile printing is dependent to some extent on the growth of \u201cfast fashion.\u201d\nA key element of our digital inkjet textile printing growth strategy is to market digital inkjet printing systems to contract printers that serve major textile brand owners and fashion designers. If leading textile brand owners and fashion designers are not convinced of the benefits of digital inkjet textile printing or if there is a significant reduction in the popularity of printed textiles, especially those that are customized or personalized, among the consumers to whom such brand owners and fashion designers cater, or if these businesses decide that digital inkjet printing processes are less reliable, less cost-effective, lower quality, or otherwise less suitable for their commercial needs than analog printing processes and single color (dyed) garments, then the market for digital textile printers and software may not develop as we anticipate and we may not be able to grow our inkjet textile printing business.\nWe face strong competition in our Productivity Software operating segment.\nOur Productivity Software operating segment, which includes our business process automation, cloud-based order entry and order management, cross media marketing, and imposition solution systems faces competition from software application vendors that specifically target the printing industry. These vendors are typically small and privately-owned companies. We also face competition from larger vendors that currently offer, or are seeking to develop, business process automation printing products including HP, Epicor, and SAP. We face competition from Oracle, SAP, SolarSoft, and Heidelberg in the packaging software market. Our Optitex 3D CAD software competes with Lectra, Assyst, CLO, Browzwear, and Gerber. There can be no assurance that we will continue to advance our technology and products or compete effectively against other companies\u2019 product offerings.\nWe do not typically have long-term purchase commitments with the printer manufacturer customers that purchase our Fiery DFE and software solutions. They have in the past reduced or ceased, and could at any time in the future reduce or cease, to purchase products from us, thereby harming our operating results and business.\nAlthough end customer and reseller channel preference for Fiery DFE and software solutions drives demand, most Fiery revenue relies on printer manufacturers to integrate Fiery technology into the design and development of their print engines. We have established direct relationships with several leading printer manufacturers and work closely with them to design, develop, and integrate Fiery DFE and software technology to maximize the capability of their print engines. These manufacturers act as distributors and sell Fiery products to end customers through reseller channels. A significant portion of our revenue is, and has been, generated by sales of our Fiery DFE and software solutions to a relatively small number of leading printer manufacturers. Our reliance on revenue from the leading printer manufacturers was 26%, 28%, and 33% of our consolidated revenue, during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Because sales of our Fiery products constitute a significant portion of our revenue and there are a limited number of printer manufacturers producing printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us, we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of printer manufacturers for a significant portion of our Fiery revenue in future periods. Accordingly, if we lose or experience reduced sales to one of these printer manufacturer customers, we will have difficulty replacing that revenue with sales to new or existing customers.\nWith the exception of certain minimum purchase obligations, we typically do not have long-term volume purchase contracts with our significant printer manufacturer customers, including Konica Minolta, Ricoh, and Canon, and they are not obligated to purchase products from us. Accordingly, our printer manufacturer customers could at any time reduce their purchases from us or cease purchasing our products altogether. For example, in 2017, two of our significant printer manufactures purchased less inventory from us and this reduction may occur in 2018 and future years, which could impact revenue from our Fiery segment. In the past, these printer manufacturer customers have elected to develop products on their own for sale to end customers, incorporated technologies developed by other companies into their products, and have directly sold third party competitive products, rather than rely solely or partially on our products. We expect that these printer manufacturer customers will continue to make such elections in the future, although our acquisition of the FFPS business partially mitigates this risk with respect to one of these leading printer manufacturer / distributors.\nMany of the products and technologies we are developing require that we coordinate development, quality testing, marketing, and other tasks with these printer manufacturers. We cannot control their development efforts or the timing of these efforts. We rely on these printer manufacturers to develop new printer and copier solutions, applications, and product enhancements that utilize our Fiery DFE technologies and software solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our success in the DFE industry depends on the ability of these printer manufacturers to utilize our technologies to develop the right solutions with the right features to meet ever changing customer requirements and responding to emerging industry standards and other technological changes.\nBecause our printer manufacturer customers incorporate our products into products they manufacture and sell, any decline in demand for copiers or laser printers or any other negative developments affecting our major customers or the computer industry in general, including reduced end user demand, would likely harm our results of operations. Certain printer manufacturer customers have experienced serious financial difficulties in the past, which led to a decline in sales of our products. If any significant customers face such difficulties in the future, our operating results could be harmed through, among other things, decreased sales volume, write-off of accounts receivable, and write-off of inventories related to products we have manufactured for these customers\u2019 products.\nEconomic uncertainty has negatively affected our business in the past and may negatively affect our business in the future.\nOur revenue and profitability depend significantly on the overall demand for information technology products that enable printing of digital data, which in turn depends on a variety of macro- and micro-economic conditions. In addition, revenue growth and profitability in our Industrial Inkjet operating segment depends on demand and spending for advertising and marketing products and programs, which also depends on a variety of macro-and micro-economic conditions.\nUncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as our customers may delay purchases of our products in response to tighter credit, negative financial news, and/or declines in income or asset values. Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or terminate their activities have resulted in a tightening in the credit market, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from a credit crisis on our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer and distributor insolvencies; increased difficulty in managing inventories; and other financial institutions negatively impacting our treasury operations.\nAlthough economic uncertainty has recently abated in Europe, uncertainty remains in the \u201csouthern European\u201d countries (primarily Italy, Spain, and Portugal) due to uncertainty in Spain related to Brexit and Catalonia and uncertainty in Italy related to significant public debt and uncollectible loans in the banking system. We have no European sovereign debt investments. Our European debt investments consist of non-sovereign corporate debt securities of $6.6 million, which represents 8% of our corporate debt instruments (4% of our short-term investments) at December 31, 2017. European debt investments are with corporations domiciled in the northern and central European countries of Netherlands, Sweden, and France. We do not have any short-term investments with corporations domiciled in the higher risk \u201csouthern European\u201d countries (i.e., Italy, Spain, and Portugal). We believe that we do not have significant exposure with respect to our money market and corporate debt investments in Europe, although we do have some exposure due to the interdependencies among the European Union countries.\nSince Europe is composed of varied countries and regional economies, our European risk profile is somewhat more diversified due to the varying economic conditions among the countries. Approximately 32% of our receivables are with European customers as of December 31, 2017. Of this amount, 30% of our European receivables (10% of consolidated gross receivables) are in the higher risk southern European countries (mostly Italy, Spain, and Portugal) and Ireland, which are adequately reserved.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economies, political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies, and shifting regulatory schemes.\nA significant amount of our revenue is generated from operations outside the U.S. Approximately $505.3 (51%), $491.7 (50%), and $408.9 (46%) million of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, shipped to locations outside the Americas, primarily to Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d)\nand APAC. We expect that sales outside of the U.S. will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue. We maintain significant operations and acquire or manufacture many of our products and/or their components outside the U.S. Our future revenue, costs, and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in each country\u2019s economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization, and other related legal matters. If our future revenue, costs, and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Specifically, the deceleration of the economy in China has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our results of operations. The Chinese government continues to rebalance the country\u2019s economic model with tightening real estate and environmental regulation.\nWe face risks from currency fluctuations.\nGiven the significance of non-U.S. sales to our total revenue, we face a continuing risk from the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Although the majority of our receivables are invoiced and collected in U.S. dollars, we have exposure from non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales (consisting of the Euro, British pound sterling, Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, Israeli shekel, and Australian dollar). We have a substantial number of international employees, resulting in material operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We have exposure from non-U.S. dollar-denominated operating expenses in foreign countries (primarily the Euro, British pound sterling, Chinese renminbi, Israeli shekel, Indian rupee, Brazilian real, and Australian dollar).\nWe can benefit from or be adversely affected by either a weaker or stronger U.S. dollar relative to major currencies worldwide with respect to our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, we can benefit from a stronger U.S. dollar due to the corresponding reduction in our foreign operating expenses translated into U.S. dollars and at the same time we can be adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar due to the corresponding reduction in foreign revenue translated into U.S. dollars. We hedge our operating expense exposure in Indian rupees. The notional amount of our Indian rupee cash flow hedge was $3.9 million at December 31, 2017.\nForward contracts not designated as hedging instruments consist of hedges of British pounds sterling, Brazilian real, Israeli shekel, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, and Euro-denominated intercompany balances with notional amounts of $144.5 million; Brazilian real, British pounds sterling, Australian dollar, Israeli shekel, and Euro-denominated trade receivables with notional amounts of $44.4 million; and hedges of British pounds sterling, Indian rupee, Israeli shekel, and Euro-denominated other net monetary assets with notional amounts of $46.6 million at December 31, 2017. These forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment since there is a natural offset for the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated asset or liability.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had not entered into hedges against any other currency exposures, but we may consider hedging against movements in other currencies in the future. Our efforts to reduce risk from our international operations and from fluctuations in foreign currencies or interest rates may not be successful, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe face risks from our international operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks because of our international operations as follows:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to access cash generated by international operations, especially in China and Brazil, due to restrictions on the repatriation of dividends, distribution of cash to shareholders outside such countries, foreign exchange control, and other restrictions;\n\u2022\nsecurity concerns, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity;\n\u2022\ncustomer credit risk, especially in emerging or economically challenged regions, with accompanying challenges to enforce our legal rights should collection issues arise;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulation, including labor regulations, and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals, permits, or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue, business, and operations;\n\u2022\nviolations of governmental regulation, including labor regulations, could result in fines and penalties, including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries, and could materially adversely affect our business;\n\u2022\ninternational labor regulations may be substantially different than the regulations we are accustomed to in the U.S., which may negatively impact labor efficiency and workforce relations;\n\u2022\ntrade legislation in either the U.S. or other countries, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance laws, or other trade policies, could adversely affect our ability to sell or manufacture in international markets;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries, and\n\u2022\nsome of our sales to international customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce (\u201cDOC\u201d) and certain transactions require prior approval of the DOC or other governmental agencies.\nWe incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the U.S. In many foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, and agents, as well as outsourced business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that employees, contractors, and agents of acquired companies did not take actions in violation of such laws and regulations prior to the date they were acquired by us, although we perform due diligence procedures to endeavor to discover any such actions prior to the acquisition date.\nWe license software used in most of our Fiery products and certain Productivity Software products from Adobe and the loss of these licenses would prevent shipment of these products.\nWe are required to obtain separate licenses from Adobe for the right to use Adobe PostScript\u00ae software in each copier or printer model that uses a Fiery DFE, and other Adobe software for certain Productivity Software products. Although to date we have successfully obtained licenses to use Adobe PostScript \u00ae and other Adobe software when required, Adobe is not required to, and we cannot be certain that Adobe will, grant future licenses to Adobe PostScript\u00ae and other Adobe software on reasonable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. To obtain licenses from Adobe, Adobe requires that we obtain quality assurance approvals from them for our products that use Adobe software. Although to date we have successfully obtained such quality assurance approvals from Adobe, we cannot be certain they will grant us such approvals in the future. If Adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals, if the Adobe licenses are terminated, or if our relationship is otherwise materially impaired, we would likely be unable to sell products that incorporate Adobe PostScript \u00ae or other Adobe software and our financial condition and results of operations would be significantly harmed.\nWe manufacture super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet printers and formulate UV curable, LED curable, and reactive dye ink in single locations. Any significant interruption in the manufacturing process at these facilities could adversely affect our business.\nOur VUTEk super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet printers are primarily manufactured in a single location in our Meredith, New Hampshire facility. In 2016, we transferred VUTEk roll-to-roll printer production to our Rosh Ha\u2019Ayin, Israel, facility, our FabriVu textile digital inkjet printer production to our Bergamo, Italy, facility, and certain wide format industrial digital inkjet printers to our Castellon, Spain, facility.\nOur VUTEk roll-to-roll super-wide format industrial digital inkjet printers are manufactured in a single location in our Rosh Ha\u2019Ayin, Israel facility. Our Reggiani industrial digital inkjet textile printers are manufactured in a single location in our Bergamo, Italy facility. Our Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration and Nozomi corrugated packaging digital inkjet printers are manufactured in a single location in our Castellon, Spain facility. We formulate our UV curable and LED curable digital ink that is used in our display graphics super-wide and wide-format industrial digital inkjet printers in a single location in our Ypsilanti, Michigan facility. We formulate our reactive dye ink that is used in our textile digital inkjet printers in a single location in our Bedford, U.K., facility. Any significant interruption in the manufacturing process at any of these facilities could affect the supply of our products, our ability to meet customer demand, and our ability to maintain market share.\nWe are developing contingency plans utilizing our manufacturing facilities in multiple locations and the capabilities of certain contract manufacturers in the event of a significant interruption in the manufacturing process at any of the aforementioned facilities. Until those plans are complete, disruptions in the manufacturing process at any of our sole source internal facilities could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products. The loss of any of these suppliers, the inability of any of these suppliers to meet our requirements, or delays or shortages of supply of these components, could adversely affect our business.\nCertain components necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. These include CPUs, chip sets, ASICs, and other related semiconductor components; inkjet print heads for our super-wide and wide format, corrugated packaging, textile, and ceramic tile decoration industrial digital inkjet printers; branded textile ink; and certain key ingredients (primarily pigments and photoinitiators) for our digital UV curable ink. We generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our component suppliers and conduct business with such suppliers largely on a purchase order basis. If we are unable to continue to procure these sole or limited sourced components from our current suppliers in the required quantities, we will have to qualify other sources, if possible, or redesign our products. If we were unable to obtain the branded textile ink or the pigments required for our digital UV curable ink, we would have to qualify other sources, if possible, or reformulate and test the new ink formulations. These suppliers may be concentrated within similar industries or geographic locations, which could potentially exacerbate these risks. We cannot provide assurance that other sources of these components exist or will be willing to supply us on reasonable terms or at all, or that we will be able to design around these components. Any unavailability, delays, or shortages of these components or any inability of our suppliers to meet our requirements, could harm our business.\nBecause the purchase of certain key components involves long lead times, in the event of unanticipated volatility in demand for our products, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet demand. Further, as has occurred in the past, in the event that anticipated demand does not materialize, we may hold excess quantities of inventory that could become obsolete. To meet projected demand, we maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent on sole or limited source suppliers and components with prices that fluctuate significantly. As a result, we are subject to risk of inventory obsolescence, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nMarket prices and availability of certain components, particularly memory subsystems and Intel-designed components, which collectively represent a substantial portion of the total manufactured cost of our products,\nhave fluctuated significantly in the past. Such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including reduced gross profit.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of subcontractors, with whom we generally do not have long-term contracts, to manufacture and deliver products to our customers. The loss of any of these subcontractors could adversely affect our business.\nWe subcontract with other companies to manufacture certain of our products and we generally do not have long-term agreements with these subcontractors. While we closely monitor our subcontractors\u2019 performance, we cannot be assured that such subcontractors will continue to manufacture our products in a timely and effective manner. In the past, a weakened economy led to the dissolution, bankruptcy, or consolidation of some of our subcontractors, which decreased the available number of subcontractors. If the available number of subcontractors were to decrease in the future, it is possible that we would not be able to secure appropriate subcontractors to fulfill our demand in a timely manner, or at all, particularly if demand for our products increases.\nThe existence of fewer subcontractors may reduce our negotiating leverage, thereby potentially resulting in higher product costs. Financial problems resulting in the inability of our subcontractors to make or ship our products, could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we change subcontractors, we could experience delays in finding, qualifying, and commencing business with new subcontractors, which would result in delayed delivery of our products and potentially the cancellation of orders for our products.\nWe have outsourced our Fiery production with Avnet, FFPS production with Dell, FFPS sustaining engineering with HCL, ceramic ink formulation with subcontractors in China and Italy, and formulation of certain textile ink with third party branded suppliers. Certain Industrial Inkjet sub-assemblies are manufactured by subcontractors. Should our subcontractors experience any inability, or unwillingness, to manufacture or deliver our products, then our business, financial condition, and operations could be harmed. Since we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our subcontractors, any of our subcontractors could enter into agreements with our competitors that might restrict or prohibit them from manufacturing our products or could otherwise lead to an inability to fill our orders in a timely manner. In such event, we may not be able to find suitable replacement subcontractors, in which case our financial condition and operations would likely be harmed.\nWe may face increased risk of inventory obsolescence, excess, or shortages related to our Industrial Inkjet printers and ink.\nWe procure raw materials and internally manufacture our super-wide and wide format, textile, and ceramic tile decoration industrial digital inkjet printers and formulate digital UV curable and reactive dye ink based on our sales forecasts. If we do not accurately forecast demand for our products, we may produce or purchase excess inventory, which may result in our inventory becoming obsolete. We might not produce the correct mix of products to match actual demand if our sales forecast is not accurate, resulting in lost sales. If we have excess printers, ink, or other products, we may need to lower prices to stimulate demand.\nOur ink products have a defined shelf life. If we do not sell the ink before the end of its shelf life, it will have to be written off. We have also experienced UV curable ink shortages in the past and may continue to experience such shortages in the future. UV curable ink shortages may require that we incur additional costs to respond to increased demand and overcome such shortages.\nIf we are not able to hire and retain skilled employees, we may not be able to develop and manufacture products, or meet demand for our products, in a timely fashion.\nWe depend on skilled employees, such as software and hardware engineers, quality assurance engineers, chemists, chemical engineers, and other technical professionals with specialized skills. We are headquartered in\nthe Silicon Valley and have research and development employees in facilities in 15 U.S. locations. We also have research and development employees in facilities in India, Europe, Israel, the U.K., Brazil, and Canada. Competition has historically been intense among companies hiring engineering and technical professionals. In times of professional labor imbalances, it has in the past and is likely in the future, to be difficult to locate and hire qualified engineers and technical professionals and to retain these employees. There are many technology companies located near our corporate offices in the Silicon Valley and our operations in India that may attempt to hire our employees.\nOur VUTEk printers are manufactured at our Meredith, New Hampshire facility, which is not located in a major metropolitan area. We have encountered difficulties in hiring and retaining adequately skilled labor and management at this location. We have entered into a six-year lease with BTMU whereby a 225,000 square foot manufacturing and warehouse facility is under construction in Manchester, New Hampshire, related to our super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet printer business in the Industrial Inkjet operating segment, which is scheduled to be completed in the first half of 2018.\nThe movement of our stock price may also impact our ability to hire and retain employees. If we do not offer competitive compensation, we may not be able to recruit or retain employees, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to develop products in a timely fashion, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe rely on our distribution channels to ensure sales growth.\nThe leading printer manufacturers, which comprise the majority of the customer base in our Fiery operating segment, are typically large profitable customers with little credit risk to us. Our Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet operating segments sell primarily through a direct sales force, augmented by some select distributors, to a broader base of customers than Fiery. Any interruption of these distribution channels could negatively impact us in the future.\nGrowing market share in the Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet operating segments increases the possibility that we will experience increased bad debt expense and increased accounts receivable.\nMany of the Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet customers are smaller and potentially less creditworthy. Our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet customer base is primarily located in geographic regions, which have recently been subject to economic challenges including southern Europe (primarily Spain and Italy) and emerging markets in APAC. Furthermore, if we increase the percentage of Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet products that are sold internationally, it may be challenging to enforce our legal rights should collection issues arise. Due to these and other factors, growing Industrial Inkjet and Productivity Software market share may cause us to experience an increase in bad debt expense and an increase in days sales outstanding (\u201cDSOs\u201d).\nDSOs increased during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased Industrial Inkjet and Productivity Software revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue, sales with extended payment terms, and a non-linear sales cycle resulting in significant billings at the end of the quarter. Industrial Inkjet and Productivity Software were 73% of consolidated revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 72% and 66% of consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We calculate DSO by dividing net accounts receivable at the end of the quarter by revenue recognized during the quarter, multiplied by the total days in the quarter, which is a measure of the relationship between sales and accounts receivable.\nAcquisitions may result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and result in difficulties assimilating and integrating operations, personnel, technologies, products, and information systems of acquired businesses.\nWe seek to develop new technologies and products from both internal and external sources. We have also purchased companies and businesses for the primary purpose of acquiring their customer base. As part of this effort, we have in the past made, and will likely continue to make, acquisitions of other businesses.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating operations, employees, technologies, products, information systems, and the required focus of management attention, time, and effort to accomplish successful integration;\n\u2022\ninformation systems may be inadequate to operate the business of the acquired company until we are able to integrate the acquired business into our information technology system;\n\u2022\nintegration of acquired business into our information system may be delayed, which may limit our ability to manage the acquired business and implement financial and operational controls;\n\u2022\ninformation systems may be poorly maintained by the acquired business;\n\u2022\nrisk of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience, or entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\npossible write-downs of impaired assets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the fair value of contingent consideration;\n\u2022\npossible restructuring of personnel or leased facilities;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\npossible overruns (compared to expectations) relative to the expense levels and cash outflows of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nadverse reactions by customers, suppliers, or parties transacting business with the acquired company or us;\n\u2022\nrisk of negatively impacting stock analyst ratings;\n\u2022\npotential litigation or any administrative proceedings arising from prior transactions or prior actions of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ninability to protect or secure technology rights;\n\u2022\npossible overruns of direct acquisition and integration costs; and\n\u2022\nequity securities issued in connection with acquisitions may be dilutive to our existing stockholders unless mitigating actions are taken such as treasury stock purchases; alternatively, acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash will reduce cash reserves.\nMergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky. We cannot provide assurance that previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not harm our business, operating results, financial condition, or stock price.\nWe face risks relating to the potential impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets.\nWe complete a review of the carrying value of our goodwill and long-lived assets annually and, based on a combination of factors (i.e., triggering events), we may be required to perform an interim analysis.\nGiven the uncertainty of the economic environment and its potential impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of any economic downturn, or the period or\nstrength of any subsequent recovery, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing at December 31, 2017 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross profit rates are not achieved, we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units, whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2018 or prior to that, if an interim triggering event were to occur. It is not possible to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material. No foreshadowing events have occurred as of December 31, 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, management approved a plan to sell approximately 31.5 acres of land and two related manufacturing buildings located in Meredith, New Hampshire (\u201cMeredith facility\u201d). The fair value of the Meredith facility, based on expected sales proceeds less cost to sell, is estimated to be less than the carrying amount of the assets. As a result, we incurred an impairment loss of approximately $0.9 million in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. We may be required to record additional impairment charges if the sales proceeds for the Meredith facility do not meet our expectations. We may also need to record impairment charges if we decide to sell or dispose of other long-term assets.\nWe are currently subject to securities lawsuits and we may be subject to similar or other litigation in the future, which may divert management\u2019s attention and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe market price of our common stock declined significantly following our August 3, 2017 announcement concerning our assessment of the timing of recognition of revenue and the effectiveness of our current and historical disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. On August 10, 2017, a purported class action lawsuit was filed alleging, among other things, that we and certain of our officers violated federal securities laws by making allegedly false and misleading statements concerning our financial reporting, revenue recognition, internal controls, and disclosure controls and procedures, prior to our August 3, 2017 announcement. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees. In addition, on August 22, 2017, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed alleging, among other things that certain of our officers and our directors had breached fiduciary duties and had been unjustly enriched and had made allegedly false and misleading statements concerning our financial reporting, revenue recognition, internal controls, and disclosure controls and procedures. The complaint alleges that the Company has suffered damages and seeks an unspecified amount of damages, restitution, and declaratory and other relief.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits and we may be subject to other similar litigation in the future. Monitoring and defending against legal actions, whether or not meritorious, is time-consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with litigation. Although we maintain insurance coverage, recovery could be denied or prove to be insufficient. We are not currently able to estimate the possible cost to us from the currently pending lawsuits, and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve these matters or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay. We have not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to these or future lawsuits. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions could result in the payment of substantial damages and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the uncertainty of the currently pending lawsuits could lead to more volatility in our stock price.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, and foreign employment laws and may face claims in the future under such laws.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, and foreign employment laws and from time to time face claims by our employees and former employees under such laws. There are no material claims pending or threatened\nagainst us under federal, state, or foreign employment laws, but we cannot be sure that material claims under such laws will not be made in the future against us, nor can we predict the likely impact of any such claims on us, or that, if asserted, we would be able to successfully resolve any such claims without incurring significant expense.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information.\nWe rely on copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret protection, in addition to nondisclosure agreements, licensing, and cross-licensing arrangements to establish, maintain, and protect our intellectual property rights, all of which afford only limited protection. We have patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and various foreign countries. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from our pending applications or from any future applications, or that, if issued, any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any failure to adequately protect our proprietary information could harm our financial condition and operating results. We cannot be certain that any patents that have been, or may in the future be issued to us, or which we license from third parties, or any other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. In addition, we cannot be certain that any rights granted to us under any patents, licenses, or other proprietary rights will provide adequate protection of our proprietary information.\nMany countries in which we derive revenue do not have comprehensive and highly developed legal systems, particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights, which, among other things, can result in a prevalence of infringing products and counterfeit goods in certain countries, which could harm our business and reputation.\nAs different areas of our business change or mature, from time to time we evaluate our patent portfolio and decide to either pursue or not pursue specific patents and patent applications related to such areas. Choosing not to pursue certain patents, patentable applications, and failing to file applications for potentially patentable inventions, may harm our business by, among other things, enabling our competitors to more effectively compete with us, reducing potential claims we can bring against third parties for patent infringement, and limiting our potential defenses to intellectual property claims brought by third parties.\nLitigation has been, and may continue to be, necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights. Such litigation, whether or not concluded successfully, could involve significant expense and the diversion of our attention and other resources, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe face risks from third party claims of infringement and potential litigation.\nThird parties have claimed in the past, and may claim in the future, that our products infringe, or may infringe, their proprietary rights. Such claims have resulted in lengthy and expensive litigation in the past and could have a similar result in the future. Such claims and any related litigation, whether or not we are successful in the litigation, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing, we cannot assure that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may be subject to risk of loss due to fire because certain materials we use in our ink formulation process are flammable.\nWe use flammable materials in the digital UV curable and ceramic digital ink formulation process; therefore, we may be subject to risk of loss resulting from fire. The risk of fire associated with these materials cannot be completely eliminated. We own certain facilities that manufacture or warehouse our ink, which increases our exposure to such risk. We maintain insurance policies to cover losses caused by fire, including business\ninterruption insurance. If one or more of these facilities is damaged or otherwise ceases operations as a result of fire, it would reduce our digital UV curable and ceramic digital ink manufacturing capacity, which may reduce revenue and adversely affect our business.\nThe location and concentration of our facilities subject us to risk of earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters.\nOur corporate headquarters, including a significant portion of our research and development facilities, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is known for seismic activity. This area has also experienced flooding in the past. Many of the components necessary for our products are purchased from suppliers based in areas that are subject to risk from natural disasters including the San Francisco Bay Area, China, and Japan. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, flood, tsunami, hurricane, typhoon, or other business interruptions due, for example, to power shortages and other interruptions have harmed our business, financial condition, and operating results in the past and could do so again in the future.\nWe may be subject to environmental-related liabilities due to our use of hazardous materials and solvents.\nOur business operations involve the use of certain hazardous materials at eight locations. We formulate UV curable, reactive dye, and ceramic ink at four locations and store UV curable, ceramic, solvent, and thermoforming ink, as well as a variety of textile ink including dye sublimation, pigmented, reactive dye, acid dye, and water-based dispersed printing ink at eight locations. We formulate and market ceramic solvent-based ink at our facility in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The solvents used in ceramic digital ink formulation have low volatility by design. As a result, ceramic digital ink poses less environmental risk compared with true solvent ink. We launched internal formulation of reactive dye ink during 2016 at our facility in Bedford, U.K. Reactive dye is a water-based dye.\nThe hazardous materials and solvents that we use are subject to various governmental regulations relating to their transfer, handling, packaging, use, and disposal. We store ink at warehouses worldwide, including Europe, China, Israel, the U.K., and the U.S., and shipping companies distribute ink at our direction. We face potential liability for problems such as large spills or fires that may arise at ink manufacturing locations. While we customarily obtain insurance coverage typical for this kind of risk, such insurance may not be sufficient. If we fail to comply with these laws or an accident involving our ink waste or chemicals occurs, or if our insurance coverage is not sufficient, then our business and financial results could be harmed.\nFuture sales of our products could be limited if we do not comply with current and future environmental and chemical content regulations.\nWe believe that our products are currently compliant with RoHS, WEEE, REACH, and other regulations for the European Union as well as with China RoHS and other applicable international, U.S., state, and local environmental regulations. We monitor environmental compliance regulations to ensure that our products are fully compliant prior to the implementation of any potential new requirements. However, new unforeseen legislation could require us to re-engineer our products, complete costly analyses, or perform supplier surveys, which could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results. We could also incur additional costs, sanctions, and liabilities in connection with non-compliant product recalls, regulatory fines, and exclusion of non-compliant products from certain markets.\nEnvironmental regulations and their enforcement have tightened in China, which has resulted in the closure of facilities without notice. Although such closures have not occurred with respect to our suppliers, the unexpected shutdown of supplier factories in China may impact our supply of raw material for digital inkjet ink. Some of our ceramic printing customers in China have experienced plant closures due to stricter environmental enforcement, which has impacted our sales of ceramic ink and may impact our sales in the future.\nOur products may contain defects, which are not discovered until after shipping, which could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty reserves.\nOur products consist of hardware and software developed by ourselves and others, which may contain undetected defects. We have in the past discovered software and hardware defects in certain of our products after their introduction, resulting in warranty expense and other expenses incurred in connection with rectifying such defects or, in certain circumstances, replacing the defective product, which may damage our relationships with our customers. Defects could be found in new versions of our products after commencement of commercial shipment and any such defects could result in a loss or delay in market acceptance of such products and thus harm our reputation and revenue. Defects in our products (including defects in licensed third-party software) detected prior to new product releases could result in delays in the introduction of new products and the incurrence of additional expense, which could harm our operating results. We generally provide a thirteen-month hardware limited warranty commencing upon installation for certain Industrial Inkjet printers, which may cover both parts and labor. Our Fiery DFE limited warranty is 12 to 15 months.\nOur standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions, including but not limited to alteration, modification, misuse, mishandling, and storage or operation in improper environments. While we recorded an accrual of $16.3 million at December 31, 2017, for estimated warranty costs that are estimable and probable based on historical experience, we may incur additional costs of revenue and operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect adequately the cost to resolve or repair defects in our products or if our liability limitations are declared enforceable, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could adversely affect our revenue.\nMaintaining the security of our software and hardware products is an issue of critical importance to our customers and for us. There are individuals and groups who develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products. Although we take preventive measures to protect our products, and we have a response team that is notified of high risk malicious events, these procedures may not be sufficient to mitigate damage to our products. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, reduce or delay future purchases, or purchase competitive products. Customers may also increase their expenditures to protect their computer systems from attack, which could delay or reduce purchases of our products. Any of these actions or responses by customers could adversely affect our revenue.\nSystem failures, or system unavailability, could harm our business.\nWe rely on our network infrastructure, internal and external technology systems and websites for our operations, development, marketing, support, and sales activities. These systems are also subject to potential disruptions and acts of vandalism. Any event that causes failures or interruption in our hardware or software systems could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack.\nWe have experienced cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information. Prior cyber-attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our business or financial results; however, this may not continue to be the case in the future. Cyber security assessment analyses undertaken by us have identified and prioritized steps to enhance our cyber security safeguards. We are in the process of implementing these recommendations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our information or that we will not experience any future successful attacks. Due to the evolving nature of security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted, and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our cyber security protective measures,\nto investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications. In addition, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses. These costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our operations, the services we provide to our customers, our financial results or our reputation; or such events could result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts or other intellectual property or early obsolescence of our products and services.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the occurrence of these or any other material weaknesses could have a material adverse effect on our ability to report accurate financial information in a timely manner.\nAs described in \u201cItem 9A, Controls and Procedures\u201d, our management concluded that we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 related to operational changes, which may impact revenue recognition, insufficient staffing levels, and inventory valuation practices at our Italian manufacturing location. Therefore, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or effective disclosure controls and procedures, both of which are requirements of the Exchange Act, as of that date. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Following the identification of the material weaknesses, management implemented remediation plans, which were ongoing as of December 31, 2017. Because there was insufficient time as of December 31, 2017, to demonstrate that the new controls implemented as part of the remediation plan were operating effectively as of that date, management concluded that the material weaknesses described in \u201cItem 9A, Controls and Procedures\u201d, still existed as of December 31, 2017.\nThe remedial measures we are undertaking may not be adequate to prevent future misstatements or avoid other control deficiencies or material weaknesses. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.\nOur stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from a low of $25.54 to a high of $51.15. We expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nability to initiate or complete stock repurchase programs;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products or services by our competitors or by us;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to strategic relationships, acquisitions, or investments;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our customers regarding their businesses or the products in which our products are included;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nany failure to meet security analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the securities analysts\u2019 rating of our securities;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks and the affects of military engagements or natural disasters;\n\u2022\ncommencement of litigation or adverse results of pending litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial performance and/or market valuations of other software and high technology companies; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions.\nBecause of this volatility, we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts from time to time and the trading price of our securities could decline as a result. The stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of high technology companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results.\nThe value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate volatility.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of fixed income debt securities classified as available-for-sale securities. As a result, our investment portfolio is subject to counterparty risk and volatility if market interest rates fluctuate.\nWe attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of less than three years; however, we may be unable to successfully limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations. This may cause volatility in our investment portfolio value.\nWe are partially self-insured for certain losses related to employee medical and dental coverage. Our self-insurance reserves may not be adequate to cover our medical and dental claim liabilities.\nWe are partially self-insured for certain losses related to employee medical and dental coverage, excluding employees covered by health maintenance organizations. We generally have a stop loss deductible of $0.5 million per enrollee. We have accrued a contingent liability of $0.9 million as of December 31, 2017, which is not discounted, based upon examination of historical trends, historical actuarial analysis, our claims experience, total plan enrollment (including employee contributions), population demographics, and other various estimates. Although we do not expect that we will ultimately pay claims significantly different from our estimates, self-insurance reserves, net income (loss), and cash flows could be materially affected if future claims differ significantly from our historical trends and assumptions.\nOur stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility.\nIn November 2015, our board of directors authorized $150 million for the repurchase of our outstanding common stock. This authorization expires December 31, 2018. On September 11, 2017, the board of directors approved the repurchase of an additional $125 million for our share repurchase program commencing September 11, 2017. At that time, $28.8 million remained available for repurchase under the 2015 authorization. The 2017 authorization thereby increased the repurchase authorization to $153.8 million of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, $109.4 million remained available for repurchase under this authorization.\nAny repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility. There can be no assurance that repurchases will be made at the best possible price. Potential risks and uncertainties also include, but are not necessarily limited to, the amount and timing of future stock repurchases and the origin of funds used for such repurchases. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to\nbe higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time. Any such suspension could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nOur profitability may be affected by unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign countries. Intercompany transaction pricing can impact our tax liabilities. We are potentially subject to tax audits in various countries and tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatments, including intercompany pricing or other matters, and assess additional taxes. We regularly review the likely outcomes of these audits to determine whether our tax provisions are sufficient. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the final assessments of these audits can have a material impact on our net income (loss).\nOur effective tax rate in the future may be impacted by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, new information discovered during the preparation of our tax returns, deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, and enactment of future U.S. and foreign tax legislative initiatives, such as tax reform legislation (\u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017 in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) or multi-jurisdictional actions to address \u201cbase erosion and profit-shifting\u201d by multinational companies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, issued a series of reports on October 5, 2015 recommending changes to numerous well-established tax principles. These recommendations, if adopted by various OECD countries in which we do business, could adversely affect our effective tax rate.\nThe 2017 Tax Act will have a broad range impact on our tax liability, current business deductions, and the U.S. taxation of income earned by our foreign subsidiaries. Many of the provisions significantly differ from current U.S. tax law resulting in changes to tax reporting and potentially increasing tax liabilities incurred.\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted, which includes a broad range of changes affecting businesses, including corporate tax rates, business deductions, and international tax provisions. Many of the provisions significantly differ from current U.S. tax law. The enactment of the 2017 Tax Act requires companies to recognize the effects of changes in tax law and rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities and the retroactive effects of changes in tax laws in the period in which the new legislation is enacted in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 740, Income Taxes. These effects of changes in tax law are recorded as a discrete item and part of tax expense or benefit in continuing operations, regardless of the category of income or loss to which the deferred taxes relate.\nIn accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (\u201cSAB\u201d) 118, we determined that measurement of certain income tax effects can be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2017, and we recorded a $27.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a provisional estimate. While we have calculated a reasonable estimate of the impact of the U.S. tax rate reduction and the amount of the deemed repatriation transition tax, we are still gathering additional information to refine and finalize our calculation of the impacts on our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, the deemed repatriation transition tax, and other provisions associated with the 2017 Tax Act. Changes to these estimates and provisional amounts may affect our financial results.\nThe 2017 Tax Act also will also significantly impact the year ending December 31, 2018, including, but not limited to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a minimum tax to address base erosion and profit shifting from the U.S., the elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, a new tax on global intangible low-tax income (\u201cGILTI\u201d), a limitation of deductible interest expense, and the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction. There are additional limitations imposed on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, the use of foreign tax credits to reduce U.S. income tax\nliabilities, and the utilization of net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017. These changes in tax law may affect both our financial results and our taxes paid.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (\u201cNotes\u201d) in cash, repay the Notes at maturity, or repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change.\nIn September 2014, we completed a private placement of $345 million principal amount of Notes. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as described in Note 7-Convertible Senior Notes, Note Hedges, and Warrants of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUpon conversion of the Notes, we will be required to make conversion payments in cash, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion, as described in Note 7-Convertible Senior Notes, Note Hedges, and Warrants of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Moreover, we will be required to repay the Notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing when the Notes are to be repurchased, converted, or at their maturity.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, we would be required to settle all or a portion of the conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash (such as the Notes) could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, requires us to separately account for the liability and equity components of the Notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects our non-convertible debt interest rate. Accordingly, the equity component of the Notes is included in additional paid-in capital within stockholders\u2019 equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to recognize non-cash interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in current and future periods as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their principal amount over their term. We will report lower net income (loss) because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the original issue discount and the Notes\u2019 non-convertible interest rate. This could adversely affect our future consolidated financial results, the trading price of our common stock, and the trading price of the Notes.\nUnder certain circumstances, in calculating earnings per share, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash are accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method. The effect of the treasury stock method is that the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, diluted earnings per share is calculated\nas if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess were issued, if we elected to settle such excess in shares. We cannot be sure that accounting standards will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method in the future. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, then our diluted consolidated earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nCertain provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and under Delaware law could delay or impair a change in control.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of the Company deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows the board of directors to issue preferred stock, which may include powers, preferences, privileges, and other rights superior to our common stock, thereby limiting our stockholders\u2019 ability to transfer their shares and may affect the price they are able to obtain. Our amended and restated bylaws do not allow stockholders to call special meetings and include, among other things, procedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, which may have the effect of delaying or impairing attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, to commence proxy contests, or to effect changes in control or hostile takeovers of the Company.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes restrictions on certain transactions between a corporation and certain significant stockholders. These provisions could also have the effect of delaying or impairing the removal or replacement of management, proxy contests, or changes in control. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that has the effect of delaying or impairing a change in control of the Company could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could affect the price that certain investors may be willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 77971, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "EFII"}
