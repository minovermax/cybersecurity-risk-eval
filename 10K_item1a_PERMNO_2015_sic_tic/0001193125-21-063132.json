{"cik": "751978", "company": "VICOR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K\ncontains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, the risk factors set forth below.\nOperational Risks\nOur future operating results are difficult to predict and are subject to fluctuations.\nOur operating results, including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and net income (loss), have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis. Our strategic focus on higher volume opportunities with OEMs, ODMs, and contract manufacturers has caused the actions of a relative few such customers to disproportionately influence our operating results. Unanticipated delays in purchase orders from, and shipments to, certain large customers have resulted in lower than expected revenue. Similarly, our strategic focus on the development of market-leading technologies and manufacturing processes, often implemented in proprietary semiconductor circuitry, materials, and packaging, has exposed the Company to the risks and costs of delays in such development and the use of a relatively few number of suppliers of proprietary circuits and materials or providers of proprietary services.\nDespite recent profitability trends, we cannot predict if we will maintain sustained profitability. Our future operating results may be materially influenced by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for our products and for our customers\u2019 end-products\nincorporating our products, as well as our ability to respond efficiently to such changes in demand, including changes in delivery lead times and the volume of product for which orders are accepted and the product shipped within an individual quarter;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage our supply chain, inventory levels, and our own manufacturing capacity or that of third-party partners, particularly in the event of delays or cancellations of significant customer orders or in the event of delays or cost increases associated within our supply chain;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively coordinate changes in the mix of products we manufacture and sell, while managing our ongoing transition in organizational focus and manufacturing infrastructure to Advanced Products from Brick Products;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide and maintain a high level of sales and engineering support to an increasing number of demanding, high volume customers;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our third party suppliers, and service subcontractors to provide us sufficient quantities of high quality products, components, and/or services on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our ongoing efforts to continuously reduce manufacturing costs and manage operating expenses;\n\u2022\nour ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities and personnel at efficient levels, maintaining sufficient production capacity and necessary manufacturing yields;\n\u2022\nour ability to plan, schedule, and execute capacity expansion, including the anticipated addition in 2021 of approximately 90,000 square feet to our Andover manufacturing facility;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our new product introductions and our ability to meet customer expectations for timely delivery of fully qualified products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product introductions or other competitive actions (e.g., product price reductions) by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe ability to hire, retain, and motivate qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;\n\u2022\nintellectual property disputes;\n\u2022\nlitigation-related costs, which may be significant;\n\u2022\nadverse economic conditions in the U.S. and those foreign countries in which we operate, as well as our ability to respond to unanticipated developments, such as the imposition of tariffs or trade restrictions; and\n\u2022\nadverse budgetary conditions within the U.S. government, particularly the Department of Defense, which continue to influence spending on current and anticipated programs into which we sell or anticipate to sell our products;\n\u2022\ncosts related to compliance with increasing worldwide governance, quality, environmental, and other regulations;\n\u2022\ncosts and consequences of disruption by third-parties of our global computer network and related resources;\n\u2022\nthe effects of events outside of our control, including public health emergencies, natural disasters, terrorist activities, political risks, international conflicts, information security breaches, communication interruptions, and other force majeure\n.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we cannot assure you we will not experience significant fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors, the market price of our Common Stock may decline.\nGlobal economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19\npandemic could materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated operating results.\nDuring 2020, economic conditions varied by region, and were rapidly and significantly influenced by the COVID-19\npandemic. The COVID-19\npandemic and the response of governments worldwide to contain its spread negatively influenced our financial and operational performance for all four quarters of 2020, and future developments may have a potentially more substantial negative influence on our financial and operational performance over an unknown period of time.\nOur deliveries to and orders from North American industrial and defense electronics customers declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic, during the first quarter of 2020, given reduced manufacturing activity and broad uncertainty. The second half of 2020 saw a recovery of North American activity to pre-pandemic\nlevels. We believe domestic demand will further improve once the COVID-19\npandemic is substantially contained and uncertainties are reduced, but we cannot predict when this will occur.\nTrading conditions in China (inclusive of Hong Kong, our largest international market), had deteriorated through 2019 due to macroeconomic and trade-related uncertainties. At the beginning of 2020, trading conditions were significantly further affected by the COVID-19\npandemic, with much of the country\u2019s manufacturing disrupted for January and February 2020. By late March 2020, after aggressive measures to contain the coronavirus, the Chinese government quickly implemented economic stimulus measures, and we experienced a rapid recovery of demand from China and Hong Kong. This demand was sustained through the remainder of 2020. As addressed in our discussion herein of market characteristics, exports to China and Hong Kong for 2020 totaled approximately $93,000,000, representing approximately 31.4% of total revenue for the year. We believe this volume was primarily associated with the stimulus spending of the Chinese government, although we also believe an unquantifiable amount of this volume may have been associated with accelerated purchasing by customers anticipating further deterioration of the trade relationship between China and the U.S., which, if it were to occur, could substantially limit purchases by such customers. Our belief is based on input from our\ndistribution partners in China, as well as the mix of products exported over the past three years, reflecting the transfer by our OEM customers for Advanced Products (and their contract manufacturers) of the majority of production programs from China and Hong Kong to other countries in order to avoid inbound and outbound tariffs. Exports to China and Hong Kong peaked at approximately $109,000,000 in 2018, but that figure included approximately $50,000,000 of exports of Advanced Products to OEM customers and their contract manufacturers. As stated, the majority of the programs associated with this amount have been transferred to other countries.\nWe anticipate demand in 2021 from China and Hong Kong will approximate recent quarterly levels, based on information from our customers and distribution partners, and assuming the COVID-19\npandemic is substantially contained. Should China\u2019s economic stimulus policies change or if there is a further deterioration of trade relations between the U.S. and China, such demand may decline. However, we cannot predict if or when circumstances may change, nor can we predict the amount by which bookings or shipments may change.\nWe have taken action to protect the health and safety of our workforce and to otherwise minimize the potential impact of the coronavirus on our operations, the costs of which, to date, have not had a material effect on our financial performance. We expect to maintain the measures put in place until we determine the COVID-19\npandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business, and we may take further actions we consider to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, business partners, and suppliers or in response to government mandate or requirement. Such further actions may have a negative influence on our costs and productivity and, in turn, our financial and operational performance.\nOur customers, business partners, and suppliers have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19\npandemic, which also may contribute to a negative influence on our future financial and operational performance.\nGlobal economic and political uncertainties, notably those associated with trade policy, could materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated operating results.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, revenues from sales outside the United States were 64.4%, 53.7%, and 62.0%, respectively, of our total revenues. Net sales to customers in China and Hong Kong, our largest international market, accounted for approximately 31.4% in 2020, approximately 22.1% in 2019, and approximately 37.4% in 2018, respectively, of total net sales. We expect international sales, notably in Asia, will continue to be a significant component of total sales, since many of the OEMs and ODMs we target as customers are domiciled offshore, and such customers increasingly utilize offshore contract manufacturers, and rely upon those contract manufacturers to place orders directly with us. We also expect international revenue from our distributors to continue to increase.\nTo date, we have not experienced material delays or reduced raw material availability as a result of trade disputes between the U.S. and China, including the imposition in 2018 of import tariffs under the provisions of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411) (\u201cSection 301 Tariffs\u201d) on certain Chinese goods imported into the United States. However, the costs of Section 301 Tariffs have had a material impact on our profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Section 301 Tariffs totaled approximately $7,259,000, an increase of 37% over the $5,280,000 incurred for 2019. For 2020 and 2019, Section 301 Tariffs totaled approximately 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively, of annual revenue, representing a material reduction in our gross profit margin as a percentage of annual revenue.\nWe continue to evaluate alternative sources of raw materials, and, in late 2020, we qualified non-Chinese\nvendors for certain high-volume raw materials and components. We anticipate a reduction in Section 301 Tariffs we incur during 2021, given the ongoing transition to non-Chinese\nvendors, but we are not able to estimate the amount of such reduction, if any. Similarly, we cannot predict if or when the U.S. government may reduce or eliminate Section 301 Tariffs.\nWe also have filed \u201cduty drawback\u201d applications with U.S. Customs and Border Protection for the recovery of Section 301 Tariffs paid on raw materials and components used to produce products we subsequently exported. At this time, we have received no such recovery, and we are not able to estimate the amount of any recovery or the timing thereof.\nIn 2019, China implemented reciprocal inbound tariffs of up to 25% on products exported from the U.S., including all of our products. We do not believe these tariffs, incurred by our Chinese and Hong Kong distributors, have had a material impact on the unit volume or dollar value of our exports to China, which we attribute to the differentiated performance of our products in market segments in which we have an established presence. However, we cannot predict the long-term influence of these tariffs on our competitive position in China, especially in light of the increased pressure by the Chinese government on Chinese manufacturers to meet the \u201cChina 2025\u201d mandate for targeted development of Chinese technology sectors. Under this mandate, domestic technology vendors are explicitly favored over foreign vendors such as Vicor. We believe we experienced reduced demand in certain segments (e.g., rail), notably in 2019, reflecting the significant role of state-owned enterprises in those segments. We regularly assess the competitive position and profitability of certain product lines sold in China and Hong Kong, and may choose to reduce our product offerings if competitive conditions and reduced profitability so warrant.\nUncertain macroeconomic conditions, extended trade disputes, and the relative strength of the U.S. Dollar may reduce end-demand\nfor our customers\u2019 products and, in turn, their purchases of our products, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings. In addition, such adverse conditions may, among other things, result in increased price competition for our products, notably in our Brick Product categories, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers, increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues.\nOur operating results recently have been influenced by a limited number of customers, and our future results may be similarly influenced.\nSince the introduction of our Advanced Products, the Company has derived the majority of its revenue from Advanced Products in any given year from either one customer or a limited number of customers, whether through sales directly to the customer(s) or indirectly to the customers\u2019 contract manufacturers. This concentration of revenue is a reflection of the relatively early stage of adoption of the Advanced Products and the associated technologies and power system architectures, and our targeting of market leading innovators as initial customers.\nOur current sales and marketing efforts are focused primarily on accelerating the adoption of Advanced Products by a diversified customer base, across a number of identified market segments. While we believe we have been successful to date in diversifying our Advanced Products customer base beyond early adopters, we cannot assure you our strategy will be successful and further diversification of customers will be achieved.\nWe may not be able to procure necessary key components or raw materials, or we may purchase excess raw material inventory or unusable inventory, which increases the risk of reserve charges to reduce the value of any inventory deemed excess or obsolete, thereby reducing our profitability.\nThe power systems industry, and the electronics industry as a whole, can be subject to pronounced, lengthy business cycles and otherwise subject to sudden and sharp changes in demand. Our success, in part, is dependent on our ability to forecast and procure inventories of components and materials to match production schedules and customer delivery requirements. Many of our products require raw materials supplied by a limited number of vendors and, in some instances, a single vendor. During certain periods, key components or materials required to build our products may become unavailable in the timeframe required for us to meet our customers\u2019 needs. Our inability to secure sufficient raw materials to manufacture products for our customers has reduced, in the past, our revenue and profitability and could do so again.\nWe may choose, and have chosen, to mitigate our inventory risks by increasing the levels of inventory for certain components and materials. Such increased inventory levels may increase the potential risk for excess or obsolete inventories, should our forecasts fail to materialize or if there are negative factors impacting our customers\u2019 end markets, leading to order cancellation. If we identify excess inventory or determine certain inventory is obsolete (i.e., unusable), we likely will record additional inventory reserves (i.e., expenses representing the write-off\nof the excess or obsolete inventory), which could have an adverse effect on our gross margins and on our operating results.\nWe rely on third-party vendors and subcontractors for supply of components, assemblies, and services and, therefore, cannot control the availability or quality of such components, assemblies, and services.\nWe depend on third-party vendors and subcontractors to supply components, assemblies, and services used to manufacture our products, some of which are supplied by a single vendor. We have experienced shortages of certain semiconductor components and delays in service delivery, have incurred additional and unexpected costs to address the shortages and delays, and have experienced our own delays in production and shipping.\nIf suppliers or subcontractors cannot provide their products or services on time or to our specifications, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products and our delivery times may be negatively affected. In addition, we cannot directly control the quality of the products and services provided by third parties. In order to expand revenue, we likely will need to identify and qualify new suppliers and subcontractors to supplant or replace existing suppliers and subcontractors, which may be a time-consuming and expensive process. In addition, any qualification of new suppliers may require customers of our products utilizing products and services from new suppliers and service providers to undergo a re-qualification\nprocess. Such circumstances likely would lead to disruptions in our production, increased manufacturing costs, delays in shipping to our customers, and/or increases in prices paid to third parties for products and services.\nAs previously disclosed, we rely on a third-party partner to provide certain manufacturing steps associated with a proprietary Advanced Products packaging process. This process, developed with the third-party partner, involves complex metal surface finishing, performed on equipment developed by the third-party partner. An important, differentiating benefit of this proprietary process is that it does not generate problematic effluent, resulting in an environmentally safe approach to metal surface finishing, with minimal waste. We have entered into agreements with the third-party partner for production and transfer of technologies and process know-how,\nincluding the purchase of the enabling equipment developed by the third-party partner.\nTo date, we have successfully relied upon this third-party partner to perform these manufacturing steps, although we have experienced delivery delays associated with the third-party partner\u2019s volume constraints. This experience caused us to accelerate our schedule for establishing our own high-volume capabilities in-house,\nmodifying, in 2020, our construction plans to accommodate a dedicated, on-premises\nmetal surface finishing facility. We expect to rely on our third-party partner for production requirements through the installation and qualification for production of the enabling equipment in the addition to our Andover manufacturing facility. We also expect to rely on our third-party partner in the future for surge capacity requirements.\nIf the third-party partner cannot deliver sufficient volumes to us, we are unable to complete our facility expansion in a timely manner, or if we are unable to effectively implement the new manufacturing processes, we may not be able to achieve the expected volumes or production capacity and, as a result, may experience reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries, and/or increased expenses, any of which could negatively influence our financial condition and results of operations.\nExtended interruption of production at our manufacturing facility in Andover, Massachusetts, could materially reduce our revenue, increase our costs, and, potentially, negatively impact our customers.\nThe majority of our power components and power systems, whether for direct sale to customers or for sale to our subsidiaries for incorporation into their respective products, are manufactured in our Andover facility.\nSubstantial damage to our existing manufacturing facility due to fire, natural disaster, power loss, or other events, including disruptive events associated with our ongoing expansion of the facility, could interrupt manufacturing, contributing to lengthy shipment delays that could have a negative impact on customers and, in turn, our customer relationships. While we have never experienced any meaningful interruption of manufacturing in our history, any prolonged inability to utilize all or a significant portion of our Andover facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAn extended delay in completing our capacity expansion could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and negatively impact our ability to execute on our Advanced Products strategy.\nWe have been making and will continue to make capital investments for the expansion of manufacturing capacity for the production of Advanced Products at our Andover facility. Based on our extended long-term volume forecast, we anticipate additional capacity will be required to meet expected customer requirements. During the second quarter of 2020, we began construction of an approximately 90,000 square feet, two-story\naddition to our existing plant, and that construction continues on schedule.\nThe addition to our facility includes installation of certain equipment and implementation of certain manufacturing steps associated with Advanced Products manufacturing processes we currently outsource to a third-party partner, as described above. These manufacturing processes are associated with a proprietary packaging approach requiring complex metal surface finishing using environmentally safe technologies. Given our volume expectations and the proprietary elements of these processes, we have chosen to accelerate the development of a captive capacity that we expect will exceed the total capacity available from our third-party partner. Today, we own and operate, with our employees, certain equipment on premises at our third-party partner and, as such, have established a level of operational competence we believe will enable us to successfully install and implement these manufacturing processes internally. However, we may experience delays and incur additional costs during 2021 in implementing the manufacturing processes, given the complexity of the installation and qualification of the equipment.\nOnce the facility expansion has been completed and all manufacturing equipment installed and qualified for volume production, we may not achieve the anticipated production volumes and operating efficiencies. Any delay in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with added capacity may cause manufacturing costs to be higher than expected for some period of time, thereby potentially negatively influencing our operating and financial results.\nDisruption of our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend heavily on our computing and communications infrastructure to achieve our business objectives, particularly for our financial and operational record keeping, our computer-integrated manufacturing processes controlling all aspects of our operations in our manufacturing facility in Andover, Massachusetts, our public website, and our email communications. We also rely on trusted third parties to provide certain infrastructure support services to us. If we or a third party service provider encounter a problem that impairs this infrastructure, the resulting disruption could impede the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting processes, and our ability to record or process customer orders, manufacture, and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Our image and reputation also could be negatively affected by such circumstances. Additionally, we could incur material liabilities associated with the harm such impairment and disruption of our infrastructure may have on third parties including those associated with the unintentional release of confidential information and/or sensitive data. While we carry business interruption insurance to offset financial losses from such an interruption, and cyber-risk insurance to address potential liabilities from such circumstances, such insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant costs or liabilities incurred. Any such events, if prolonged, could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOn December 24, 2019, elements of our network were compromised by a form of malware referred to as \u201cransomware.\u201d In close collaboration with our service provider, we had restored computing and network functions to full operational status by the afternoon of December 27, 2019. Subsequent analysis by management and the forensic specialists we retained allowed us to conclude the incident had no material impact on our operations, financial condition and performance, or the integrity of our financial reporting systems. In response to the vulnerabilities identified, we have substantially enhanced network and file security through expanded and improved system monitoring, network and file access procedures, user training, and emergency response protocols. However, even with our expanded commitment to continuous improvement of the security of our information technology infrastructure, we can offer no assurance that we will be successful in detecting or preventing network security incidents and associated disruptions in the future.\nOur systems are designed to protect us from network security incidents and associated disruptions. However, as evidenced by the ransomware incident described above, we remain vulnerable to computer viruses and related software-based challenges to the integrity of our systems, unauthorized or illegal break-ins,\nor malicious network hacking, equipment or software sabotage, acts of vandalism to our systems by third parties, and, in the extreme, forms of cyber-terrorism. Our security measures or those of our third party service provider detected, but did not prevent, the network security incident and the associated disruptions described above and may not detect or prevent such incidents and disruptions in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were compliant with the comprehensive requirements for the protection of controlled unclassified information (\u201cCUI\u201d) as set forth in Special Publication 800-171\nof the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\u201cNIST\u201d). The Company provides confidential information to third party business partners and/or receives confidential information from third party business partners in certain circumstances, when doing so is necessary to conduct business, particularly with departments of agencies of the U.S. Government. While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect other sensitive information (i.e., information not considered CUI), our own security measures or those of our third party service providers may not be sufficient to protect such information in the event the computing infrastructure of these third party business partners is compromised. Security incidents involving our computing and communications infrastructure or that of a third party business partner or service provider could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized release of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in an interruption to our operations, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation, or damage our reputation, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our network segmented NIST 800-171\nenvironment was not impacted by the December 2019 ransomware incident, but there can be no assurance that it will not be impacted by similar incidents in the future, which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for the reasons described above.\nWe may face legal claims and litigation from product warranty or other claims that could be costly to resolve.\nWe have in the past and may in the future encounter legal action from customers, vendors, or others concerning product warranty or other claims. We generally offer a two-year\nwarranty from the date title passes from us for all of our standard products. Effective January 1, 2017, we extended the warranty period to three years for a range of H Grade, M Grade and MI Family DC-DC\nlegacy products sold after that date. In a limited number of circumstances, we have entered into supply contracts with certain high-volume customers calling for extended warranty terms. With our distribution partners, we also enter into contracts providing for our product warranties to transfer to the end customer upon final sale of our product(s) by the distributor.\nWe invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to our warranty policies. These issues may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product\nreturns, which may adversely influence our operating results. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality, or compatibility problems, the Company\u2019s reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. We are currently party to a limited number of supply agreements with certain customers contractually committing us to warranty and indemnification requirements exceeding those to which we have been exposed in the past. While we maintain insurance coverage for such exposure, we could incur significant financial cost beyond the limits of such coverage, as well as operational disruption and damage to our competitive position and image if faced with a significant product warranty or other claim.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be limited if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain the services of our executive officers. The loss of one or more members of senior management could materially adversely influence our business and financial results. In particular, we are dependent on the services of Dr. Vinciarelli, our founder, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President. The loss of the services of Dr. Vinciarelli could have a material adverse effect on our development of new products and on our results of operations. On February 24, 2021, James A. Simms notified us of his decision to resign from his positions as our Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and Secretary effective June 30, 2021. We have initiated a search for a new Chief Financial Officer. Such leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes, it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals. In addition, our research and development and marketing and sales activities depend on highly skilled engineers and other personnel with technical skills, who are in high demand and are difficult to replace. Our continued operations and growth depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel in a very competitive employment market. If we are unable to attract and retain such employees, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be harmed.\nCompetitive Risks\nWe compete with many companies possessing far greater resources.\nSome of our competitors have far greater financial, manufacturing, technical, and sales and marketing resources than we possess or have access to. Our Brick Products compete with those products offered by domestic and foreign manufacturers of integrated power supplies and related power conversion components. With our Advanced Product lines, we compete with global IDMs and fabless developers of semiconductor-based power management modules and power management ICs. These competitors have far larger organizations and broader semiconductor-based product lines. Competition is generally based on product performance, design flexibility (i.e., ease of use), product price, and product availability, but with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets, and customers.\nExisting or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, or lower cost. Larger competitors frequently seek to maintain market share and protect customer relationships through heavily-discounted pricing, which we may not be able to match. If we fail to develop and commercialize leading-edge technologies and products that are cost effective and maintain high standards of quality, and introduce them to the market on a timely basis, our competitive position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to develop and market differentiated, leading-edge power conversion products for larger customers, potentially contributing to lengthy product development and sales cycles that may result in significant expenditures before revenues are generated. Our future operating results are dependent on the growth in such customers\u2019 businesses and on our ability to profitably develop and deliver products meeting customer requirements.\nThe power system industry and the industries in which many of our customers operate are characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, quickened product obsolescence, and price erosion for mature\nproducts, each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We are following a strategy based on the development of differentiated Advanced Products addressing what we believe to be the long-term limitations of traditional power architectures, while at the same time sustaining sales and profitability of our well-established Brick Products. The development of new, innovative products is often a complex, time-consuming, and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. Although we have introduced many Advanced Products over recent years, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to develop and introduce new and improved products and power system concepts in a timely or efficient manner. Similarly, there can be no assurance recently introduced or to be developed products will achieve customer acceptance.\nOur future success depends substantially upon customer acceptance of our innovative Advanced Products, notably our Power-on-Package\nconcept in AI and other high-performance applications. As we have been in the early stages of market penetration for these and other Advanced Products, we have experienced lengthy periods during which we have focused our product development efforts on the specific requirements of a limited number of large customers, followed by further periods of delay before meaningful purchase orders are received. These lengthy development and sales cycle times increase the possibility a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result, we may incur significant product development expenses, as well as significant sales and marketing expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.\nWe continue to shift our go-to-market\nstrategy to focus on larger opportunities with global OEMs, ODMs, and contract manufacturers. Our growth is therefore dependent on: the pace at which these OEMs and ODMs develop their own new products; the acceptance of our Advanced Products by these OEMs and ODMs; and the success of the customers\u2019 products incorporating our Advanced Products. If we fail to anticipate changes in our customers\u2019 businesses and their changing product needs or do not successfully identify and enter new markets, our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted.\nIn 2020, we further expanded our dedicated sales effort to penetrate the automotive market with our Advanced Products, notably in the rapidly expanding 48V opportunity within the electric vehicle and mild hybrid vehicle market segments. The automotive market is dominated by relatively few global OEMs and \u201ctiers\u201d of well-established suppliers. Penetrating this market will be challenging and we may not be successful in doing so. Additionally, our early success with vendors of AI computing solutions may not translate into long-term success with customers participating in the long-term development of autonomous driving solutions.\nWe cannot offer any assurance the markets we currently serve will grow in the future, our Advanced Products or Brick Products will meet respective market requirements, or we can maintain adequate gross margins or operating profits in these markets.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.\nWe operate in an industry in which the ability to compete depends on the development or acquisition of proprietary technologies that must be protected to preserve the exclusive use of such technologies. We devote substantial resources to establish and protect our patents and proprietary rights, and we rely on patent and intellectual property law to protect such rights. This protection, however, may not prevent competitors from independently developing products similar or superior to our products. We may be unable to protect or enforce current patents, may rely on unpatented technology that competitors could restrict or replicate, or may be unable to acquire patents in the future, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. In addition, the intellectual property laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as those\nof the United States. We have been defending and may need to continue to defend or challenge patents. We have incurred and expect to incur significant financial costs in the defense of our patented technologies and have devoted and expect to devote significant resources to these efforts which, if unsuccessful, may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nWe face intellectual property infringement claims that could be disruptive to operations and costly to resolve and may encounter similar infringement claims in the future.\nThe power supply industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. We have in the past and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or manufacturing processes infringe on a third party\u2019s patent or other intellectual property rights. Such assertions, if publicly disclosed, have in the past and may in the future inhibit the willingness of potential customers to purchase certain of our products. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced to either redesign or stop production of products incorporating that technology, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, litigation may be necessary to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly, extend over a lengthy period of time, and divert the attention of key personnel. An adverse outcome in these types of matters could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nPlease see Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding current litigation related to our intellectual property.\nAny expenses or liability resulting from the outcome of litigation could adversely influence our operating results and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to claims or litigation, including intellectual property litigation as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAny such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, require us to change our products, or have other adverse effects on our business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could require us to pay significant monetary damages.\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is considered probable an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, our evaluation led us to conclude no accrual of a loss contingency was warranted.\nRegulatory Risks\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) requires our management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with the requirements of SOX and to continuously improve and, when necessary, remediate internal controls over financial reporting.\nWhile management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. In the event our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, our certifying officers under SOX, or our independent registered public accounting firm determines our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could materially harm our business. In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by government authorities or self-regulatory organizations, such as the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. Any such actions could affect investor perceptions of the Company and result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline or limit our access to capital.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals (including gold, tantalum, tin, and tungsten, and their related ores), originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC released final rules for annual disclosure and reporting for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. We began to implement processes within our supply chain to comply with these rules beginning in 2012 filed our initial Form SD in May 2014, and have filed Form SD annually since then. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including due diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nRisks Related to Share Value\nThe price of our Common Stock has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.\nBecause of the factors set forth above and below, among others, the trading price of our Common Stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly:\n\u2022\nvolatility of the financial markets, notably the equity markets in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding the prospects of domestic and foreign economies, including the impact of volatile currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding domestic and international political conditions, including tax, trade, and tariff policies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating performance or that of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe performance and prospects of our major customers, including their adoption of technologies or standards other than those in which we specialize;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, or litigation;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of the Company and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of the market for our Common Stock, reflecting a relatively low trading float and relatively low average trading volumes;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of the declaration and payment of future cash dividends on our Common Stock; and\n\u2022\nthe concentration of ownership of our Common Stock by Dr. Vinciarelli, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President.\nIn the past, we have declared and paid cash dividends on our Common Stock. The payment of dividends is based on the periodic determination by our Board of Directors that we have adequate capital to fund anticipated operating requirements and that excess cash is available for distribution to stockholders via a dividend. We have no formal policy regarding dividends and, as such, investors cannot make assumptions regarding the possibility of future dividend payments nor the amounts and timing thereof. As of December 31, 2020, we have no plans to declare or pay a cash dividend.\nThe ownership of our Common Stock is concentrated between Dr. Vinciarelli and a limited number of institutional investors. As of December 31, 2020, Dr. Vinciarelli was the beneficial owner of 10,014,454 shares of our Common Stock, plus 155,977 shares which Dr. Vinciarelli has the right to acquire upon exercise of options to purchase Common Stock within 60 days of December 31, 2020. He also holds 11,023,648 shares of our unregistered Class B Common Stock (which may only be sold or transferred after required conversion, on a one-for-one\nbasis, into registered shares of Common Stock), which together with his ownership of Common Stock, represents 49.6% of our total issued and outstanding shares of capital stock. Accordingly, the market float for our Common Stock and average daily trading volumes are relatively small, which may negatively impact investors\u2019 ability to buy or sell shares of our Common Stock in a timely manner.\nDr. Vinciarelli owns 93.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock, which possess 10 votes per share. Dr. Estia J. Eichten, a member of our Board of Directors, owns the majority of the balance of the Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. As such, Dr. Vinciarelli, controlling in aggregate 80.4% of our outstanding voting securities, has effective control of our governance.", "PERMNO": 76128, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "VICR"}
