{"cik": "1013238", "company": "ARADIGM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nExcept for historical information contained herein, the discussion of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the preparation and filing for regulatory approvals, the maintenance and establishment of corporate partnering arrangements, the anticipated commercial introduction of our products and the timing of our cash requirements. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any such forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, those mentioned in this report and in particular the factors described below. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or other factors that we do not presently perceive to present significant risks to us at this time may also impair our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or the value of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur cash resources will only be sufficient to fund our operations for the first quarter of 2018. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 has indicated in its audit opinion, contained in our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, that our current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.1 million as of December 31, 2017, will only be sufficient to fund our operations for the first quarter of 2018. We will not be able to maintain our current level of regulatory and product development activity and there is substantial doubt about our company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern unless we raise additional capital in early 2018. Accordingly, we intend to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities, royalty financing transactions, strategic transactions or otherwise, to fund our operations and to continue the development of our lead product candidate Linhaliq. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in raising additional capital on favorable terms or at all. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations. If we are unable to obtain additional funds when required, it may delay or reduce the scope of all or a portion of our development programs, or require us to dispose of our assets or technology or to cease operations, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nChanging circumstances may cause us to expend cash significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more cash than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. For these reasons, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities.\nWe have received a CRL from the FDA which states that it cannot approve the NDA for Linhaliq in its present form. Even if we resubmit the NDA for Linhaliq, the FDA may not approve Linhaliq for marketing.\nWe have focused primarily on the development of our lead product candidate Linhaliq for the treatment of NCFBE. In July 2017, we submitted the NDA for Linhaliq to the FDA based on the positive results from the ORBIT-4 study in the Phase 3 clinical program for Linhaliq and confirmatory evidence from the ORBIT-2 and ORBIT-3 studies. In January 2018, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding the NDA for Linhaliq which states that the FDA determined it cannot approve the NDA in its present form and provides specific reasons for this action along with recommendations needed for resubmission; the areas of concern include clinical data, human factors validation study and product quality. The recommendations in the CRL include an independent third party verification of the Phase 3 results via analyses of source data as per the statistical analysis plan and an additional Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates a significant treatment effect on clinically meaningful endpoints which could evaluate the co-primary endpoints of frequency and severity of exacerbations to assess for durable evidence of efficacy over a period of two years (or more, if scientifically justified). The CRL also included a request to conduct another Human Factors Study to demonstrate that the product packaging and instructions for use are effective, and the CRL requested, among other things, additional product quality information with respect to microbiology and a new in vitro drug release method development report. The Company plans to request a Type A post-action meeting with the FDA to discuss the topics covered in the CRL with the view to developing plans to move towards resubmission of the Linhaliq NDA. While we currently plan to resubmit the NDA for Linhaliq, we cannot assure you that we will be able to resubmit the NDA, that the information previously provided, or to be provided, to the FDA will be adequate to address the recommendations made in the Linhaliq CRL or that we will be successful in obtaining FDA approval of Linhaliq. Even if we resubmit an NDA for Linhaliq, the FDA could require us to complete further clinical, Human Factors or other studies, which could further delay or preclude any approval of the NDA and require us to obtain significant additional funding. In addition, the FDA may choose not to approve our NDA for any of a variety of reasons, including a decision related to the safety or efficacy data for Linhaliq, or for any other issues that it may identify related to our development of Linhaliq for the treatment of NCFBE.\nChanges to our management and board of directors may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business, and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention, our stock price, and our revenue, operating results, and financial condition.\nSince February 2018, there have been significant changes in our management and board of directors. For example, several members of management have departed the Company. Effective February 11, 2018, each of Igor Gonda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Juergen Froehlich, Chief Medical Officer; and Nancy Pecota, Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary resigned all offices and positions held by him or her with Aradigm. In addition, in February, 2018, Dr. Gonda and David Bell resigned from the Board of Directors. In addition, in February 2018, our board of directors approved temporary measures intended to preserve our cash resources until additional sources of capital can be identified, and we reduced our headcount. These changes, and the potential for additional changes to our management, organizational structure and strategic business plan, may cause speculation and uncertainty regarding our future business strategy and direction. These changes may cause or result in:\n\u2022\ndisruption of our business or distraction of our employees and management;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in recruiting, hiring, motivating and retaining talented and skilled personnel;\n\u2022\nstock price volatility; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in negotiating, maintaining or consummating business or strategic relationships or transactions.\nIf we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks, our revenue, operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nWe have a history of net losses and a large accumulated deficit, we expect to incur net losses for at least the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have never been profitable and have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2017, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $455.2 million. We have not had any direct product sales and do not anticipate receiving revenues from the sale of any of our products in 2018, if ever. We expect to incur net losses over the next several years and may never become profitable. While our agreement with our partner Grifols has resulted in reduced net operating losses and capital expenditures as a portion of our research and development expenses for the Linhaliq program was reimbursed by Grifols through 2015, we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue drug product development efforts;\n\u2022\nconduct preclinical testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022\npursue additional applications for our existing delivery technologies; and\n\u2022\noutsource the commercial-scale production of our products.\nThe amount of future losses is uncertain and will depend, in part, on the rate of growth of our expenses.\nTo achieve and sustain profitability, we must, alone or with others such as Grifols, successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, market and sell our products. We expect to incur substantial expenses in our efforts to develop and commercialize products, and we may never generate sufficient product or contract research revenues to become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. We are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to complete the processes described above, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, including the requirement of approval before any of our product candidates can be marketed. We may not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates on a timely basis, or at all.\nDrug development is an inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development. We and our products are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation in the United States by the federal government, principally the FDA, by state and local government agencies, and also by governmental and regulatory agencies outside the United States, such as the EMA. Both before and after regulatory approval, the development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, and export of our potential products are subject to regulation. Pharmaceutical products that are marketed abroad are also subject to regulation by foreign governments. Our products cannot be marketed in the United States without FDA approval.\nThe process for obtaining FDA approval for drug products is generally lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Despite the time and expense expended, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies can delay approval of, or refuse to approve, our product candidates for a variety of reasons, including failure to meet safety and/or efficacy endpoints in our clinical trials.\nRegulatory authorities may delay or not approve our product candidates even if the product candidates meet safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials or the approvals may be too limited for us to earn sufficient revenues.\nOur pharmaceutical product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials. Even if a product candidate is approved, it may be approved for fewer or more limited\nindications than requested or the approval may be subject to the performance of significant post-marketing studies that can be long and costly. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Any limitation, condition or denial of approval or label changes would have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, and results of operations.\nEven if we are granted initial FDA approval for any of our product candidates, we may not be able to maintain such approval, which would reduce our revenues.\nEven if we are granted initial regulatory approval for a product candidate, the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies can limit or withdraw product approvals for a variety of reasons, including failure to comply with regulatory requirements, changes in regulatory requirements, problems with manufacturing facilities or processes or the occurrence of unforeseen problems, such as the discovery of previously undiscovered side effects. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in warning letters, imposition of civil penalties or other monetary payments, delay in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recall or seizure, operating restrictions, interruption of clinical trials or manufacturing, injunctions and criminal prosecution. If we are able to obtain any product approvals, they may be limited or withdrawn, or we may be unable to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements. Both before and after approval we, our present and future collaborators and our products are subject to a number of additional requirements. For example, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims are subject to additional FDA review and approval. Advertising and other promotional material must comply with FDA requirements. We, our collaborators and our manufacturers will be subject to continuing review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other authorities, where applicable, and must comply with ongoing requirements, including the FDA\u2019s GMP requirements. Once the FDA approves a product, a manufacturer must provide certain updated safety and efficacy information, submit copies of promotional materials to the FDA and make certain other required reports. Product approvals may be withdrawn if regulatory requirements are not complied with or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval. Any limitation or withdrawal of approval of any of our products could delay or prevent sales of our products, which would adversely affect our revenues. Further continuing regulatory requirements may involve expensive ongoing monitoring and testing requirements.\nWe are a development-stage company and will require substantial capital to complete the development of our product candidates and commercialize them. Any such future financing could result in dilution to shareholders or increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants or other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nWe are a development-stage company, and our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends on our ability to successfully complete the development of our product candidates. All of our potential products are in research or development, and we will need to raise additional capital prior to approval and commercialization of our lead product candidate, Linhaliq. Our potential drug products require extensive research and development, including pre-clinical and clinical testing. Our potential products also may involve lengthy regulatory reviews before they can be sold. Because none of our product candidates has yet received approval by the FDA, we cannot assure you that our research and development efforts will be successful, any of our potential products will be proven safe and effective, or regulatory clearance or approval to sell any of our potential products will be obtained. We cannot assure you that any of our potential products can be manufactured in commercial quantities with quality systems acceptable to the regulatory authorities at an acceptable cost or marketed successfully. We may abandon the development of some or all of our product candidates at any time and without prior notice. We must incur substantial up-front expenses to develop and commercialize products and failure to achieve commercial feasibility, demonstrate safety, achieve clinical efficacy, obtain regulatory approval or successfully manufacture and market products will negatively impact our business. Running clinical trials and developing an investigational drug for commercialization involve significant expense, and any unexpected delays or other issues in the development process can result in significant additional expense.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity financings, royalty or debt financings, corporate alliances, joint ventures or licensing agreements. We may sell additional equity or debt securities to fund our operations, which would result in dilution to all of our shareholders or impose restrictive covenants that may adversely impact our business. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves, or cease operations and liquidate.\nWe are in a highly competitive market, and our competitors have developed or may develop alternative therapies for our target indications, which would limit the revenue potential of any product we may develop.\nWe compete with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and drug delivery companies, hospitals, research organizations, individual scientists and nonprofit organizations engaged in the development of drugs and therapies for the disease indications we are targeting. Our competitors may succeed, and many already have succeeded, in developing competing technologies for the same disease indications, obtaining FDA approval for products or gaining acceptance for the same markets that we are targeting. If we are not \u201cfirst to market,\u201d it may be more difficult for us and our present and future collaborators to enter markets as second or subsequent competitors and become commercially successful.\nWe are aware of a number of companies that are developing or have developed therapies to address indications we are targeting, including major pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer. For example, Bayer has developed an inhaled dry powder formulation of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of respiratory infections in CF and NCFBE. Bayer filed an NDA for U.S. approval and was accepted for Priority Review. In November 2017, the FDA\u2019s Advisory Committee voted not to recommend Bayer\u2019s dry powder ciprofloxacin to be approved for the treatment of bronchiectasis. Bayer in its 2017 Annual Report have announced that they have decided to discontinue development of Cipro DPI in NCFBE for the time being and will evaluate possible further options for this asset.\nThere are a number of other inhaled products under development to treat respiratory infections, including a nebulized levofloxacin by Raptor (acquired by Horizon) for CF and bronchiectasis, and a nebulized liposomal amikacin by Insmed for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium (a pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection). These and many other potential competitors have greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution, financial and managerial resources and experience than we have and may have products and product candidates that are on the market or in a more advanced stage of development than our product candidates. Our ability to earn product revenues and our market share would be substantially harmed if any existing or potential competitors brought a product to market before we or our present and future collaborators were able to, or if a competitor introduced at any time a product superior to or more cost-effective than ours.\nIn addition, we believe there are a number of additional drug candidates and pulmonary delivery technologies in various stages of development that, if approved, could compete with any future products we may develop.\nBecause our inhaled ciprofloxacin programs may rely on the FDA\u2019s and EMA\u2019s grant of orphan drug designation for potential market exclusivity, the product may not be able to obtain market exclusivity and could be barred from the market in the US for up to seven years or European Union for up to ten years.\nThe FDA has granted orphan drug designation for our liposomal ciprofloxacin drug product candidate for the management of CF and BE and to our ciprofloxacin for inhalation drug product for the management of bronchiectasis. FDA also granted orphan drug designation to our proprietary drug product of liposomal ciprofloxacin for the management of CF. Orphan drug designation is intended to encourage research and development of new therapies for diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States. The designation provides the opportunity to obtain market exclusivity, even in the absence of a granted patent or other intellectual property protection, for seven years from the date of the FDA\u2019s approval of an NDA. However, the market exclusivity is granted only to the first chemical entity to be approved by the FDA for a given indication. Therefore, if another similar inhaled ciprofloxacin product were to be approved by the FDA for a CF or NCFBE indication before our product, then we may be blocked from launching our product in the United States for seven years, unless we are able to demonstrate to the FDA clinical superiority of our product on the basis of safety or efficacy. For the NCFBE indication, Bayer has obtained orphan drug status for their inhaled powder formulation of ciprofloxacin in the United States for the treatment of bronchiectasis and in the United States and European Union for the treatment of CF. Bayer filed an NDA for U.S. approval, however in November 2017 the FDA\u2019s Advisory Committee voted not to recommend Bayer\u2019s dry powder ciprofloxacin to be approved for the treatment of bronchiectasis.\nIn August 2009, the EMA granted orphan drug designation to our inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin drug product candidate Lipoquin (ARD-3100) for the treatment of lung infections associated with CF. Under European guidelines, Orphan Medicinal Product Designation provides 10 years of potential market exclusivity if the product candidate is the first product candidate for the indication approved for marketing in the EU. We may seek to develop additional products that incorporate drugs that have received orphan drug designations for specific indications. In each case, if our product is not the first to be approved by the FDA or European Medicines Agency for a given orphan indication, we may not be able to access the target market in the United States and/or the EU, which would adversely affect our ability to earn revenues.\nOur dependence on collaborators and other third parties may delay or require that we terminate certain of our programs, and any such delay or termination would harm our business prospects and stock price.\nWe used contract research organizations (CROs) to conduct our global Phase 3 clinical trials and are using contract research organizations for other analysis and testing activities. We may not be able to maintain satisfactory contract research arrangements, or we may have contractual disputes with such CROs that could adversely impact the timelines for the delivery of data or other materials from the CRO. If our CROs are delayed in their activities or issues are uncovered regarding the quality of the data provided by the CROs it could result in significant delays in our Linhaliq program and adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate.\nOur commercialization strategy for certain of our product candidates depends on our ability to enter into or maintain agreements with collaborators, such as our collaboration with Grifols, and to obtain assistance and funding for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Supporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and other terms of a collaboration agreement are long and complex processes with uncertain results. Collaborations may involve greater uncertainty for us, as we have less control over certain aspects of our collaborative programs than we would over a proprietary development and commercialization program. We may determine that continuing a collaboration under the terms provided is not in our best interest and, if we are able to under the terms of the agreement, we may terminate the collaboration. Our collaborators could delay or terminate their agreements with us, and our products subject to collaborative arrangements may never be successfully commercialized. Under our existing collaboration agreement with Grifols, we have granted Grifols exclusive rights with respect to inhaled\nciprofloxacin compounds for other indications besides the treatment of NCFBE, and we have limited ability to terminate that agreement.\nFurther, our present or future collaborators may pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, and the priorities or focus of our collaborators may shift such that our programs receive less attention or resources than we would like, or they may be terminated altogether. Any such actions by our collaborators may adversely affect our business prospects and ability to earn revenues. In addition, we could have disputes with our present or future collaborators, such as the interpretation of terms in our agreements. Any such disagreements could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of any potential products or could result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration, which may not be resolved in our favor.\nEven with respect to certain other programs that we intend to commercialize ourselves, or programs that Grifols has declined its exclusive right to fund and commercialize, we may enter into agreements with collaborators to share in the burden of conducting clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing our product candidates or products. In addition, our ability to apply our proprietary technologies to develop proprietary drugs will depend on our ability to establish and maintain licensing arrangements or other collaborative arrangements with the holders of proprietary rights to such drugs. We may not be able to establish such arrangements on favorable terms or at all, and our future collaborative arrangements may not be successful.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend, on contract manufacturers and collaborators: if they do not perform as expected, our revenues and customer relations will suffer.\nWe do not have the ability to manufacture the materials we use in our pre-clinical and clinical trials and commercial operations. Rather, we rely on various third-party contract manufacturers to produce our products. There may be long lead times to obtain materials. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, contract with, qualify and obtain prior regulatory approval for additional sources of materials. We may also not be able to maintain satisfactory contract manufacturing arrangements with our current contract manufacturers. If we are not, there may be a significant delay before we find an alternative contract manufacturer or we may not find an alternative contract manufacturer at all. If there are any interruptions in this supply for any reason, including a decision by the third parties to discontinue manufacturing, technical difficulties, labor disputes, natural or other disasters, or a failure of the third parties to follow regulations, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our investigational drug candidates and may not be able to successfully commercialize these investigational drug candidates.\nOur third-party contract manufacturers and collaborative partners may encounter delays and problems in manufacturing our investigational drug candidates and future commercial products for a variety of reasons, including accidents during operation, failure of equipment, delays in receiving materials, natural or other disasters, political or governmental changes, or other factors inherent in operating complex manufacturing facilities. Supply-chain management is difficult. Commercially available starting materials, reagents, excipients, and other materials may become scarce, more expensive to procure, or not meet quality standards, and we may not be able to obtain favorable terms in agreements with subcontractors. Our third-party contract manufacturers may not be able to operate manufacturing facilities in a cost-effective manner or in a time frame that is consistent with our expected future manufacturing needs. If our third-party manufacturers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party manufacturers and other service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us for any reason, such interruption could delay progress on our programs, or interrupt the commercial supply, with the potential for additional costs and lost revenues. If this were to occur, we might also need to seek alternative means to fulfill our manufacturing needs.\nFurther, we, our contract manufacturers and our collaborators are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s GMP requirements that relate to product testing, quality assurance, manufacturing and maintaining records and documentation. We and our contract manufacturers or our collaborators may not be able to comply with the\napplicable GMP and other FDA regulatory requirements for manufacturing, which could result in an enforcement or other action, prevent commercialization of our product candidates and impair our reputation and results of operations.\nIf any products that we or our collaborators may develop do not attain adequate market acceptance by healthcare professionals and patients, our business prospects and results of operations will suffer.\nEven if we or our collaborators successfully develop one or more products, such products may not be commercially acceptable to healthcare professionals and patients, who will have to choose our products over alternative products for the same disease indications. Many of these alternative products may be more established and acceptable than ours. For our products to be commercially viable, we will need to demonstrate to healthcare professionals and patients that our products afford benefits to the patients that are cost-effective as compared to the benefits of alternative therapies. Our ability to demonstrate this depends on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe demonstration of efficacy and safety in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe existence, prevalence, and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nthe potential or perceived advantages or disadvantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market entry relative to competitive treatments;\n\u2022\nthe pricing relative to competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe relative cost, convenience, product dependability and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe sufficiency of coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by governmental and other third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nthe product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries.\nOur product revenues will be adversely affected if, due to these or other factors, the products we or our collaborators are able to commercialize do not gain significant market acceptance.\nWe depend upon our proprietary technologies, and we may not be able to protect our potential competitive proprietary advantage.\nAny of our pending or future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents and any patents issued may be subjected to further proceedings limiting their scope and may in any event not contain claims broad enough to provide meaningful protection. Any patents that are issued to us or our present and future collaborators may not provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage and may be circumvented or invalidated. In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost. Further, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following commercialization of products.\nWe may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and any litigation could force us to stop selling potential products and could be costly, divert management attention and harm our business.\nWe must be able to commercialize products without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. Because the markets in which we operate involve established competitors with significant patent portfolios, including patents relating to compositions of matter, methods of use and methods of drug delivery, it could be difficult for us or our collaborator Grifols to use our technologies or commercialize products without infringing\nthe proprietary rights of others. We may not be able to design around the patented technologies or inventions of others, and we may not be able to obtain licenses to use patented technologies on acceptable terms, or at all. If we cannot operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, we will not earn product revenues. For example, we are aware of patents recently issued in the U.S. and assigned to Insmed with claims covering methods of treatment with quinolone antibiotics, which includes ciprofloxacin, against pulmonary infections. We filed a PGR petition in the PTAB challenging the validity of the claims of Insmed\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 9,402,845 or the \u2018845 Patent. In a PGR, a petitioner may request that the PTAB reconsider the validity of issued patent claims and any patent claim PTAB determines to be unpatentable is stricken from the challenged patent. In August 2017, Insmed filed a Preliminary Response to our petition. In November 2017, PTAB denied institution of our post-grant review of the \u2018845 Patent. We are currently assessing the PTO\u2019s decision.\nIf we or our collaborator Grifols are required to defend an infringement lawsuit, we could incur substantial costs, and the lawsuit could divert management\u2019s attention, regardless of the lawsuit\u2019s merit or outcome. These legal actions could seek damages and seek to enjoin testing, manufacturing, and marketing of the accused product or process. In addition to potential liability for significant damages, we could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the accused product or process and any license required under any such patent may not be made available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, or we could incur significant expenses in royalty payments to a licensor.\nPeriodically, we review publicly available information regarding the development efforts of others in order to determine whether these efforts may violate our proprietary rights. We may determine that litigation is necessary to enforce our proprietary rights against others. Such litigation could result in substantial expense, regardless of its outcome, and may not be resolved in our favor.\nFurthermore, patents already issued to us or our pending patent applications may become subject to dispute, and any disputes could be resolved against us. In addition, patent applications in the United States are currently maintained in secrecy for a period of time prior to issuance and patent applications in certain other countries generally are not published until more than 18 months after they are first filed. Publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications on such inventions. For example, we are aware of patents recently issued in the U.S. and assigned to Insmed with claims covering methods of treatment with quinolone antibiotics, which includes ciprofloxacin, against pulmonary infections.\nIf our future clinical trials are delayed for any reason, we would incur additional costs and delay the potential receipt of revenues.\nBefore we or any current or future collaborators can file for regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our potential products, the FDA will require extensive preclinical safety testing and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy. Completing clinical trials in a timely manner depends on many factors. Delays in completing any future clinical trials may result in increased costs, program delays, or both, and the loss of potential revenues.\nIf we do not continue to attract and retain key employees, our product development efforts will be delayed and impaired.\nWe depend on a small number of key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management, clinical, regulatory and development personnel. There is a shortage of skilled personnel in our industry, we face competition in our recruiting activities, and we may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel. Our former President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Igor Gonda, our former Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Juergen Froehlich, and our former Chief Financial Officer, Nancy Pecota resigned on February 11, 2018. These resignations and losing any of our\nremaining key employees could impair our product development efforts and otherwise harm our business. Any of our employees may terminate their employment with us at will.\nIf we market our products in other countries, we will be subject to different laws and regulations, and we may not be able to adapt to those laws and regulations, which could increase our costs while reducing our revenues.\nIf we market any approved products in foreign countries, we will be subject to different laws and regulations, particularly with respect to intellectual property rights and regulatory approval. To maintain a proprietary market position in foreign countries, we may seek to protect some of our proprietary inventions through foreign counterpart patent applications. Statutory differences in patentable subject matter may limit the protection we can obtain on some of our inventions outside of the United States. The diversity of patent laws may make our expenses associated with the development and maintenance of intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions more expensive than we anticipate. We will not obtain the same patent protection in every market in which we may otherwise be able to potentially generate revenues. In addition, in order to market our products in foreign jurisdictions, we and our present and future collaborators must obtain required regulatory approvals from foreign regulatory agencies and comply with extensive regulations regarding safety and quality. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in such jurisdictions, and we may have to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining any foreign regulatory approvals. If approvals to market our products are delayed, if we fail to receive these approvals, or if we lose previously received approvals, our business would be impaired as we could not earn revenues from sales in those countries.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims, which would hurt our reputation, market position, and operating results.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates in humans and will face an even greater risk upon commercialization of any products. These claims may be made directly by consumers or by pharmaceutical companies or others selling such products. We may be held liable if any product we develop causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing or sale. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims would likely result in negative publicity, decreased demand for any products that we may develop, injury to our reputation and suspension or withdrawal of clinical trials. Any such claim will be very costly to defend and also may result in substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or customers, loss of revenues and the inability to commercialize products that we develop. Although we currently have clinical trials and product liability insurance, we may not be able to maintain such insurance or obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms, in amounts sufficient to protect our business, or at all. A successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we cannot arrange for adequate third-party reimbursement for our products, our revenues will suffer.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our potential products will depend in substantial part on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payors such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Third-party payors often challenge the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products. Any products we are able to develop successfully may be deemed not reimbursable by third-party payors. In addition, our products may not be considered cost-effective, and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a profit. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before our products are approved for marketing and any such changes could further limit reimbursement. If any products we develop do not receive adequate reimbursement, our revenues will be severely limited.\nOur use of hazardous materials could subject us to liabilities, fines, and sanctions.\nOur laboratory and clinical testing sometimes involves the use of hazardous and toxic materials. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing how we use, manufacture, handle, store and dispose of these materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply in all material respects with all federal, state and local regulations and standards, there is always the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and such liability could exceed our financial resources. Compliance with environmental and other laws may be expensive and current, or future regulations may impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nIf we are unable to effectively implement or maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial results and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for that fiscal year. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Reform Act, became law. The Reform Act includes a provision that indefinitely exempts companies that qualify as either a non-accelerated filer or smaller reporting company from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. For our fiscal 2016 and subsequent foreseeable fiscal years, we expect to be exempt from such requirement. However, our ability to comply with the annual internal control report requirements will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and controls across our company. We expect these systems and controls to involve significant expenditures and to become increasingly complex as our business grows. To effectively manage this complexity, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation or operation of these controls, could harm our operating results and cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could adversely affect our business and reduce our stock price.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees, on our network servers, located in our data centers. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, damage our reputation and adversely impact our operating results. Numerous United States federal and state laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws, and federal and consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, and disclosure of health-related and other personal information. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural\ndisasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such an event could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is likely to remain volatile.\nThe market prices for securities of many companies in the drug delivery and pharmaceutical industries, including ours, have historically been highly volatile, and the market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. The market prices for our common stock may also be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe limited trading volume for shares of our common stock and the fact that a large percentage of our outstanding shares are held by a small number of shareholders;\n\u2022\nannouncements of clinical trial results, technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ndelays in the development or approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nsales of our stock by certain large institutional shareholders;\n\u2022\nresearch analyst recommendations and our ability to meet or exceed quarterly performance expectations of analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain or establish collaborative relationships;\n\u2022\npublicity regarding actual or potential developments relating to products under development by our competitors or us;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of us;\n\u2022\nconcern of the public or the medical community as to the safety or efficacy of our products, or products deemed to have similar safety risk factors or other similar characteristics to our products;\n\u2022\nfuture sales or expected sales of substantial amounts of common stock by shareholders;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise capital; and\n\u2022\neconomic and other external factors.\nIn the past, class action securities litigation has often been instituted against companies promptly following volatility in the market price of their securities, and a class action securities suit was instituted against us in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the decline in the market price of our common stock Any such litigation against us may, regardless of its merit, result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nNasdaq has notified us that we are no longer in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements. If we fail to regain compliance, we will be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. If we are delisted, our stock price may decline and the liquidity of our securities and our ability to raise capital could be significantly impaired.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq. In order to maintain that listing, we must sustain a minimum market value of listed securities of $35 million or shareholder\u2019s equity of at least $2.5 million, among other requirements for continued listing. On March 7, 2018 we received a notice from Nasdaq that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), as we have not maintained a minimum of $2,500,000 in our shareholder\u2019s equity. The notification of noncompliance has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cARDM.\u201d Pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have 180 days, or until September 4, 2018, to regain compliance with the minimum shareholder\u2019s equity requirement. The notification of noncompliance has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock on Nasdaq.\nHowever, if we are unable to meet these requirements, we will be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. Even if we regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, we cannot assure you that we will be able to main compliance in future periods.\nIf our stock is delisted from Nasdaq, this would likely impair the liquidity of our securities not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price, which might be depressed by the relative illiquidity, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and the potential reduction in media coverage. As a result, an investor may find it significantly more difficult to dispose of our common stock, and our ability to raise future capital through the sale of the shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock could be materially limited. If we are delisted from Nasdaq, trading in our shares of common stock may be conducted, if available, on the OTC Bulletin Board Service or, if available, via another market.\nOn February 28, 2018, we received a notice from Nasdaq that, effective as of the appointment of John Siebert as our Executive Chairman and Interim Principal Executive Officer on February 11, 2018, we are no longer in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s independent director and audit committee requirements as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605. On March 9, 2018, we received a notice from Nasdaq, stating that based on information regarding the appointment of an independent director to the Board and the Audit Committee, the staff of Nasdaq has determined that we now comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605 and that the matter is now closed.\nWe have implemented certain anti-takeover provisions, which may make an acquisition less likely or might result in costly litigation or proxy battles.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the California Corporations Code could discourage a party from acquiring, or make it more difficult for a party to acquire, control of our company without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Certain provisions allow our Board of Directors to authorize the issuance, without shareholder approval, of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 1203 of the California Corporations Code, which requires us to provide a fairness opinion to our shareholders in connection with their consideration of any proposed \u201cinterested party\u201d reorganization transaction.\nWe have adopted a shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a \u201cpoison pill.\u201d We have also adopted an executive officer severance plan (which was temporarily suspended in the first quarter of 2018) and entered into change of control agreements with our executive officers, both of which may provide for the payment of benefits to our officers and other key employees in connection with an acquisition. The provisions of our articles of\nincorporation, our poison pill, our severance plan and our change of control agreements, and provisions of the California Corporations Code may discourage, delay or prevent another party from acquiring us or reduce the price that a buyer is willing to pay for our common stock.\nOne or more of our shareholders may choose to pursue a lawsuit or engage in a proxy battle with management to limit our use of one or more of these anti-takeover protections. Any such lawsuit or proxy battle would, regardless of its merit or outcome, result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Therefore, our shareholders may not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares and, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our shareholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. We cannot assure shareholders of a positive return on their investment if they sell their shares, nor can we assure that shareholders will not lose the entire amount of their investment.\nDisputes may arise between Grifols and us that may be resolved in a manner unfavorable to our other shareholders and us.\nIn August 2013, we entered into several agreements with Grifols as part of the completion of a private sale of shares of common stock to Grifols, including in particular the License Agreement, the Governance Agreement, and a registration rights agreement with respect to shares of common stock owned by Grifols. As a result of the various obligations under these agreements, in addition to Grifols\u2019 ownership of approximately 34.6% of our outstanding common stock, or 47.8% of our common stock if Grifols converts all of its Convertible Notes, conflicts of interest may arise between Grifols and us from time to time. Disagreements regarding the rights and obligation of Grifols under these agreements could create conflicts of interest for one of our directors, who has been designated by Grifols and subsequently nominated by us for election to our board of directors. Any such disagreements could also lead to actual disputes or legal proceedings that may be resolved in a manner unfavorable to our other shareholders and us. In addition, Grifols has a number of consent rights under the Governance Agreement, including the right to consent to any termination of our Chief Executive Officer or our appointment of a successor Chief Executive Officer and certain preemptive rights to participate in any future issuances of common stock (or common stock equivalents) by us or to acquire shares in the open market to maintain ownership thresholds specified in the Governance Agreement. Grifols may exercise any of these rights, or any of its other rights contained in its agreements with us, in a manner which is not necessarily in the best interest of us or our other shareholders. The result of any of these conflicts could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our common stock.\nOur principal shareholders own a large percentage of our common stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.\nA small number of our shareholders own a large percentage of our common stock and can, therefore, influence the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval. Based on information known to us, our two largest shareholders, collectively, beneficially own approximately 67% of the class of our common stock as of March 12, 2018. These two shareholders purchased most of the Convertible Notes and related Warrants described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, leading to a corresponding increase in their respective ownership on a fully-diluted basis. As a result, these shareholders have the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including certain proposed amendments to our amended and restated articles of incorporation (for example, amendments to increase the number of our authorized shares) and any other material transactions we may\nundertake in the future, such as a financing transaction or a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. These shareholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree. The concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of our company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 83622, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "ARDMQ"}
