{"cik": "1426332", "company": "NGM BIOPHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred net losses every year since our inception, expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses and may never be profitable. Our stock is a highly speculative investment.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that was incorporated in 2007 and commenced operations in early 2008. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect and/or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since commencing operations. Our net loss was $42.8 million, $0.5 million and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $196.1 million.\nWe have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant resources to fund research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates. We will require substantial additional capital to achieve our development and commercialization goals for our wholly-owned programs, aldafermin and NGM395, for any future programs that Merck does not opt to license under the Collaboration Agreement and that we choose to develop, for any Merck licensed programs that we opt to co-develop, and for any programs that Merck chooses to license under the Collaboration Agreement and later elects to terminate. We expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses over the next several years as our research, development, preclinical testing, clinical trial and related activities increase. As a result, our accumulated deficit will also increase significantly. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue beyond those generated pursuant to the Merck collaboration. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Even if we eventually generate product revenue, we may never be profitable and, if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nSubstantially all of our revenue for recent periods has been received from a single collaboration partner.\nSince executing the Collaboration Agreement with Merck in 2015, substantially all of our revenue has been from our collaboration partner, Merck. Under the collaboration, Merck provides us with reimbursement for research and development activities of up to $50 million per year, plus additional amounts up to agreed upon annual caps, if certain conditions are met; however, we may require additional funding to advance our research and development affairs on our planned timeline, or at all. If our Merck collaboration were to be terminated, or if the annual cap under the Merck collaboration is insufficient, we could require significant additional capital in order to proceed with development and commercialization of our product candidates, or we may require additional partnering in order to help fund such development and commercialization. Merck has exercised its option to extend the research and early development program through March 16, 2022 and has the right to extend it again through March 16, 2024. If adequate funds or partners are not available to us on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development efforts or other operations.\nWe currently have no source of product revenue and may never become profitable.\nOur product candidates are in the early stages of development. To date, we have not generated any revenue from commercialization of our product candidates. We will not be able to generate product revenue unless and until one of our product candidates, alone or with our partners, successfully completes clinical trials, receives regulatory approval and is successfully commercialized. As our product candidates are in early stages of development, we do not expect to receive revenue from those product candidates for a number of years, if ever. We may seek to obtain revenue from collaboration or licensing agreements with third parties. Other than our agreement with Merck, we currently have no such agreements that could provide us with material, ongoing future revenue and we may never enter into any such agreements. Our ability to generate future product revenue from our current or future product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our or our current collaborator\u2019s and potential future collaborators\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully complete research and clinical development of current and future product candidates;\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties, and ensure adequate and legally compliant manufacturing of bulk drug substances and drug products to maintain sufficient supply;\n\u2022\nlaunch and commercialize any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, if any, and, if launched independently, successfully establish a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate the necessary safety data post-approval to ensure continued regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nobtain coverage and adequate product reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors;\n\u2022\nachieve market acceptance for our or our partners\u2019 products, if any;\n\u2022\nestablish, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nattract, hire and retain qualified personnel.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, including that our product candidates may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or if or when we will achieve or maintain profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we decide, or are required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies or trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we complete the development and regulatory processes described above, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with launching and commercializing these products.\nEven if we generate revenue from the sale of any of our products that may be approved, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or do not sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nWe may require additional capital to finance our operations, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, we may not complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates or develop new product candidates.\nAs a research and development company, our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly to the extent that product candidates whose costs are not borne by our collaborator, such as our wholly-owned programs, aldafermin and NGM395, advance in clinical development. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and funding we expect to receive under our existing Collaboration Agreement, will fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will adequately support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements, both short- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical tests and clinical trials for our current product candidates and any future product candidates we may develop;\n\u2022\nwhether Merck exercises its option to license product candidates upon our completion of proof-of-concept studies for each such candidate in humans;\n\u2022\nwhether Merck terminates the research collaboration under pre-specified circumstances set forth in the Collaboration Agreement or terminates a program that is licensed (such as Merck\u2019s termination of its license for NGM395 and NGM386);\n\u2022\nwhether Merck exercises its remaining option to extend the research phase of its collaboration with us, which would trigger an extension payment to us;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect or to change their requirements on studies that had previously been agreed to;\n\u2022\nthe cost to establish, maintain, expand, enforce and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe effect of products that may compete with our product candidates and market developments;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of any approved product candidates, including product pricing and product reimbursement by third-party payors;\n\u2022\nthe cost of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of selecting, auditing and potentially validating a manufacturing site for commercial-scale manufacturing;\n\u2022\nthe cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval and that we determine to commercialize ourselves or in collaboration with partners; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which any of the foregoing costs are the responsibility of Merck.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates or intellectual property.\nUnless and until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from approved products, we will require additional capital to discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our current and future product candidates. We do not have any committed external source of funds, other than pursuant to our collaboration with Merck, which is limited in scope and duration, and may be terminated in certain circumstances. We expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings or product collaborations. Additional capital may not be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms, if at all, and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our existing stockholders could suffer dilution or be negatively affected by fixed payment obligations we may incur if we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity securities or debt. Furthermore, these securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants or protective rights that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we need to secure additional financing, such additional fundraising efforts may divert our management and research efforts from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. If we do not raise additional capital, we may not be able to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and we may need to:\n\u2022\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue research and discovery efforts and the development or commercialization of any product candidates or cease operations altogether;\n\u2022\nseek strategic alliances for research and development programs when we otherwise would not, or at an earlier stage than we would otherwise desire or on terms less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u2022\nrelinquish, or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to intellectual property or any product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nIf we need to conduct additional fundraising activities, but are unable to do so, we may be prevented from pursuing development and commercialization efforts, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nTo the extent we obtain additional funding through product collaborations, these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish rights to some of our intellectual property, product candidates or products, and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our research and development programs or product candidates.\nWe plan to use current year operating losses and our federal and state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards to offset taxable income from revenue generated from operations, including corporate collaborations. However, our ability to use NOL carryforwards could be limited.\nWe plan to use our current year operating losses to offset taxable income from any revenue generated from operations, including corporate collaborations. To the extent that our taxable income exceeds any current year operating losses, we plan to use our NOL carryforwards to offset income that would otherwise be taxable. However, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the amount of benefits from our NOL carryforwards may be impaired or limited if we incur a cumulative ownership change of more than 50%, as interpreted by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, over a three-year period. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of our IPO and subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. As a result, our use of federal NOL carryforwards could be limited. State NOL carryforwards may be similarly limited. Any such disallowances may result in greater tax liabilities than we would incur in the absence of such a limitation and any increased liabilities could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur product candidates must undergo rigorous clinical trials and regulatory approvals, which could delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates.\nAll of our product candidates will be subject to rigorous and extensive clinical trials and extensive regulatory approval processes implemented by the FDA and similar regulatory bodies in other countries. The approval process is typically lengthy and expensive, and approval is never certain. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or terminated at any time for reasons including:\n\u2022\nongoing discussions with the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, required approvals from IRBs or other governing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in enrolling participants into clinical trials, such as the delay in enrollment we experienced in our ALPINE 2/3 clinical trial;\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated retention rates of participants in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nimplementation of new, or changes to, guidance or interpretations from the FDA or comparable foreign authorities with respect to approval pathways for product candidates we are pursuing, such as draft guidance documents from the FDA for the development of products for the treatment of NASH that issued in 2018 and 2019 and from the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) that issued in 2018;\n\u2022\nthe need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results, poorly executed testing or changes in required endpoints by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities;\n\u2022\ninsufficient supply or deficient quality of product candidate materials or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nunfavorable FDA or comparable foreign authority inspection and review of a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;\n\u2022\nserious and unexpected drug-related adverse effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials; or\n\u2022\nthe placement of a clinical hold on a trial by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities.\nPositive or timely results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials do not ensure positive or timely results in late-stage clinical trials or product approval by the FDA or any other regulatory authority. Product candidates that show positive preclinical or early clinical results often fail in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals.\nWe have limited experience in conducting late-stage clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval. We may not be able to conduct clinical trials at preferred sites, enlist clinical investigators, enroll sufficient numbers of participants or begin or successfully complete clinical trials in a timely fashion, if at all. Our current clinical trials may be insufficient to demonstrate that our potential products will be safe or effective. Additional clinical trials may be required if clinical trial results are negative or inconclusive, which will require us to incur additional costs and significant delays. If we do not receive the necessary regulatory approvals, we will not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we or our collaborators must conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive, take several years to complete and may not yield results that support further clinical development or product approvals. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing.\nTo date, the data supporting our drug discovery and development programs are derived from laboratory and preclinical studies and earlier-stage clinical trials. Despite the results reported in our Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for aldafermin, in Phase 1 clinical trials for NGM313 and NGM120 and in preclinical studies for our other product candidates, future clinical trials in humans may show that one or more of our product candidates are not safe and effective, in which event we may need to abandon development of such product candidates. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Owing in part to the complexity of biological pathways, these compounds might not demonstrate in patients the biochemical and pharmacological properties we anticipate based on laboratory studies or earlier-stage clinical trials, and they may interact with human biological systems or other drugs in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways.\nFurther, we expect that our current product candidates will, and future product candidates may, require chronic administration. The need for chronic administration increases the risk that participants in our clinical trials will fail to comply with our dosing regimens. If participants fail to comply, we may not be able to generate clinical data in our trials acceptable to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. The need for chronic administration also increases the risk that our clinical drug development programs may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients who take our products may eventually experience. The number of patients exposed to treatment with, and the average exposure time to, our product candidates in clinical development programs may be inadequate to detect rare adverse events or chance findings that may only be detected once our products are administered to more patients and for longer periods of time.\nIf we are unable to successfully discover, develop or enable our collaborators to develop drugs that are effective and safe in humans, we will not have a viable business.\nPhase 2 clinical trials of aldafermin that have produced and will produce NASH histology data are ongoing, and the clinical data produced to date are preliminary and have not been subjected to quality control procedures. Preliminary data and interim results may not be predictive of final results.\nWe have ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of aldafermin in NASH. Any data and results we have announced from our first Phase 2 clinical trial, including the topline results from the 24-week cohort announced in February 2020 are preliminary. Until the final data is received, we are unable to perform typical quality control procedures on the data produced to ensure its accuracy. While we believe the data made available to date are accurate, until such time as the final quality control procedures are performed, the data are and should be regarded as preliminary. Preliminary data and interim results may not be predictive of final results and may not be predictive of future results in later-stage clinical trials. Differences between the preliminary data, data from the interim analysis and final data in our aldafermin trials may lead us to make different operational decisions regarding, or incur additional expenses for, the development of aldafermin than we otherwise would if final data were available. Our business and prospects depend on the development of aldafermin and, if final data is less promising than the preliminary data suggests, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.\nSuccess in preclinical studies or earlier-stage clinical trials may not be indicative of results in future clinical trials.\nSuccess in preclinical studies and earlier-stage clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of our product candidates. Similarly, preliminary data and interim results from clinical trials may not be predictive of final results. Frequently, product candidates that have shown promising results in early clinical trials have subsequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials. To date, some of our clinical trials have involved small patient populations at single sites and, because of the small sample size in such trials, the results of these clinical trials may be subject to substantial variability and may not be indicative of either future interim results or final results. In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. Because we have limited experience designing clinical trials, we may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval. In addition, there is a high failure rate for drugs and biologic products proceeding through clinical trials. In fact, many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical studies and earlier-stage clinical trials. Similarly, the outcome of preclinical studies may not predict the success of clinical trials. Moreover, data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, we may experience regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including due to changes in regulatory policy during the period of our product candidate development. Any such delays could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we experience delays in clinical testing, we will be delayed in commercializing our product candidates, our costs may increase and our business may be harmed.\nConducting clinical trials for any of our drug candidates for approval in the United States requires filing an IND application and reaching agreement with the FDA on clinical protocols, finding appropriate clinical sites and clinical investigators, securing approvals for such studies from the IRB at each such site, manufacturing clinical quantities of drug candidates and supplying drug product to clinical sites. Currently, we have multiple active INDs with the FDA in the United States, including for aldafermin for NASH and PBC, for NGM621 for GA secondary to AMD and for NGM120 for treatment of solid tumors and pancreatic cancer. We also have an active Clinical Trial Authorisation in the United Kingdom from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for NGM217 for diabetes and an active Clinical Trial Notification in Australia from the Therapeutic Good Administration for NGM395 for metabolic syndrome.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully accomplish required regulatory activities or all of the other activities necessary to initiate and complete clinical trials. As a result, our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals or successfully commercialize our products. We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in clinical testing. Significant clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which would impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business, results of operations and prospects. Events that may result in a delay or unsuccessful completion of clinical development include:\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nFDA comments on ongoing clinical trials and potential regulatory holds imposed if such comments are not adequately addressed;\n\u2022\ndeviations from the trial protocol by clinical trial sites and investigators, or failures to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure of third parties, such as CROs, to satisfy their contractual duties to us or meet expected deadlines;\n\u2022\ndelays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of the product candidates or other study materials to the clinical sites;\n\u2022\nfor clinical trials in selected patient populations, delays in identification and auditing of central or other laboratories and the transfer and validation of assays or tests to be used to identify selected patients and test any patient samples;\n\u2022\ndelays in patient enrollment, such as the delay in enrollment we experienced in our ALPINE 2/3 clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in patients completing a trial or returning for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by patients dropping out of a trial, including due to side effects or disease progression;\n\u2022\ndemonstration of a significant adverse safety or tolerability signal limiting the utility of the product candidate;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory authority recommendations or guidance regarding development of drugs for a particular indication that we are pursuing, such as draft guidance documents from the FDA for the development of NASH that issued in 2018 and 2019 and from the EMA that issued in 2018;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial sites or investigators from our clinical trials for any reason, including as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials; or\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trials.\nOur or our collaborators\u2019 inability to timely complete clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate product revenue or development, regulatory, commercialization and sales milestone payments and royalties on product sales.\nIf we or our partners are unable to enroll patients in clinical trials, we will be unable to complete these trials on a timely basis.\nThe timely completion of clinical trials largely depends on patient enrollment. Many factors affect patient enrollment, including:\n\u2022\nthe size and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022\nthe number and location of clinical sites we enroll;\n\u2022\ndelays in enrollment due to travel or quarantine policies, or other factors, related to COVID-19;\n\u2022\ncompetition with other companies for clinical sites or patients;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility and exclusion criteria for the trial;\n\u2022\nthe design of the clinical trial;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u2022\nrisk that enrolled participants will drop out before completion; and\n\u2022\ncompeting clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nIn particular, there is significant competition for recruiting NASH patients in clinical trials. For example, we recently announced that enrollment in our ALPINE 2/3 trial of aldafermin had been delayed beyond our initial projections. We or our partners may be unable to enroll the patients we need to complete clinical trials on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe may not successfully identify, develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nThe success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to identify and validate new therapeutic candidates, and to identify, develop and commercialize protein and antibody therapeutics. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. Our research efforts may initially show promise in discovering potential new protein and antibody therapeutics, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour research methodology may not successfully identify medically-relevant protein or antibody therapeutics or potential product candidates;\n\u2022\nour drug discovery efforts tend to identify and select novel, untested proteins in the particular disease indication we are pursuing, which we may fail to validate after further research work;\n\u2022\nwe may need to rely on third parties to generate protein or antibody candidates for some of our product candidate programs;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter product manufacturing difficulties that limit yield or produce undesirable characteristics that increase the cost of manufacturing our product candidates, cause delays or make the product candidates unmarketable;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may cause adverse effects in patients or subjects, even after successful initial toxicology studies, which may make the product candidates unmarketable;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may not demonstrate a meaningful benefit to patients or subjects; and\n\u2022\nour partners may change their development profiles or plans for product candidates or abandon a therapeutic area, the development of a partnered product or the commercialization of any future approved partnered product.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for one or more programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects and could potentially cause us to cease operations. For example, we recently decided to suspend activities related to NGM386 to focus on advancing NGM395, a long-acting GDF15 receptor agonist. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nWe are subject to many manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our product candidates and any future products.\nTo date, aldafermin and our other product candidates have been manufactured by third-party manufacturers solely for preclinical studies and clinical trials. These manufacturers may not be able to scale production to the larger quantities required for large clinical trials and for commercialization. The process of manufacturing aldafermin and our other product candidates is complex, highly regulated and subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe process of manufacturing biologics is susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error and improper storage conditions. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, the manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and eliminate the contamination;\n\u2022\na third-party manufacturer of a product candidate subject to our collaboration with Merck may fail to qualify upon an audit by Merck;\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing facilities in which our products are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor and raw material shortages, financial difficulties of our contract manufacturers, natural disasters, power failures, local political unrest and numerous other factors; and\n\u2022\nany adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the supply of our products. We may also have to record inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek costlier manufacturing alternatives.\nFor example, we have entered into a Development and Manufacturing Services Agreement with Lonza for the production of Phase 3 and commercial supplies of aldafermin. If Lonza is not able to provide us with sufficient quantities of aldafermin for our clinical trials on a timely basis, or at all, whether due to production shortages or other supply interruptions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our clinical trials or regulatory approval may be delayed. Refer to the risk factor entitled \u201cOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, in regions where we or third parties on which we rely have significant manufacturing facilities, concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations. The COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our operations, including at our headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is currently subject to a shelter-in-place order, and at our clinical trial sites, as well as the business or operations of our manufacturers, CROs or other third parties with whom we conduct business.\u201d\nEach of our product candidates uses certain raw materials for its manufacture, such as reagents that support cell growth. Some of these materials only have a single supplier and are purchased as necessary without a long-term supply agreement in place. Any significant delay in the acquisition or decrease in the availability of these raw materials could considerably delay the manufacture of our product candidates, which could adversely impact the timing of any planned trials or the regulatory approvals of our product candidates.\nThe manufacture of biologic products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of biologic products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production and ensuring the avoidance of contamination. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. We cannot assure you that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of our product candidates will not occur in the future.\nWe have limited process development capabilities and have access only to external manufacturing capabilities. We do not have, and we do not currently plan to acquire or develop, the facilities or capabilities to manufacture bulk drug substance or filled drug product for use in clinical trials or commercialization. Any delay or interruption in\nthe supply of clinical trial materials could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of an approved label.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Additional clinical trials may be required to evaluate the safety profile of our product candidates. Serious adverse events that were reported in the aldafermin treatment arms from our completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of aldafermin include: moderate dizziness, community acquired pneumonia, iron deficiency anemia, fractured finger, pneumonitis/alveolitis, acute pancreatitis, pneumonia, pleurisy, non-myocardial infarction cardiac arrest, chest pain, vertigo, headache, accelerated hypertension, kidney mass, bowel obstruction, bilirubin increase, cholangitis, progression of PSC, intervertebral discitis, rectal bleeding and post-biopsy bleeding. In our completed Phase 1 and Phase 1b clinical trials of NGM313, there were two reported serious adverse events in the NGM313 treatment arms: cholecystitis and rectal bleeding due to hemorrhoids, both of which were deemed by the investigators to be unrelated to treatment with NGM313. In our completed Phase 1 clinical trial of NGM120, there were two reported serious adverse events in the NGM120 treatment arms: renal colic and bipolar disorder, both of which were deemed by the investigators to be unrelated to treatment with NGM120.\nSignificant increases in serum levels of LDL cholesterol were observed in clinical trials of aldafermin in NASH and type 2 diabetes. The drug-induced changes in LDL cholesterol were brought back to baseline levels with concomitant statin use in NASH patients, however, sustained LDL cholesterol elevations in untreated patients can be associated with cardiovascular disease. While the impact of these drug-induced changes in cholesterol are unknown, we believe that concomitant statin use, along with aldafermin\u2019s triglyceride lowering and HDL cholesterol elevating properties, will provide an overall neutral to positive impact on patients\u2019 cardiovascular health. We have not observed any significant changes in LDL cholesterol with aldafermin in trials we have conducted in patients with cholestatic liver disease, such as PBC and PSC.\nOne subject in the aldafermin Phase 2 clinical trial in type 2 diabetes developed antibodies against aldafermin that appear to cross-react with FGF19. This patient did not demonstrate any biochemical or clinical safety concerns while in the study, and we have not identified any safety concerns while monitoring the subject following the study. Six of the 36 subjects in the aldafermin Phase 2 extension clinical trial in PBC were confirmed to have antibodies against aldafermin. These subjects have not demonstrated any biochemical or clinical safety signals that were different from observations in subjects that did not generate antibodies against aldafermin.\nHowever, future results of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects, anti-drug antibodies or unexpected characteristics. In such an event, we could suspend or terminate our trials or the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease clinical trials or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur most advanced clinical-stage product candidate, aldafermin, is a modified version of a human hormone that has been associated with liver cancer in rodent testing.\nAldafermin is a modified version of FGF19, a human hormone that has been associated with liver cancer in rodent testing. The IND that we filed in February 2014 for type 2 diabetes was placed on clinical hold by the FDA Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products pending receipt of additional information relating to the potential risk of proliferative effects of aldafermin in the livers of non-human primates and mice based on concerns relating to the observation that human FGF19 can induce hepatocellular proliferation in rodents. We withdrew this IND in January 2015, as we determined that we would not further study aldafermin in type 2 diabetes after we analyzed the results of the Phase 2 clinical trial of aldafermin in type 2 diabetes and made the determination to pursue NASH and other liver indications. To date, the FDA Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products, which is responsible for the NASH indication, has not requested any additional information regarding the potential for aldafermin to induce hepatocellular proliferation. We have received feedback from the FDA Carcinogenicity\nAssessment Committee that our preclinical data through six-month chronic toxicology studies in mice and monkeys support a single species, two-year carcinogenicity assessment in rats. The human hormone and the rodent ortholog for FGF19 share a sequence identity of approximately 50%, which means that the results of these studies of aldafermin in rats are not necessarily predictive of the potential risk of carcinogenicity in humans. To our knowledge, neither FGF19 nor any variant thereof other than aldafermin has ever been tested in humans. We believe we have identified a modified version of FGF19 that does not exhibit the cancer-causing effects of native human FGF19 in rodents. We believe that aldafermin will have a superior therapeutic profile to FGF19 based on preclinical data showing reduced fasting blood glucose levels, fed insulin levels and bile acid suppression in animals. However, we may be incorrect in these beliefs, and we cannot be sure that regulators will view our product candidate as safe or that physicians will view our product candidates as superior to alternative treatments. Concerns about the association between FGF19 and liver cancer could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop and commercialize aldafermin.\nWe have no experience in sales, marketing and distribution and may have to enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, which could prevent us from successfully commercializing our product candidates.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. To commercialize our product candidates outside of the Merck collaboration, or to commercialize products subject to the Merck collaboration for which we may in the future exercise our co-detailing rights in the United States, we must either develop our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which will be expensive and time consuming, or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us. If we exercise our co-detailing rights in the United States with respect to the Merck collaboration, we will be responsible for the costs of fielding such a sales force, subject to partial offset pursuant to the formula by which profits are allocated, and the risks of attracting, retaining, motivating and ensuring the compliance of such a sales force with the various requirements of the Merck collaboration and applicable law. If we decide to market any of our products on our own, we will have to commit significant resources to developing a marketing and sales force and supporting distribution capabilities. If we decide to enter into arrangements with third parties for performance of these services, we may find that they are not available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are not able to establish and maintain successful arrangements with third parties or build our own sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically and commercially promising or profitable product candidates.\nWe have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine which of our product candidates should proceed to initial clinical trials, later-stage clinical development and potential commercialization. We may make incorrect determinations in allocating resources among these product candidates. Our decisions to allocate our research and development, management and financial resources toward particular product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs, such as our decision to suspend activities with NGM386 while we focus on NGM395, may also be incorrect and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities.\nUnder our Collaboration Agreement with Merck, we have the right, exercisable during a specified period prior to the commencement of Phase 3 clinical testing of the applicable product candidate, to convert our economic participation from a milestones and net sales royalty arrangement into a cost and profit share arrangement. If we exercise the cost and profit share right, we have the ability to participate in a co-detailing relationship in the United States. Due to the limited exercise period, we may have to choose whether a product candidate will be subject to a cost and profit share arrangement before we have as much information as we would like, including whether and when such program may receive FDA approval of the applicable BLA. As a result of such incomplete information or due to incorrect analysis by us, we may select a cost and profit share program that later proves to have less commercial potential than an alternative, or none at all, or may pass on a cost and profit sharing program that proves commercially successful.\nWe must attract and retain highly skilled employees in order to succeed. If we are not able to retain our current senior management team, especially Dr. Jin-Long Chen, and our scientific advisors or continue to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and business personnel, our business will suffer.\nTo succeed, we must recruit, retain, manage and motivate qualified clinical, scientific, technical and management personnel and we face significant competition for experienced personnel. If we do not succeed in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly at the management level, it could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. We are dependent on the members of our management team and our scientific advisors for our business success. An important element of our strategy is to take advantage of the research and development expertise of our current management and to utilize the expertise of our scientific advisors in the cardio-metabolic, liver, oncologic and ophthalmic disease fields. We currently have employment letter agreements with all of our executive officers. Our employment agreements with our executive officers are terminable by them without notice and some provide for severance and change in control benefits. The loss of any one of our executive officers, including, in particular, Dr. Jin-Long Chen, our Chief Scientific Officer, or a key scientific consultant could result in a significant loss in the knowledge and experience that we, as an organization, possess and could cause significant delays, or outright failure, in the development and further commercialization of our product candidates.\nTo fully realize the research and development support committed under our collaboration with Merck, we will need to maintain a significant number of qualified research and development, scientific, administrative and commercial personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel, including management, in the technical fields in which we operate, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the successful research, development and commercialization of our product candidates. In particular, we have experienced a very competitive hiring environment in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we are headquartered. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success with which we can discover and develop product candidates and our business will be limited.\nDisputes under key agreements or conflicts of interest with our scientific advisors or clinical investigators could delay or prevent development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nAny agreements we have or may enter into with third parties, such as collaboration, license, supplier, manufacturing, sponsored research, CRO or clinical trial agreements, may give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. Disagreements could develop over contract interpretation, rights to ownership or use of intellectual property, the scope and direction of research and development, the approach for regulatory approvals or commercialization strategy. We intend to conduct research programs in a range of therapeutic areas, but our pursuit of these opportunities could result in conflicts with the other parties to these agreements that may be developing or selling pharmaceuticals or conducting other activities in these same therapeutic areas. Any disputes or commercial conflicts could lead to the termination of our agreements, delay progress of our product development programs, compromise our ability to renew agreements or obtain future agreements, lead to the loss of intellectual property rights, result in increased financial obligations for us or result in costly litigation.\nWe work with outside scientific advisors and collaborators at academic and other institutions that assist us in our research and development efforts. Our scientific advisors are not our employees and may have other commitments that limit their availability to us. If a conflict of interest between their work for us and their work for another entity arises, we may lose their services.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could adversely affect our operations.\nSince executing the Collaboration Agreement in 2015, we have significantly increased our headcount and advanced our pipeline and the complexity of our operations, which has placed a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. We expect this strain to continue as we maintain our growth and seek to obtain and manage relationships with third parties. Our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively depends upon the continual improvement of our procedures, reporting systems and operational, financial and management controls. We may not be able to expand or identify sufficiently-sized facilities to accommodate our growth, particularly given our location in South San Francisco, California and the current high demand for, and restricted supply of, research and development facilities in this market. We may not be able to implement administrative and operational improvements in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. If we do not meet these challenges, we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures, which in turn may slow our growth or give rise to inefficiencies that would increase our losses.\nWe may acquire additional assets, intellectual property and complementary businesses in the future. Acquisitions involve many risks, any of which could materially harm our business, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention from core business concerns, failure to effectively exploit acquired assets or intellectual property, failure to successfully integrate the acquired business or realize expected synergies or the loss of key employees from either our business or the acquired businesses.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. A number of pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Allergan, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boerhinger Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi and Takeda, as well as large and small biotechnology companies such as 89Bio, Akero, Albireo, Alentis, Amgen, Apellis, Ascletis, Axcella, Bird Rock, Can-Fite, Cirius, Enanta, Galectin, Galmed, Genfit, Gilead, Glympse, Immuron, Intercept, Inventiva, Iveric, Madrigal, MannKind, MediciNova, Metacrine, Mirum, Nalpropion, North Sea, Promethera, Salix, Scholar Rock, Seal Rock, Terns, Tiziana, Viking and Vivus, are pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases that are targeted by our most advanced product candidates. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of cardio-metabolic, liver, oncologic and ophthalmic diseases will increase. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for superior products or for other products that would compete with our product candidates. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels and commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Smaller and earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.\nOur competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than us or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nThere are no currently approved therapies for NASH. Although we believe there are no approved therapies that specifically target the signaling pathways that our current product candidates are designed to modulate or inhibit, there are numerous currently approved therapies for treating the same diseases or indications, other than NASH, for which our product candidates may be useful and many of these currently approved therapies act through mechanisms similar to our product candidates. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies or products and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products, including branded generic products. This may make it difficult for us to differentiate our products from currently approved therapies, which may adversely impact our business strategy. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.\nIf aldafermin or NGM313 were approved for the treatment of NASH, future competition could also arise from products currently in development, including: cenicriviroc, an immunomodulator that blocks CCR2 and CCR5, from Allergan; firsocostat, an ACC inhibitor, and cilofexor, an FXR agonist, both from Gilead; OCA, an FXR agonist, from Intercept; resmetirom, a beta-thyroid hormone receptor agonist, from Madrigal; pegbelfermin, PEGylated FGF21, from Bristol-Myers Squibb; AKR-001, an Fc conjugated FGF21, from Akero; elobixibat, an IBAT-inhibitor, from Albireo; a Galectin-3 inhibitor from Galectin; a synthetic conjugate of cholic acid and arachidic acid from Galmed; an FXR agonist from Metacrine; EDP-305, an FXR agonist, from Enanta; FXR agonists from Novartis; a beta-thyroid hormone receptor agonist from Viking; semaglutide, a GLP-1 analog, from Novo Nordisk; a mitochondrial pyruvate complex modulator from Cirius; and elafibranor, a PPAR alpha/delta agonist, from Genfit. The foregoing competitive risks apply to aldafermin, any variants of aldafermin, including the second-generation, half-life extended version of FGF19 we are currently developing, and NGM313.\nIf any of our product candidates were approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, these products would face competition from currently approved and marketed products, including: biguanides; sulfonylureas; TZDs; alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs); dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors; glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues; SGLT2 inhibitors; oral GLP-1 mimetics; and insulins, including injectable and inhaled versions. Further competition could arise from products currently in development, including: 11 beta HSD (Incyte, Japan Tobacco, Roche); and GPR40 (Connexios, Takeda). Some of these programs have advanced further in clinical development than our product candidates and could receive approval before our product candidates are approved, if they are approved at all.\nOur product candidates may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors, pharmaceutical companies and others in the medical community. Demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and obtaining regulatory approvals will not guarantee future revenue. Our commercial success also depends on coverage and adequate reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, which may be difficult or time-consuming to obtain, may be limited in scope and may not be obtained in all jurisdictions in which we may seek to market our products. Governments and private insurers closely examine medical products to determine whether they should be covered by reimbursement and, if so, the level of reimbursement that will apply. We cannot be certain that third-party payors will sufficiently reimburse sales of our products, or otherwise enable us to sell our products at profitable prices. Similar concerns could also limit the reimbursement amounts that health insurers or government agencies in other countries are prepared to pay for our products. In many regions, including Europe, Japan and Canada, where we may market our products, either directly or with collaborators, the pricing of prescription drugs is controlled by the government or regulatory agencies. Regulatory agencies in these countries could determine that the pricing for our products should be based on prices of other commercially available drugs for the same disease, rather than allowing us to market our products at a premium as new drugs. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of the product candidate, as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment by clinics and patients;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of the product candidate over alternative treatments, including any similar generic treatments;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;\n\u2022\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe frequency and severity of adverse events;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u2022\nunfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate.\nSales of medical products also depend on the willingness of physicians to prescribe the treatment, which is likely to be based on a determination by these physicians that the products are safe, therapeutically effective and cost effective. In addition, the inclusion or exclusion of products from treatment guidelines established by various physician groups and the viewpoints of influential physicians can affect the willingness of other physicians to prescribe the treatment. We cannot predict whether physicians, physicians\u2019 organizations, hospitals, other healthcare providers, government agencies or private insurers will determine that our products are safe, therapeutically effective and cost effective as compared with competing treatments. If any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by such parties, we may not generate or derive sufficient revenue from that product candidate and may not become or remain profitable.\nEven if we commercialize any of our product candidates, alone or with our partners, these products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay or limit our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenue we generate from the sale of the product in that particular country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. The HHS department is considering new regulations that would tie certain drug payments to an International Price Index comprised of prices for the same drugs in developed countries. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we or our partners commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement\nwill be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we or our partners obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we and our partners may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which marketing approval is obtained.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including costs of research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nThe advancement of healthcare reform may negatively impact our ability to profitably sell our product candidates, if approved.\nThird-party payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, in 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.\nIn addition, while Congress has not passed comprehensive legislation repealing the ACA, it has introduced legislation to modify certain provisions. Congress will likely consider other legislation to modify or replace additional elements of the ACA. It is unclear how these efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, or other appeals, will impact the ACA and our business.\nOther legislative changes that have affected or may affect our industry include the Budget Control Act of 2011 which has triggered automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year through 2027 unless Congress takes additional action. Recently, there has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, the Trump administration released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. We expect that the healthcare reform measures that have been adopted and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in\npayments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.\nOur international operations may expose us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, pricing and reimbursement risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally. Some of our suppliers and clinical trial sites are located outside of the United States. Furthermore, if we, Merck or any future collaborator succeeds in developing any of our product candidates, we intend to market them in the EU and other jurisdictions in addition to the United States. If approved, we, Merck or any future collaborator may hire sales representatives and conduct physician and patient association outreach activities outside of the United States. Doing business internationally involves a number of challenges and risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations, such as privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022\nfailure by us to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the use of our products in various countries;\n\u2022\nrejection or qualification of foreign clinical trial data by the competent authorities of other countries;\n\u2022\ndelays or interruptions in the supply of clinical trial materials resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad, including those that may result from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nadditional potentially relevant third-party patent rights;\n\u2022\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining, maintaining, protecting and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors or patient self-pay systems;\n\u2022\nlimits in our ability to penetrate international markets;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, including COVID-19 and related shelter-in-place orders, travel, social distancing and quarantine policies, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions;\n\u2022\ncertain expenses, including, among others, expenses for travel, translation and insurance; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to anti-corruption compliance and record-keeping that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its accounting provisions or its anti-bribery provisions or provisions of anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws in other countries.\nAny of these factors could harm our ongoing international clinical operations and supply chain, as well as any future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we or our collaborator commercializes any resulting products. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products that we may develop caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial subjects or patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nOur clinical trial liability insurance coverage may not adequately cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Our inability to obtain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or delay the commercialization of any products or product candidates that we develop. We intend to expand our insurance coverage for products to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. If we are sued for any injury caused by our products, product candidates or processes, our liability could exceed our product liability insurance coverage and our total assets. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or potential outcome, may also generate negative publicity or hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of our products or expand our business.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers, customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, if violated, could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we or our collaborator obtains marketing approval. Our arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our products for which we or our collaborator obtains marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce\nor reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing, or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchase, lease or order, of any good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal FCA imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal HIPAA imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the HITECH of 2009 and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the ACA and its implementing regulations, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the HHS information related to \u201cpayments or other transfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to the HHS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or pricing; and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, additional regulatory oversight, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, that person or entity may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist activity and other events beyond our control, which could harm our business.\nOur former facility was subject to electrical blackouts as a result of a shortage of available electrical power. Future blackouts, which may be implemented by the local electricity provider in the face of high winds and dry conditions, could disrupt the operations of our current facility. Our facility is located in a seismically active region. We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business and financial results from a major earthquake, fire, power loss, terrorist activity or other disasters and do not have a complete recovery plan for such disasters. In addition, we do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us could harm our business. The contract manufacturing organization (\u201cCMO\u201d) that is the sole supplier of clinical drug substance of NGM313, NGM120, NGM217, NGM621 and NGM395 is located in a region that has experienced recent political unrest.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, in regions where we or third parties on which we rely have significant manufacturing facilities, concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations. The COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our operations, including at our headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is currently subject to a shelter-in-place order, and at our clinical trial sites, as well as the business or operations of our manufacturers, CROs or other third parties with whom we conduct business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where we have concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations, and could cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers and CROs upon whom we rely. For example, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread to multiple countries, including the United States and several European countries. Our headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and our contract manufacturer for aldafermin, Lonza, is located in Switzerland. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the U.S. government imposed travel restrictions on travel between the United States, Europe and certain other countries. Further, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency, invoking powers under the Stafford Act, the legislation that directs federal emergency disaster response. Similarly, the State of California declared a state of emergency related to the spread of COVID-19, and the San Francisco Department of Public Health announced aggressive recommendations to reduce the spread of the disease. On March 16, 2020, the health officers of six San Francisco Bay Area counties, including San Mateo County where our headquarters are located, issued shelter-in-place orders, which (i) direct all individuals living in those counties to shelter at their places of residence (subject to limited exceptions), (ii) direct all businesses and governmental agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations in those counties, (iii) prohibit all non-essential gatherings of any number of individuals, and (iv) order cessation of all non-essential travel. The shelter-in-place orders took effect on March 17, 2020 and will continue until April 7, 2020, unless further extended. In addition, we have implemented work-from-home policies for certain employees. The effects of the shelter-in-place order and our work-from-home policies may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which would disrupt our supply chain. In particular, some of our suppliers of certain materials used in the production of our drug products are located in Europe. For example, any manufacturing supply interruption of aldafermin, which is currently manufactured by Lonza at facilities in Switzerland, or our other product candidates, which are currently manufactured at a facility in Lithuania, could adversely affect our ability to conduct ongoing and future clinical trials of aldafermin and our other product candidates.\nIn addition, our clinical trials may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt\nhealthcare services. Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 and adversely impact our clinical trial operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nOur internal computer systems, or those used by our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nSimilar to other companies in our industry, we face substantial cybersecurity risk. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and future CROs and other contractors, collaborators and consultants may fail and are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. While we have not, to our knowledge, experienced any such material system failure or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates, to analyze clinical trial samples and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. In 2017, a security breach of the internal computer systems of our collaborator, Merck, caused material damage to its operations, but did not affect our internal operations. In June 2019, a vendor that conducted bioanalytical services for some of our aldafermin clinical trials was affected by a ransomware attack that resulted in a significant disruption to its IT systems. This cybersecurity incident at our vendor did not result in an integrity loss of certain clinical sample data for aldafermin, as verified by independent vendors. However, to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material costs, be exposed to liability, our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be hindered or delayed.\nEuropean data collection is governed by restrictive regulations governing the collection, use, processing and cross-border transfer of personal information.\nWe may collect, process, use or transfer personal information from individuals located in the EU in connection with our business, including in connection with conducting clinical trials in the EU. Additionally, if any of our product candidates are approved, we may seek to commercialize those products in the EU. The collection and use of personal health data in the EU are governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (\u201cGDPR\u201d). This legislation imposes requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal information relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside of the European Economic Area, including to the United States, providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal information, keeping personal information secure, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal information, responding to individuals\u2019 requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal information, reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, appointing data protection officers, conducting data protection impact assessments and record-keeping. The GDPR imposes additional responsibilities and liabilities in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and related national data protection laws of the member states of the EU may result in substantial fines, other administrative\npenalties and civil claims being brought against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use and generate materials that may expose us to material liability.\nOur research programs involve the use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to foreign, federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the use, manufacture, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We may incur significant costs to comply with these current or future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from hazardous materials and may incur material liability as a result of such contamination or injury. In the event of an accident, an injured party may seek to hold us liable for any damages that result. Any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our workers\u2019 compensation, property and business interruption insurance and we may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, if at all. We currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Merck and Other Third Parties\nWe depend on our collaboration with Merck and may depend in the future on collaborations with additional third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nIn February 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Merck focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of biologics, including NGM313, NGM120, NGM217, NGM621, NGM395 and NGM386, but excluding aldafermin. In November 2018, Merck exercised its option to license NGM313. In March 2019, Merck exercised its option to extend the collaboration for an additional two years, from March 17, 2020 through March 16, 2022. The collaboration involves a complex allocation of rights, provides for substantial research and development support, provides for additional payments upon Merck\u2019s election to further extend the term of the research program and provides us with either milestone payments based on the achievement of specified clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestones and royalty-based revenue if certain product candidates are successfully commercialized or a cost and profit sharing arrangement with the possibility that we would provide sales representatives to co-detail the product candidates that Merck elects to advance in the United States. We cannot predict the success of the collaboration, including whether Merck exercises its option to license additional product candidates or terminates its license to a program. Merck\u2019s license to the GDF15 receptor agonist program, including NGM395 and NGM386, was terminated effective May 31, 2019.\nWe may seek other third-party collaborators for the development and commercialization of any product candidates that are not subject to the Merck collaboration, including aldafermin, NGM395 and NGM386. Our likely collaborators for any collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. If we enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates, including our collaboration with Merck, pose risks to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nCollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. For example, under our collaboration with Merck, once proof-of-concept data in humans has been generated and Merck has exercised its option to acquire an exclusive license for a product candidate, our ability to influence the resources Merck devotes to such product candidate will be substantially reduced until such time, if any, that we exercise our right to participate in a cost and profit sharing arrangement. Even after we exercise that right to participate in a cost and profit sharing arrangement, our ability to influence Merck will be limited.\n\u2022\nCollaborators might opt not to pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding or external factors, such as an\nacquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities. For example, Merck might opt not to exercise its option to acquire a license to a product candidate that has generated proof-of-concept data, or Merck may opt to terminate its license to a program, as it did for NGM395 and NGM386.\n\u2022\nCollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing. For example, under our agreement with Merck, it is possible for Merck to terminate the NGM313 program and any other program (whether or not we have exercised our cost and profit sharing option) upon prior written notice, without triggering a termination of the remainder of the collaboration arrangement.\n\u2022\nCollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our medicines or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours.\n\u2022\nA collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more medicines might not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our product candidates.\n\u2022\nCollaborators might not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation. For example, Merck has the first right to maintain or defend our intellectual property rights under the Collaboration Agreement with respect to certain licensed programs and, although we may have the right to assume the maintenance and defense of our intellectual property rights if Merck does not, our ability to do so may be compromised by Merck\u2019s actions.\n\u2022\nDisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our medicines or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources.\n\u2022\nWe may lose certain valuable rights under circumstances identified in our collaborations, including, in the case of our agreement with Merck, if we undergo a change in control.\n\u2022\nCollaborations might be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\n\u2022\nCollaboration agreements might not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program under such collaboration could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nUnder certain circumstances, Merck may unilaterally terminate its annual funding of our research and development program, or terminate or shift the focus of its research and development funding, any of which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nUnder the Collaboration Agreement, Merck has the right to terminate all or part of the agreement at certain times and under certain circumstances. Merck may terminate the research and early development program effective March 17, 2022 by providing notice to us prior to March 17, 2021. Merck may terminate its annual funding of the research program prior to March 17, 2022 if we are acquired by a third party or if we are in material uncured breach of our obligations under the research and early development program. After the current term of the collaboration or, if Merck again exercises its option to extend the term, after such extension period, Merck may terminate the overall agreement for convenience upon written notice and subject to certain limitations.\nSubject to certain limitations, Merck may partially terminate the Collaboration Agreement for convenience as it relates to NGM313 or any future Optioned Program. For example, Merck terminated its license to our GDF15 receptor agonist program, including NGM395 and NGM386, effective May 31, 2019. Merck may also terminate the agreement as it relates to its rights to research and develop small molecule compounds. It may also terminate\nthe agreement with respect to a specific Optioned Program, such as NGM313, in the event of an uncured material breach by us. If Merck terminates a program as a result of our uncured material breach, then we would lose our option to participate in global cost and profit sharing if not yet exercised as of the time of termination, and lose our co-detailing option (whether or not exercised as of that time) for the relevant Optioned Program.\nIf Merck terminates funding, terminates the Collaboration Agreement, decides not to further extend the research phase of the collaboration or shifts the focus of its research and development funding, it could impede our ability to fund and complete our research and development programs, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain and maintain the third-party relationships that are necessary to develop, commercialize and manufacture some or all of our product candidates.\nIn addition to our dependence on our collaboration with Merck, we expect to depend on other collaborators, partners, licensees, CROs, clinical investigators, manufacturers and other third parties to support our discovery efforts, to formulate product candidates, to conduct clinical trials for some or all of our product candidates, to manufacture clinical and commercial scale quantities of our drug substances and drug products and to market, sell and distribute any products we successfully develop and for which we obtain regulatory approval. Any problems we experience with any of these third parties could delay our research efforts or the development, commercialization and manufacturing of our products or product candidates, which could harm our results of operations.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates or products ourselves, including reliance on third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by third parties because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to manufacture our product candidates or any products we may eventually commercialize in accordance with our specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of agreements by third parties, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for commercial sale, we or our collaborator may need to manufacture it in larger quantities. We intend to use third-party manufacturers for commercial quantities of aldafermin, NGM120, NGM217, NGM621 and NGM395, to the extent we advance these product candidates, and will rely on Merck to determine whether to utilize a third-party manufacturer or internal manufacturing capacity for NGM313 and other optioned product candidates. Our or our collaborator\u2019s manufacturers may not be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or efficient manner, or at all. If we or our collaborator are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate may be delayed or there may be a shortage in the supply of the product candidate. Our or our collaborator\u2019s failure or the failure of third-party manufacturers to comply with the FDA\u2019s cGMP and to pass inspections of the manufacturing facilities by the FDA or other regulatory agencies could seriously harm our business.\nWe cannot guarantee that we or, as applicable, our collaborator will be able to successfully negotiate agreements for, or maintain relationships with, collaborators, partners, licensees, CROs, clinical investigators, manufacturers and other third parties on favorable terms, if at all. If we or our collaborator are unable to obtain or maintain these agreements, we may not be able to clinically develop, formulate, manufacture, obtain regulatory approvals for or commercialize our product candidates, which will, in turn, adversely affect our business.\nWe and our collaborator expect to expend substantial management time and effort to enter into relationships with third parties and, if we or our collaborator successfully enter into such relationships, to manage these relationships. In addition, substantial capital will be paid to third parties in these relationships. However, we cannot control the amount or timing of resources our contract partners will devote to our research and development programs, product candidates or potential product candidates, and we cannot guarantee that these parties will fulfill their obligations to us under these arrangements in a timely fashion, if at all. In addition, we are less knowledgeable about the reputation and quality of third-party contractors in countries outside of the United States where we conduct discovery research or preclinical and clinical development and manufacturing of our product candidates and, therefore, enter into these relationships with less information than if these third parties were in the United States, we may not choose the best parties for these relationships.\nWe may seek to establish additional collaborations, and, if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur drug development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For product candidates not partnered with Merck, such as aldafermin, NGM395 and NGM386, we may decide to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for their development and potential commercialization.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products and the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of intellectual property, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. Potential collaborators may also consider alternative product candidates or intellectual property for similar indications that may be available for collaboration and whether such an alternative collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate.\nWe may also be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. For example, under our Collaboration Agreement with Merck, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize, except pursuant to the agreement, any medicine or product candidate that modulates a target then subject to the collaboration with specified activity. The FGF19 program, including aldafermin, is excluded from this provision, notwithstanding that both aldafermin and NGM313 signal, in part, through the FGFR1c pathway. During the tail period following the research term, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop or commercialize, outside of the collaboration, any medicine or product candidate with specified activity against any collaboration target that has been designated a tail target.\nCollaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and some aspects of our research and preclinical testing, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials, research or testing.\nWe currently rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, consultants and clinical investigators, to conduct our clinical trials and certain aspects of our research and preclinical testing. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities and such alternative arrangements may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities, but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as cGCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored\ndatabase, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nFurthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our medicines.\nWe also expect to rely on third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our medicines, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nIn addition, we rely on these third parties to provide accurate financial information related to our research and development activities and if any inaccurate financial information were provided by these third parties, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical testing and expect to continue to do so for clinical trials and for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or that such supply will not be available to us at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and for commercial supply of any of these product candidates for which we or our collaborator obtains marketing approval. To date, we have obtained materials for aldafermin, NGM313, NGM120, NGM217, NGM621 and NGM395 for preclinical and clinical testing from third-party manufacturers. Other than for a long-term supply agreement with Lonza for aldafermin, we do not have a long-term supply agreement with any third-party manufacturer.\nWe may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us; and\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance, quality assurance and safety and pharmacovigilance reporting.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP, regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or medicines, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our medicines and harm our business and results of operations.\nAny medicines that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply for bulk drug substances. If any one of our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace that manufacturer. Although we believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers who\ncould manufacture our product candidates, we would incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or any future products may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approvals\nNone of our product candidates has received regulatory approvals. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe do not expect our product candidates to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Our product candidates are subject to strict regulation by regulatory authorities in the United States and in other countries. We cannot market any product candidate until we have completed all necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and have obtained the necessary regulatory approvals. We do not know whether regulatory agencies will grant approval for any of our product candidates. Even if we complete preclinical studies and clinical trials successfully, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals or we may not receive approvals to make claims about our products that we believe to be necessary to effectively market our products. Data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials is subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval, and failure to comply with regulatory requirements or inadequate manufacturing processes are examples of other problems that could prevent approval. In addition, we may encounter delays or rejections due to additional government regulation from future legislation, administrative action or changes in the policies of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Even if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves a product, the approval will be limited to those indications covered in the approval.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable. Our inability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates would substantially harm our business.\nCurrently, none of our product candidates has received regulatory approval. The time required to obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of preclinical and clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s development and may vary among jurisdictions. It is possible that none of our existing or future product candidates will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndisagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfailure to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u2022\nfailure of results of clinical trials to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u2022\nfailure to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\ndisagreement with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe insufficiency of data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates to support the submission and filing of a BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain approval of the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u2022\nchanges in the approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data, to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the development program for other reasons. If we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate.\nWe have received orphan drug status for aldafermin for PBC in the United States and for PBC and PSC in the EU. The FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States and fewer than five in 10,000 individuals in the EU. Typically, if a drug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA, from approving another marketing application for the same drug for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and 10 years in the EU. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nAlthough we have obtained orphan drug status for aldafermin for PBC and PSC, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior, in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Any inability to secure orphan drug designation or the exclusivity benefits of this designation could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Obtaining orphan drug designation may not provide us with a material commercial advantage.\nThe FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. Fast Track designation does not change the standards for product approval.\nAlthough aldafermin has received Fast Track designation from the FDA for PBC and NASH, we may not necessarily experience faster development timelines or achieve faster review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. Access to an expedited program may also be withdrawn by the FDA if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Additionally, qualification for any expedited review procedure does not ensure that we will ultimately obtain regulatory approval for aldafermin or any other product candidate that we are developing or may develop.\nOur failure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our product candidates outside the United States.\nIf we or our collaborators succeed in developing any products, we intend to market them in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions in addition to the United States. In order to market and sell our products in other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, we must secure product reimbursement approvals before regulatory authorities will approve the product for sale in that country. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. Further, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not ensure approval in any other country, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Also, regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be withdrawn if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, if problems occur after the product candidate reaches the market or for other reasons. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and fail to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed and our business will be adversely affected. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. Approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. If we fail to obtain approval of any of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in another country, we will be unable to commercialize our product in that country, and the commercial prospects of that product candidate and our business prospects could decline.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtained regulatory approval for a product candidate, it would be subject to ongoing requirements by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities will continue to closely monitor the safety profile of any product even after approval. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of any of our product candidates, they may require labeling changes or establishment of a REMS or similar strategy, impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations and standards. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or undesirable side effects caused by such products are identified, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nissue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings about such product;\n\u2022\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022\nrequire that we conduct post-marketing studies;\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend marketing of, withdraw regulatory approval of or recall such product;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nAdvertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, DOJ, HHS\u2019 Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. Violations, including promotion of our products for unapproved (or off-label) uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations and civil and criminal sanctions by the government. Additionally, comparable foreign regulatory authorities will heavily scrutinize advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the United States.\nIn the United States, engaging in the impermissible promotion of our products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal FCA, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in any fines or settlement funds. Since 2004, these FCA lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements regarding certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses involving fines in excess of $1 billion. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, we may become subject to such litigation and, if we do not successfully defend against such actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates, if they exhibit harmful side effects after approval, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted, and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for aldafermin or any of our other product candidates, we will have tested them in only a small number of patients during our clinical trials. If our applications for marketing are approved and more patients begin to use our product, new risks and side effects associated with our products may be discovered. As a result, regulatory authorities may revoke their approvals. If aldafermin is approved by the FDA based on a surrogate endpoint pursuant to accelerated approval regulations (Subpart E regulations), we will be required to conduct additional clinical trials establishing clinical benefit on the ultimate outcome of NASH. Additionally, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in labeling of our product, reformulate our product or make changes and obtain new approvals for our and our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities for aldafermin and our other product candidates. We might have to withdraw or recall our products from the marketplace. We may also experience a significant drop in the potential sales of our product if and when regulatory approvals for such product are obtained, experience harm to our reputation in the marketplace or become subject to lawsuits, including class actions. Any of these results could decrease or prevent any sales of our approved product or substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our product.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technologies.\nOur success will depend in significant part on our and our current or future licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 ability to establish and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property covering the product candidates we plan to develop, and the ability to develop these product candidates and commercialize the products resulting therefrom, without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. In addition to taking other steps to protect our intellectual property, we have applied for, and intend to continue to apply for, patents with claims covering our technologies, processes and product candidates when and where we deem it appropriate to do so. We have filed numerous patent applications both in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions to obtain patent rights to inventions we have discovered, with claims directed to compositions of matter, methods of use, formulations, combination therapy and other technologies relating to our product candidates. There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will issue as patents or, for those applications that do mature into patents, whether the claims of the patents will exclude others from making, using or selling our product candidates or products that are substantially similar to our product candidates. In countries where we have not and do not seek patent protection, third parties may be able to manufacture and sell our product candidates without our permission, and we may not be able to stop them from doing so.\nPublications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not at all until they are issued as a patent. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nAny changes we make to our product candidates, including aldafermin, NGM313, NGM120, NGM217, NGM621 and NGM395, to cause them to have what we view as more advantageous properties may not be covered by our existing patents and patent applications, and we may be required to file new patent applications and/or seek other forms of protection for any such altered product candidates. The patent landscape surrounding the technology underlying our product candidates is crowded, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure patent protection that would adequately cover an alternative to our aldafermin molecule, including half-life extending formulation enhancements or the half-life extended variants of FGF19 that we are developing, NGM313, NGM120, NGM217, NGM621 and NGM395 or any of our other product candidates.\nWe do not currently own or have a license to any issued patents that cover our NGM217 or NGM621 product candidates, although they are disclosed and claimed in our pending U.S. non-provisional and/or PCT applications and/or national stage applications in particular foreign countries. The patent landscape surrounding NGM217 and NGM621 is crowded, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure patent protection that would adequately cover such product candidates, nor can there be any assurance that we would obtain sufficiently broad claims to be able to prevent others from selling competing products.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we and our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection for them. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties and may be reliant on our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators to perform these activities, which means that these patent applications may not be prosecuted, and these patents may not be enforced, in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators fail to establish, maintain, protect or enforce such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised.\nSimilar to other biotechnology companies, our patent position is generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. In recent years, these areas have been the subject of much litigation in the industry. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our current or future licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our current or future licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or product candidates, or products resulting therefrom, in whole or in part, or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. The patent examination process may require us or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators to narrow the scope of the claims of pending and future patent applications, which would limit the scope of patent protection that is obtained, if any. Our and our current or future licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology that is currently claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications, and then only to the extent the claims that issue are broad enough to cover the technology being practiced by third parties.\nFurthermore, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after the resulting products are commercialized. As a result, our owned and in-licensed patents may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours and we may need to rely solely on regulatory or similar protections, if they are available. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms for our issued patents, where available. In the United States, this includes under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the original expiration date of the patent as compensation for regulatory delays. However, such a patent term extension cannot lengthen the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product\u2019s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. During the period of patent term extension, the claims of a patent are not enforceable for their full scope, but are instead limited to the scope of the approved product. In addition, the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. In addition, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to the expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. If this occurs, any period during which we have the right to exclusively market our product will be shorter than we would otherwise expect, and our competitors may obtain approval of and launch products earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe legal protection afforded to inventors and owners of intellectual property in countries outside of the United States may not be as broad or effective as that in the United States and we may, therefore, be unable to acquire and enforce intellectual property rights outside the United States to the same extent as in the United States. Whether filed in the United States or abroad, our patent applications may be challenged or may fail to result in issued patents.\nIn addition, our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing or commercializing competing products. Furthermore, others may independently develop or commercialize similar or alternative technologies or drugs, or design around our patents. Our patents may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or narrowed, or fail to provide us with any competitive advantages. In many foreign countries, patent applications and/or issued patents, or parts thereof, must be translated into the native language. If our patent applications or issued patents are translated incorrectly, they may not adequately cover our technologies; in some countries, it may not be possible to rectify an incorrect translation, which may result in patent protection that does not adequately cover our technologies in those countries.\nFiling, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States are less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and certain state laws in the United States. Consequently, we and our collaborator may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our and our collaborator\u2019s inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our and our collaborator\u2019s inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our and our collaborator\u2019s technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we and our collaborator have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and our and our collaborator\u2019s patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals. This could make it difficult for us and our collaborator to stop the infringement of our and our collaborator\u2019s patents or the marketing of competing products in violation of our and our collaborator\u2019s proprietary rights, generally. Proceedings to enforce our and our collaborator\u2019s patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our and our collaborator\u2019s efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our and our collaborator\u2019s patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could place our and our collaborator\u2019s patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our collaborator. We or our collaborator may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our collaborator initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nThe requirements for patentability differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. For example, China has a heightened requirement for patentability and, specifically, requires a detailed description of medical uses of a claimed drug. In addition, India, certain countries in Europe and certain developing countries, including Thailand, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our collaborator may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our collaborator are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. Accordingly, our and our collaborator\u2019s efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance and annuity fees on issued United States patents and most foreign patent applications and patents must be paid to the USPTO, and foreign patent agencies, respectively, in order to maintain such patents and patent applications. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application, examination and issuance processes. While an inadvertent lapse can be cured, in some cases, by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our collaborator fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or technologies, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property rights, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves technological and legal complexity, and obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. The U.S. Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances, weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations or ruling that certain subject matter is not eligible for patent protection. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our and our collaborator\u2019s ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained. Depending on decisions by Congress, the federal courts, the USPTO and equivalent bodies in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our and our collaborator\u2019s ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents and patents we and our collaborator may obtain in the future.\nPatent reform laws, such as the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d), and changes in how patent laws are interpreted could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our and our collaborator\u2019s patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our collaborator\u2019s issued patents. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the filing and prosecution strategies associated with patent applications, including a change from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d to a \u201cfirst-inventor-to-file\u201d patent system. Other provisions also may affect patent prosecution and litigation, such as by allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO-administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review and derivation proceedings. The USPTO has developed regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act and, in particular, the \u201cfirst-inventor-to-file\u201d provisions, became effective in 2013. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our or our collaborator\u2019s patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our collaborator\u2019s issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain intellectual property rights or technologies necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nSeveral third parties are actively researching and seeking and obtaining patent protection in the cardio-metabolic disease, NASH, liver disease, oncology and ophthalmic fields, and there are issued third-party patents and published third-party patent applications in these fields. The patent landscape around our aldafermin, NGM313, NGM120, NGM217, NGM621 and NGM395 product candidates is complex, and we are aware of several third-party patents and patent applications containing claims directed to compositions of matter, methods of use and related subject matter, some of which pertain, at least in part, to subject matter that might be relevant to our aldafermin, NGM313, NGM120, NGM217, NGM621 and NGM395 product candidates. However, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates and technologies.\nDepending on what patent claims ultimately issue and how courts construe the issued patent claims, as well as depending on the ultimate formulation and method of use of our product candidates, we may need to obtain a license to practice the technology claimed in such patents. There can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If a third party does not offer us a necessary license or offers a license only on terms that are unattractive or unacceptable to us, we might be unable to develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, even if we obtain licenses to such intellectual property, but subsequently fail to meet our obligations under our license agreements, or such license agreements are terminated for any other reason, we may lose our rights to in-licensed technologies.\nThe licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment, or at all. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant program or product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nThird parties may infringe our or our collaborator\u2019s patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our or our collaborator\u2019s intellectual property rights. In the future, we or our collaborator may initiate legal proceedings to enforce or defend our or our collaborator\u2019s intellectual property rights, to protect our or our collaborator\u2019s trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own or control. Also, third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us or our collaborator to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own, control or to which we have rights. For example, generic or biosimilar drug manufacturers or other competitors or third parties may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our collaborator\u2019s patents, requiring us or our collaborator to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. These proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming and many of our or our collaborator\u2019s adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we or our collaborator can. Accordingly, despite our or our collaborator\u2019s efforts, we or our collaborator may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating intellectual property rights we own, control or have rights to, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, if we or our collaborator initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering a product candidate, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during\nprosecution. In an infringement or declaratory judgment proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our or our collaborator\u2019s patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our or our collaborator\u2019s patents at risk of being invalidated, narrowed, held unenforceable or interpreted in such a manner that would not preclude third parties from entering the market with competing products.\nThird-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, inter partes review or interference proceedings, or other pre-issuance or post-grant proceedings, as well as other patent office proceedings or litigation in the United States or other jurisdictions provoked by third parties or brought by us or our collaborator, may be necessary to determine the inventorship, priority, patentability or validity of inventions with respect to our or our collaborator\u2019s patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could leave our technology or product candidates without patent protection, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or could require us or our collaborator to obtain license rights from the prevailing party in order to be able to manufacture or commercialize our product candidates without infringing third-party patent rights. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us or our collaborator a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborator obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us or our collaborator. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our or our collaborator\u2019s patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Even if we successfully defend such litigation or proceeding, we may incur substantial costs and it may distract our management and other employees.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, many foreign jurisdictions have rules of discovery that are different than those in the United States and that may make defending or enforcing our or our collaborator\u2019s patents extremely difficult. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights or we may initiate legal proceedings against third parties to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights controlled by third parties, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborator to develop, manufacture, market and sell any product candidates that we may develop and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us or our collaborator alleging that we or our collaborator infringe their intellectual property rights or we or our collaborator may initiate legal proceedings against third parties to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights controlled by third parties, including in oppositions, interferences, revocations, reexaminations, inter partes review or derivation proceedings before the USPTO or its counterparts in other jurisdictions. These proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming and many of our or our collaborator\u2019s adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we or our collaborator can.\nFor example, through our European representative, we filed an opposition in the EPO, to a patent granted to St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital Sydney Limited (\u201cSt. Vincent\u2019s\u201d) claiming the use of MIC-1, also known as GDF15, in the treatment of obesity. In the first instance proceedings, the Opposition Division at the EPO upheld the patent as granted. We have appealed this decision to the Board of Appeals at the EPO and oral proceedings in that appeal are scheduled for August 2020. The St. Vincent\u2019s patent as granted is currently scheduled to expire in April 2025. Should the patent be upheld on appeal or should we decide not to pursue the appeal, we do not believe that NGM395 would be able to be commercially launched until after expiration of the patent.\nWe filed an opposition in the EPO to a patent granted to Amgen claiming the use of GDF15 polypeptides for the treatment of several metabolic disorders. At the first instance proceedings, the Opposition Division at the EPO maintained the patent in amended form, with claims not including obesity, an indication for which we may pursue a regulatory approval for NGM395. We appealed the decision to maintain the patent to the Board of Appeals at the EPO in September 2019. The Amgen patent as granted is currently scheduled to expire in April 2032. If these patents have not expired, or are not ultimately deemed invalid in appeals stemming from the opposition proceedings, and/or our non-infringement positions are not upheld, and these patents are successfully asserted against us in a European country court proceeding after any future potential approval of our NGM395 product candidate for the treatment of obesity in Europe, then we may be required to obtain licenses to such patents in order to commercialize NGM395, and there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIn November 2018, we filed an opposition in the EPO to a patent granted to Genentech claiming the use of an anti-KLB agonistic antibody for treating diabetes mellitus or insulin resistance. We are one of two opponents challenging the Genentech patent as granted on numerous grounds, including lack of novelty and inventive step, insufficiency and claiming subject matter that extends beyond the application as originally filed. Genentech filed its response to opposition in April 2019, and the Company filed a response to the Genentech submission in June 2019 and oral proceedings were held in February 2020. The Genentech patent is currently scheduled to expire in April 2028. If the Genentech patent is not invalidated in the opposition proceedings and appeals, has not expired and/or our non-infringement positions are not upheld, and this patent is successfully asserted against us or our collaborator in a European country court proceeding after any future potential approval of our NGM313 product candidate for the treatment of diabetes and/or NASH in Europe, then we and/or our collaborator may be required to obtain a license to this patent in order to commercialize our NGM313 product candidate, and there can be no assurance that such license would be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAn unfavorable outcome in any such proceeding could require us or our collaborator to cease using the related technology or developing or commercializing our product candidates, or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business.\nWe perform searches of patent and scientific databases in order to identify documents that may be of potential relevance to the freedom-to-operate and/or patentability of our product candidates. In general, such searches are conducted based on keywords, sequences, inventors/authors and assignees/entities to capture U.S. and European patents and patent applications, PCT publications and scientific journal articles. There can be no assurance that such searches will identify all potentially relevant patents or patent applications, and the failure to identify any such patents or patent applications could have a material adverse effect on the commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe are aware of several third-party patents and patent applications containing claims directed to compositions of matter, methods of use and related subject matter, some of which pertain, at least in part, to subject matter that might be relevant to our aldafermin, NGM313, NGM120, NGM217, NGM621 and NGM395 product candidates. We are not aware of any facts that would lead us to conclude that the valid and enforceable claims of any third-party patents would reasonably be interpreted to encompass our product candidates, unless we are unsuccessful in our opposition of any of the granted European patents that are discussed above, or any appeals stemming therefrom. As to pending third-party applications, we cannot predict with any certainty which claims will issue, if any, or the scope of such issued claims. Even if we believe third-party intellectual property claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity, enforceability or priority. A court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, which could materially and adversely affect our ability and the ability of our collaborator to commercialize any product candidates we may develop and any other product candidates or technologies covered by the asserted third-party patents. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. If any such third-party patents (including those that may issue from such applications) were successfully asserted against us or our\ncollaborator or other commercialization partners and we were unable to successfully challenge the validity or enforceability of any such asserted patents, then we or our collaborator and other commercialization partners may be prevented from commercializing our product candidates, or may be required to pay significant damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to willfully infringe the asserted patents, or obtain a license to such patents, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. Any of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated a third party\u2019s intellectual property or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at universities or at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Most of these employees executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed confidential information or intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer, or that third parties have an interest in our patents as an inventor or co-inventor. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain other damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we successfully prosecute or defend against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distract management.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we or our licensors may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or our or our licensors\u2019 ownership of our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our product candidates. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we breach any license agreement related to our product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our licensors and collaborator, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our and our collaborator\u2019s proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. A third party may hold intellectual property rights, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development of our products. As a result, we are a party to a number of technology licenses that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. If we fail to comply with the obligations under these agreements, including payment and diligence obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we may not be able to develop, manufacture, market or sell any product that is covered by these agreements or to engage in any other activities necessary to our business that require the freedom-to-operate afforded by the agreements, or we may face other penalties under the agreements. For example, we are party to license agreements with multiple vendors under which we license cell lines used to produce multiple product candidates, including some that are currently subject to our collaboration with Merck. We require prior consent from some of these vendors to grant sub-licenses under these agreements. Therefore, these vendors may be able to prevent us from granting sub-licenses to third parties, which could affect our ability or Merck\u2019s ability to use certain desired manufacturers in order to manufacture our product candidates.\nAny of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under any such agreement. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or amended agreements, which may not be available to us on equally favorable terms, or at all, or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to intellectual property or technology important to our development programs.\nOur inability to protect our confidential information and trade secrets would harm our business and competitive position.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely substantially on trade secrets in our activities, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary materials and information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. However, these steps may be inadequate, we may fail to enter into agreements with all such parties or any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information and there may be no adequate remedy available for such breach of an agreement. We cannot assure you that our proprietary information will not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts both within and outside the United States may be less willing, or unwilling, to protect trade secrets. If a competitor lawfully obtained or independently developed any of our trade secrets, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make products that are similar to any product candidates we may develop or utilize similar technologies that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we license or may own in the future;\n\u2022\nwe, or our current or future collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents and pending patent applications that we license or may own in the future;\n\u2022\nwe, or our current or future collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or their inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our owned or licensed intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications or those that we may own in the future will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022\nissued patents to which we hold rights may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may harm our business; and\n\u2022\nwe may choose not to file a patent application in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\nShould any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly from time to time, for example, varying between a high of $20.50 on December 18, 2019 and a low of $8.81 on October 7, 2019. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which we cannot control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, these factors include:\n\u2022\ndevelopments associated with our collaboration with Merck, including any non-renewal, termination or other change in our relationship with Merck;\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions with respect to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 product candidates or products;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors or collaborators of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nregulatory, legal or payor developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or products;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Select Market and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies, including very recently in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in decreased stock prices for many companies notwithstanding the lack of a fundamental change in their underlying business models or prospects. Broad market and industry factors, including potentially worsening economic conditions and other adverse effects or developments relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nBecause of potential volatility in our trading price and trading volume, we may incur significant costs from class action securities litigation.\nHolders of stock in companies that have a volatile stock price frequently bring securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. If any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit of this type against us, even if the lawsuit is without merit, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the time and attention of our management could be diverted from other business concerns, either of which could seriously harm our business.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cNGM\u201d and trades on that market. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock when desired, or the prices that you may obtain for your shares.\nOur principal stockholders, including entities affiliated with The Column Group, Merck and management, own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, significant stockholders, including The Column Group and Merck, and their respective affiliates beneficially own a significant amount of our voting stock. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders. In addition, if any of our significant stockholders decide to sell a meaningful amount of their ownership position and there is not sufficient demand in the market for such stocks, our stock price could fall.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFor so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including:\n\u2022\nthe provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nthe \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and some of the disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of our chief executive officer; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement to provide detailed compensation discussion and analysis in proxy statements and reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation.\nWe may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years. We will cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest of: (1) December 31, 2024; (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more; (3) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act.\nWith respect to the JOBS Act, we are taking advantage of some, but not all, of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we are not subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d. As a result, changes in rules of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d which may increase the risk that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies\nin our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline. In addition, if we lose our \u201cemerging growth company\u201d status sooner than anticipated, we may incur additional costs to comply with rules and regulations required for public companies, which may impact our financial position and results of operations.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse and unexpected revenue fluctuations and adversely affect our reported results of operations.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse, unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported financial position or results of operations. Financial accounting standards in the United States are constantly under review and new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred frequently in the past and are expected to occur again in the future. As a result, we may be required to make changes in our accounting policies. Those changes could affect our financial condition and results of operations or the way in which such financial condition and results of operations are reported. Compliance with new accounting standards may also result in additional expenses. As a result, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from business activities to compliance activities.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and may make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The increased costs will increase our net loss. For example, these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain sufficient coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nSpecifically, in order to comply with the requirements of being a public company, we need to undertake various actions, including implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring new accounting or internal audit staff. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Moreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. Shares issued to Merck in the private placement that occurred concurrently with our IPO will be available for sale in the public market beginning on March 17, 2020, subject to the condition of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nSome provisions of our charter documents, Delaware law and our agreement with Merck may have anti-takeover effects or could otherwise discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would benefit our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or to remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which we may establish and shares of which we may issue without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, which is generally a person that together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nCertain provisions in our agreement with Merck may also deter a change of control. For example, under our agreement with Merck, a change of control gives Merck the right to terminate our research and early development program as well as additional rights if our acquirer is a qualifying large pharmaceutical company or has a research, development or commercialization program that competes with a program optioned by Merck.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, Delaware law or our agreement with Merck that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision would not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides further that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees. If a court were to find either choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business. For example, in December 2018 the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that the exclusive forum provision of federal district courts of the United States for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. However, this decision has been appealed to and may ultimately be overturned by the Delaware Supreme Court. If this ultimate adjudication were to occur, the federal district court exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would no longer be applicable.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nOur stock price and trading volume is heavily influenced by the way analysts and investors interpret our financial information and other disclosures. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, delay publishing reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business, regardless of accuracy, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. A limited number of analysts are currently covering our company. If the number of analysts that cover us declines, demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline. Even if our common stock is actively covered by analysts, we do not have any control over the analysts or the measures that analysts or investors may rely upon to forecast our future results. Over-reliance by analysts or investors on any particular metric to forecast our future results may result in forecasts that differ significantly from our own.", "PERMNO": 18561, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "NGM"}
