RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following risks and all other information included in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report are not the only ones facing our business. If any of the following risks were to actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nWe depend on manufacturers to supply inventory to our Distribution segment and rely on one vendor to supply a significant amount of our inventory purchases. If our vendor fails to provide desired products to us, increases prices, or fails to timely deliver products, our revenue and gross profit could suffer. A significant amount of our inventory purchases are made from one vendor, Fluke. Our reliance on this vendor leaves us vulnerable to having an inadequate supply of required products, price increases, late deliveries, and poor product quality. Like other distributors in our industry, we occasionally experience supplier shortages and are unable to purchase our desired volume of products. If we are unable to enter into and maintain satisfactory distribution arrangements with leading manufacturers, if we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of products, or if manufacturers do not regularly invest in, introduce to us, and/or make new products available to us for distribution, our Distribution segment sales could suffer considerably. Finally, we cannot provide any assurance that particular products, or product lines, will be available to us, or available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. This is of particular significance to our Distribution segment business because the products we sell are often only available from one source. Any limits to product access could materially and adversely affect our Distribution segment business.\nVolatility in the oil and gas industry has and could continue to negatively impact our operating results. A portion of our products and services customer base is directly or indirectly related to the oil and gas industry. As a result, demand for some of our products is dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. In addition to the more significant impact on our Distribution segment, an extended downturn in the oil and gas industry or continued volatility in oil and gas prices could impact customers\u2019 demand for some of our services (generally excluding life sciences, our largest industry customer sector), which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur future success may be affected by our current and future indebtedness. Under our revolving credit facility, as of March 26, 2016, we owed $19.1 million to our secured creditor, a commercial bank. We borrowed $10.0 million on April 1, 2016 via a term loan to fund the acquisition of Excalibur and provide us additional working capital. We may borrow additional funds in the future to support our growth and working capital needs. We are required to meet financial tests on a quarterly basis and comply with other covenants customary in secured financings. Although we believe that we will continue to comply with such covenants, if we do not remain in compliance with such covenants, our lender may demand immediate repayment of amounts outstanding. Changes in interest rates may have a significant effect on our payment obligations and operating results. Furthermore, we are dependent on credit from manufacturers of our products to fund our inventory purchases. If our debt burden increases to high levels, such manufacturers may restrict our credit. Our cash requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the rate of growth of our revenues, the timing and levels of products purchased, payment terms, and credit limits from manufacturers, the timing and level of our accounts receivable collections and our ability to manage our business profitably. Our ability to satisfy our existing obligations, whether or not under our secured credit facility, will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, and other factors described in this report, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe relatively low trading volume of our common stock may limit your ability to sell your shares. Although our shares of common stock are listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, we have historically experienced a relatively low trading volume. If our low trading volume continues in the future, holders of our shares may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock in the manner or at a price that they desire.\nIf significant existing shareholders sell large numbers of shares of our common stock, our stock price could decline. The market price of our common stock could decline if a large number of our shares are sold in the public market by our existing shareholders or holders of stock options or as a result of the perception that these sales could occur. Due to the low trading volume of our common stock, the sale of a large number of shares of our common stock may significantly depress the price of our common stock.\nWe expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate. Such fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline. A large portion of our expenses for our Service segment, including expenses for facilities, equipment and personnel are relatively fixed. Accordingly, if revenues decline or do not grow as we anticipate, we may not be able to correspondingly reduce our operating expenses in any particular quarter. Our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future. Historically, our fiscal third and fourth quarters have been stronger than our fiscal first and second quarters due to industrial operating cycles. Fluctuations in industrial demand for products we sell and services we provide could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results in some quarters fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our stock price may decline.\nOur stock price may be volatile. The stock market, from time to time, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are both related and unrelated to the operating performance of companies. Our stock may be affected by market volatility and by our own performance. The following factors, among others, may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf\nDevelopments in our relationships with current or future manufacturers of products we distribute;\n\u25cf\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nLitigation or governmental proceedings or announcements involving us or our industry;\n\u25cf\nEconomic and other external factors, such as disasters or other crises;\n\u25cf\nSales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u25cf\nRepurchases of our common stock on the open market or in privately-negotiated transactions;\n\u25cf\nPeriod-to-period fluctuations in our operating results; and\n\u25cf\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nOur business acquisitions or future business acquisition efforts, which are important to our growth, may not be successful, which may limit our growth or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Business acquisitions have been an important part of our growth to date. As part of our business strategy, we may make additional acquisitions of companies that could complement or expand our business, augment our market coverage, provide us with important relationships or otherwise offer us growth opportunities. If we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate terms or finance the acquisition. If we fail to successfully acquire businesses, our growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not successfully integrate business acquisitions. During fiscal year 2016 we acquired five businesses and completed a sixth acquisition just after the end of fiscal year 2016. If we fail to accurately assess and successfully integrate any recent or future business acquisitions, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, which could result in lower revenues, unanticipated operating expenses, reduced profitability and dilution of our book value per share. Successful integration involves many challenges, including:\n\u25cf\nThe difficulty of integrating acquired operations and personnel with our existing operations;\n\u25cf\nThe difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services;\n\u25cf\nThe diversion of our management\u2019s attention as a result of evaluating, negotiating and integrating acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nOur exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and\n\u25cf\nThe loss of key employees of an acquired operation.\nIn addition, an acquisition could adversely impact cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute shareholder interests, for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf\nCharges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill;\n\u25cf\nInterest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition or new business venture; and\n\u25cf\nAny issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current shareholders.\nIf the integration of any or all of our acquisitions or future acquisitions is not successful, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nAny impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively impact our results of operations. Our goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and are also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill and/or intangible assets may be impaired. Any excess goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets value resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with the businesses we acquire, which may adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets because of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We have completed our annual impairment analysis for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and have concluded that we do not have any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as of March 26, 2016.\nThe financing of any future acquisitions we might make may result in dilution to your stock ownership and/or could increase our leverage and our risk of defaulting on our bank debt. Our business strategy includes expansion into new markets and enhancement of our position in existing markets, including through acquisitions. In order to successfully complete targeted acquisitions, we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute your stock ownership. We may also incur additional debt if we acquire another company, which could significantly increase our leverage and our risk of default under our existing credit facility.\nAdverse changes in general economic conditions or uncertainty about future economic conditions could adversely affect us. We are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in general economic market conditions. Uncertainty about future economic conditions could negatively affect our current and prospective customers causing them to delay the purchase of necessary services or test and measurement instruments. Poor economic conditions could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nThe industries in which we compete are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully. Within our Service segment, we provide calibration services and compete in an industry that is highly fragmented and is composed of companies ranging from internationally recognized and accredited corporations to non-accredited, sole proprietors, resulting in a tremendous range of service levels and capabilities. Also, within our Service segment, we provide compliance services and compete in an industry that is composed of both small local and regional service providers and large multi-national companies who are also OEMs. Within our Service segment, some of our larger competitors may have broader service capabilities and may have greater name recognition than us. Some manufacturers of the products we sell may also offer calibration and compliance services for their products.\nWithin our Distribution segment, we compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors. Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors. Competitors in the product distribution industry could also obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market. Manufacturers could also increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and bypass distributors like us. Industry consolidation among distributors, the unavailability of products, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or interruptions in supply from manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors could also increase competition and adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nIn each of the industries in which we compete, some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully. In the future, we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our sales.\nOur Service segment has a high concentration of customers in the life science and other FDA-regulated and industrial manufacturing industries. A large number of our Service segment customers operate in the pharmaceutical and other FDA-regulated or industrial manufacturing industries. This concentration of our customer base affects our overall risk profile, since a significant portion of our customers will be similarly affected by changes in economic, political, regulatory, and other industry conditions. We anticipate that our Service segment will continue to grow and comprise a greater percentage of our total revenue, which could increase our exposure to fluctuations in the life science and other FDA-regulated or industrial manufacturing industries. An abrupt or unforeseen change in conditions in these industries could adversely affect customer demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nCompetition in our Distribution segment is changing with an increase in web-based distributors. We may not be able to compete successfully. We face substantial and increased competition throughout the world, especially in our Distribution segment where, over the last several fiscal quarters, we have experienced a gradual decline in sales. The competition is changing, with web-based distributors becoming more prevalent and increasing their market share. Some of our competitors are much larger than us. Changes in the competitive landscape pose new challenges that could adversely affect our ability to compete. Entry or expansion of other vendors into this market may establish competitors that have larger customer bases and substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue marketing and distribution of products. Their current customer base and relationships, as well as their relationships and ability to negotiate with manufacturers, may also provide them with a competitive advantage. If we are unable to effectively compete with our current and future competitors, our ability to sell products could be harmed and could result in a negative impact on our Distribution segment. Any erosion of our competitive position could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur enterprise resource planning system is aging and we may experience issues from any implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system. We have an enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d or \u201cApplication Plus\u201d) to assist with the collection, storage, management and interpretation of data from our business activities to support future growth and to integrate significant processes. Although we use current versions of software and have support agreements in place, due to the age of our ERP, we anticipate that a new ERP will be required to be implemented in the future. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming and involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities, as well as changes in business processes. Our ERP system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records, record transactions, provide important information to our management and prepare our consolidated financial statements. ERP implementations also require the transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system; any such transformation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of a new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. Additionally, if the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed.\nWe rely on our CalTrak\u00ae, Application Plus (our ERP) and other management information systems for inventory management, distribution, workflow, accounting and other functions. If our CalTrak\u00ae, Application Plus and other management information systems fail to adequately perform these functions, experience an interruption in their operation or a security breach, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. The efficient operation of our business depends on our management information systems. We rely on our CalTrak\u00ae, Application Plus and other management information systems to effectively manage accounting and financial functions, customer service, warehouse management, order entry, order fulfillment, inventory replenishment, documentation, asset management, and workflow. Our management information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses or hackers, natural or man-made disasters, vandalism, terrorist attacks, power loss, or other computer systems, internet, telecommunications or data network failures. Any such interruptions to our management information systems could disrupt our business and could result in decreased revenues, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our management information systems are vulnerable to security breaches. Our security measures or those of our third-party service providers may fail to detect or prevent such security breaches. Security breaches could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, the unauthorized release of customer, vendor, or employee data and payment information, the violation of privacy or other laws, and the exposure to litigation, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to adapt our technology to meet customer needs and preferences, the demand for our products and services may diminish. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop services and solutions that keep pace with technological change, evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences in the markets we serve. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in adapting existing or developing new technology or services in a timely or cost-effective manner or that the solutions we do develop will be successful in the marketplace. Our failure to keep pace with changes in technology, industry standards and customer preferences in the markets we serve could diminish our ability to retain and attract customers and our competitive position, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with foreign currency rate fluctuations. We currently transact a portion of our business in foreign currencies, namely the Canadian dollar. During fiscal years 2016 and 2015, less than 10% of our total revenues were denominated in Canadian dollars.\nConducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar impacts our revenues, cost of revenues and operating margins and result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses. During fiscal years 2016 and 2015, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to one Canadian dollar ranged from 1.20 to 1.46 and from 1.06 to 1.28, respectively.\nWe continually utilize short-term foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings would be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. However, this strategy does not eliminate our exposure. If there is a significant or prolonged downturn in the Canadian dollar, it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nIf we fail to attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our stated corporate objectives. Our ability to manage our anticipated growth, if realized, effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers and technical personnel. If we fail to attract and retain qualified individuals, we will not be able to achieve our stated corporate objectives.\nOur revenue depends on retaining capable sales personnel and highly skilled service technicians as well as maintaining existing relationships with key customers, key vendors and manufacturers of the products that we distribute. Our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel and skilled service technicians as well as key customers, vendors and manufacturers who appreciate the value of our services. If we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management. Our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management. Competition for senior management is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel, the inability of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nTax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our net earnings and tax liabilities. We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirement under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which may cause investors to have less confidence in our internal control over financial reporting. The auditor attestation requirement under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides that a public company\u2019s independent auditor must attest to and report on management\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Because we qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the applicable SEC regulation, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirement. The lack of an auditor attestation concerning management\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may cause investors to have less confidence in our internal control over financial reporting and increases the risk that any material weakness or other deficiencies in our internal controls will not be detected.\nChanges in accounting standards, legal requirements and The NASDAQ Stock Market listing standards, or our ability to comply with any existing requirements or standards, could adversely affect our operating results. Extensive reforms relating to public company financial reporting, corporate governance and ethics, The NASDAQ Stock Market listing standards and oversight of the accounting profession have been implemented over the past several years and continue to evolve. Compliance with these rules, regulations and standards that have resulted from such reforms has increased our accounting and legal costs and has required significant management time and attention. In the event that additional rules, regulations or standards are implemented or any of the existing rules, regulations or standards to which we are subject undergoes additional material modification, we could be forced to spend significant financial and management resources to ensure our continued compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, although we believe we are in full compliance with all such existing rules, regulations and standards, should we be or become unable to comply with any of such rules, regulations and standards, as they presently exist or as they may exist in the future, our results of operations could be adversely effected and the market price of our common stock could decline.", "PERMNO": 76946, "SIC": 5084, "TIC": "TRNS"}
