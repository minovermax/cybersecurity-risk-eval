{"cik": "741815", "company": "HOOPER HOLMES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all the information included in this Report, particularly the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in our shares of common stock. Additional risks not presently known to or understood by us may also negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nBusiness Risks\nOur business results would be adversely affected if we were alleged or found to have violated certain regulatory requirements.\nOur business is subject to varying degrees of state and federal regulation. For example, our operations are subject to regulations regarding licensing (supervision of phlebotomists, the conduct of certain specimen draws, and requirements for conducting health screening fairs). We are subject to federal and state laws, including testing and collection regulations and HIPAA rules, regarding security and privacy of personal health information and other personal information. Although we devote substantial effort to comply with these regulatory requirements, there is a continuing risk that regulators may find compliance violations, which could subject us to significant liability and/or damage our relationship with our customers.\nOur business results may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and deploy health professionals and other medical personnel.\nWe believe a key to growth in our health and wellness operations is maintaining and managing a large, national network of highly trained medical personnel who can meet our customers' needs in markets nationwide. Although many of our health professionals also work for competitors, our goal is to offer them equal or greater opportunities so that they will be available to provide services to our customers. If we are unable to recruit and retain an appropriate base of health professionals, it may limit our ability to maintain and/or grow our screening operations.\nOur business results may be adversely affected if we are unable to implement the restructuring plans currently being developed by our Chief Restructuring Officer (\"CRO\").\nOur CRO and management team are in the process of developing a restructuring plan. They are considering all available options to develop a plan to repay the Company\u2019s secured and unsecured creditors and to provide a platform for the Company to begin operating in a financially sustainable manner. The plan, when finalized, may involve significant changes to our business model, including any or all of the following: divestitures of lines of business, reductions in staffing, changes to the type and pricing of our service offerings, and changes in our marketing and sales strategies and client mix. We can give no assurance that the plan, when finalized and implemented, will successfully address our ongoing financial and liquidity difficulties.\nFuture claims arising from the sale of our business units (discontinued operations) could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf claims for which we may be liable arise related to our discontinued operations in the future, this may result in additional cost to us which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our revenue from a limited number of customers and a loss of some or all of the business of one or more customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is derived through our relationships with both direct customers and our channel partners. In 2017, one direct customer accounted for over 10% of consolidated revenue. Our three largest channel partners, combined, account for just over 20% of our revenue. While we have agreements with each of our customers and channel partners, the vast majority of the agreements do not provide for any specified minimum level of purchases of services from us. If one or more of our customers or channel partners was to significantly reduce its purchases of biometric screening and other sample collection services from us, it could significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. If this were to occur, we would face significant challenges in replacing the lost revenues.\nA number of circumstances could prompt the loss of one or more of our key customers or a substantial portion of its or their business. For example, if one of our customers were to be acquired by or merged into another company for whom we do not provide services, we could lose the acquired company\u2019s business. We could lose one or more significant customers if they perceive one or more of our competitors to be superior in price or quality and choose not to renew our contract.\nCompetition could negatively impact our business.\nThe health and wellness industry is competitive, which could result in loss of our market share due to pressure to reduce prices or increase services without charging additional fees. For screening services, we compete primarily with private companies who provide screening services in certain geographic areas in the United States. There are also a few national providers with the ability to service customers nationally like we do. For health and wellness, we compete primarily with established wellness and care management providers, startup companies, and health plans that offer their own proprietary solutions. We are one of the only health and wellness providers that offers a fully integrated, end-to-end screening and wellness solution to our customers which we believe gives us an advantage over our competitors who also serve companies with more than 1,000 employees, our primary target market. If one of the national health and wellness companies that currently focuses on larger employers were to develop a service offering in our target market at a lower price point than we offer, we could lose market share or be forced to cut our prices and lose margin in order to retain customers.\nWe are dependent on CRL as our exclusive laboratory services provider. If CRL fails to perform adequately under the Limited Laboratory and Administrative Services Agreement or we face difficulties in managing our relationship with CRL, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the Limited Laboratory and Administrative Services Agreement (\"LLASA\") between us and CRL, which became effective August 31, 2014, CRL is our exclusive provider, with certain limited exceptions, of laboratory testing and reporting services in support of our screening services. The LLASA has a term of 5 years and will automatically renew for an additional 5 year period unless sooner terminated. Our dependence on CRL makes our operations vulnerable to CRL\u2019s failure to perform adequately under our contract with them. In addition, the services that CRL renders to us are services that we are required to provide under contracts with our clients, and we are responsible for such performance and could be held accountable by the client for any failure to perform. The LLASA has service level requirements of CRL and we perform ongoing oversight activities to identify any performance or other issues related to our relationship with CRL. If CRL were to fail to provide the services that we require or expect, or fails to meet its contractual requirements, such as service levels or compliance with applicable laws, the failure could negatively impact our business by adversely affecting our ability to serve our customers and/or subject us to regulatory or litigation risk. Such a failure could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we cannot successfully implement, maintain and upgrade our information technology platforms so that we can meet customer requirements, the competitiveness of our businesses will suffer.\nThe speed and accuracy with which we make information available to our customers is critical. As a result, we are dependent on our information technology platforms and our ability to store, retrieve, process, manage and enable timely and secure customer access to the health-related and other data we gather on behalf of our customers. Disruption of the operation of our IT systems for any extended period of time, loss of stored data, programming errors or other system failures could cause customers to turn elsewhere to address their service needs. In addition, we must continue to enhance our IT systems, with potentially substantial cost, as the need for service, product and technology requirements advances. In addition, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, and spamming could harm our business and results of operations.\nAllegations of negligent or improper actions by our health professionals or other personnel could result in claims against us and/or our incurring expenses to indemnify our clients.\nAllegations of negligent or improper actions by our health or other medical professionals could result in claims against us, require us to indemnify our clients for any harm they may suffer, or damage our reputation and relationships with important clients. Our clients rely on the accuracy of the medical data we gather on their behalf in aggregated form to manage their wellness program. We maintain professional liability insurance and such other coverage as we believe appropriate, but such insurance may prove insufficient. Regardless of insurance, any such claims could damage our reputation and relationships with important clients.\nOur operations could be adversely affected by the effects of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism.\nOur operations would be adversely affected in the event of a natural disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane, or an act of terrorism. A natural disaster or act of terrorism could disrupt our ability to provide testing services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nAttacks on our information technology systems, or failure in these systems, could disrupt its operations and cause the loss of confidential information, customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact its business.\nInformation technology or IT systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of data. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. Unauthorized persons may seek to obtain intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our IT systems. Moreover, despite the security measures we have implemented, our IT systems may be subject to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses, unauthorized tampering and similar disruptive problems.\nWe have taken precautionary measures to prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our IT systems, including the loss or theft of intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our systems. In addition, we continue to strengthen precautionary measures to reduce the risk of, and to detect and respond to, future cyber threats. However, cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to its customers, compromise intellectual property or confidential information or otherwise adversely impact the business. There can\nbe no assurances that our precautionary measures will prevent or successfully defend against cyber threats that could have a significant impact on the business.\nFinancial and Liquidity\nOur recurring losses from operations, negative operating cash flows and need to obtain cash flow from operations or adequate funding to fund our comprehensive recovery plan raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after issuance date of the consolidated financial statements.\nIn their report dated April 16, 2018, which is also included in this Form 10-K, our independent registered public accounting firm stated that our consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming we would continue as a going concern; however, our recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, and liquidity raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after issuance date of the consolidated financial statements. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern (which contemplates the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future). These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7 for further discussion.\nOur CRO\u2019s restructuring plans may not resolve our liquidity issues.\nOn March 26, 2018, we engaged the services of a CRO. The CRO\u2019s principal duties in the immediate term is to establish a working capital plan, with the broader mandate to include developing and implementing plans to restructure our balance sheet, operating expense structure, and overall strategies in an effort to resolve our going concern assessment. As the restructuring plans are developed and implemented, the Company may make significant operational and financial changes that could result in the loss of key employees, customers, and vendors, which could in turn have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. If any of these eventualities arise, or if the restructuring activities are otherwise not successful, we may be unable to resolve our liquidity issues or continue as a going concern.\nReduction in cash flow from operations in 2018 may limit our ability to make the desired level of investment in our businesses and may result in a continuation of our liquidity issues.\nWe are taking steps to address and correct the primary causes of recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, and liquidity concerns primarily through the acquisition of PHS, the use of debt instruments and raising additional equity. We used approximately $12.0 million of cash in operations in 2017. If revenue growth does not continue as expected, our cost reduction measures are not successful, or we are unable to maintain our current receivable collection results, we may be unable to make needed investments in our operations or to comply with our debt covenants and have sufficient eligible receivables to maintain borrowing capacity under our Credit and Security Agreement, as amended, (the \"2016 Credit and Security Agreement\") with CNH Finance (\"CNH\"). See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur liquidity may be adversely affected by the terms of our 2016 Credit and Security Agreement with CNH and the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended, (the \"A&R Credit Agreement\") with SWK Funding LLC (\"SWK\").\nIf we need to borrow in the future under our 2016 Credit and Security Agreement, as amended, the amount available for borrowing may be less than the $15.0 million under this facility at any given time due to the manner in which the maximum available amount is calculated. We have an available borrowing base subject to reserves established at the lender's discretion of 85% of Eligible Receivables up to $15.0 million under this facility. At December 31, 2017, we had $10.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit and Security Agreement, with unused borrowing capacity of $1.8 million. As of March 30, 2018, we had $4.9 million of outstanding borrowings with unused borrowing capacity of $0.2 million.\nThe A&R Credit Agreement with SWK provides us with a $8.5 million term loan (the \"Term Loan\"). In 2017, the A&R Credit Agreement increased the principal balance under the existing former term loan to $6.5 million and provided for an additional $2.0 million term loan (the \u201cAugust 2017 Term Loan\u201d). The A&R Credit Agreement also includes a revolving seasonal credit facility (the \u201cSeasonal Facility\u201d) pursuant to which we are able to borrow up to $2.0 million between June 1 and November 30, 2017 and 2018.\nThe debt agreements with CNH and SWK described above contain certain financial covenants, including various affirmative and negative covenants including minimum aggregate revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and consolidated unencumbered liquid assets\nrequirements, which we did not comply with as of December 31, 2017. On February 2, 2018, we entered into a Third Amendment to the A&R Credit Agreement which provided a waiver for the measurement period ended December 31, 2017, in the event the Company is able to pay $250,000 on March 15, 2018, and the remaining balance of the August 2017 Term Loan in full, prior to April 30, 2018. We were not able to make our March 15, 2018, payment; therefore, we defaulted on our loan with SWK and, due to the cross-default clause with CNH, were also in default on our 2016 Credit and Security Agreement. Even though we are in default, the lenders have not yet elected to exercise their rights under the agreements to declare the obligations immediately due and payable. CNH and SWK have reserved the right to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding and exercise remedies with respect to collateral, which would have a material adverse impact on our business. Additionally, the negative covenants set forth in the debt agreements with CNH and SWK prohibit us from incurring additional debt of any kind without prior approval from the lenders. In addition, CNH has reserved the right to terminate access to the unused borrowing capacity under the 2016 Credit and Security Agreement. If we are unable to negotiate forbearance agreements or waivers of the existing covenant and payment defaults with SWK and SCM, raise sufficient capital to repay the facilities, or replace the facilities with new debt facilities, the defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business. For additional information regarding the 2016 Credit and Security Agreement, the A&R Credit Agreement, and the related covenants, refer to Note 2 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nWe incurred additional indebtedness in connection with our merger with PHS, and such increased indebtedness could adversely affect our business, cash flows and results of operations and did result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nOn May 11, 2017, we closed the transactions (the \u201cMerger\u201d) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 7, 2017 (the \"Merger Agreement\") by and among Hooper Holmes, Piper Merger Corp., PHS, and Wellness Holdings, LLC. PHS was the surviving entity in the Merger, as a result of which it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hooper Holmes. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIn order to fund the Merger, we entered into and amended our A&R Credit Agreement with SWK. The A&R Credit Agreement provides us with a $8.5 million Term Loan and includes the Seasonal Facility pursuant to which we are able to borrow up to $2.0 million between June 1 and November 30, 2017 and 2018. Additionally, we entered into and amended the 2016 Credit and Security Agreement with CNH which expanded our revolving credit facility from $7.0 million to $10.0 million with an accordion to $15.0 million during high-volume months, at the discretion of CNH. As a result, we have indebtedness that is substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to the Merger. This higher level of indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue other investments, and use for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates on our borrowings that bear interest at variable rates or when such indebtedness is being refinanced;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges related to our business and industry, creating competitive disadvantages compared to other competitors with lower debt levels and borrowing costs.\nWe cannot assure you that cash flows from operations, combined with any additional borrowings available to us, will be obtainable in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. The Credit Agreement, as amended, contains customary representations and warranties and various affirmative and negative covenants including minimum aggregate revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and consolidated unencumbered liquid assets requirements. Noncompliance with these covenants constitutes an event of default. As of December 31, 2017, we were not in compliance with the required minimum covenants. Refer to Note 2 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. There can be no assurance that cash flows from operations, combined with any additional borrowings available to us, will be obtainable in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Merger Agreement signed on March 7, 2017.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income or future tax may be limited due to the changes in ownership (within the meaning of IRC Section 382) that have occurred in the past.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or IRC, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income, and an ownership change is generally defined as a cumulative change of 50% or more in the ownership positions of certain shareholders during a rolling three-year period. The ownership change which occurred as a result of the Merger is likely to restrict our ability to use our NOL carry forwards. Furthermore, a significant portion of our NOL carryforwards is expected to be eliminated.\nWeakness in the economy in general, or the financial health or performance of the healthcare industry and healthcare sponsors in particular, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe derive our revenues from customers in the healthcare industry, including healthcare sponsors. If the condition of the U.S. economy weakens in certain areas, such as an increase in unemployment rates, demand for biometric screening services may decline in the future, resulting in less business for our Company. If some of our healthcare customers fail or curtail operations in the healthcare industry, such failures or curtailments of operations would result in less business for our Company. Either event would negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actions taken by Congress with respect to repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act could have a detrimental impact on the healthcare industry and our healthcare customers that could lead to or worsen the effects of the events described in this paragraph.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our period end disclosure controls and procedures and in our internal control over financial reporting, and our business and our stock price may be adversely affected if we do not adequately address that weakness or if we have other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe have identified certain deficiencies in our period end disclosure controls and procedures and in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for non-routine transactions that we deemed to be material weaknesses. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. We determined that the complexities of the accounting for these non-routine transactions adversely affected management\u2019s review of the accounting for non-routine, complex technical accounting matters to ensure proper application of generally accepted accounting principles in a timely manner.\nWhile these material weaknesses continue to exist, we have taken steps to address these weaknesses in internal control. We plan to enhance our controls related to period end disclosure and non-routine transactions by supplementing with additional resources as necessary, enhancing the design and documentation of management review controls, and improving the documentation of internal control procedures. Despite these measures and planned improvements, our remediation efforts could be insufficient to address the material weakness in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing shareholders or restrict our operations.\nAdditional financing may not be available to us when it is needed or may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over our common stock. Any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem Company stock or make investments.\nRestructuring activities may lead to significant dilution to existing shareholders, reductions in the market value of our shares, or sale of the Company.\nUnder the restructuring plan being developed by our CRO, we will consider all available options for strengthening our balance sheet through acquisitions and divestitures, capital-raising activities, and restructuring existing obligations. These activities could result in significant dilution of our existing shareholders\u2019 stock ownership, reductions in our common stock\u2019s market value, or in the sale of the Company.\nOnly a limited market exists for our common stock which could lead to price volatility.\nThe limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our common stock. Market prices for securities of health and wellness companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning us, key customers or competitors;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in operating results and liquidity;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to technology or litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to ours;\n\u2022\nacquisitions and financings;\n\u2022\nsales and purchases of our stock by insiders;\n\u2022\ninability to meet debt covenants and potential default;\n\u2022\na slowdown in the health and wellness industry or the general economy;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain adequate supply of the components for any of our products or services, or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nperformance of third parties on whom the combined company may rely, including for the manufacture or supply of the components for its products or services, including their ability to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nunanticipated or serious safety concerns related to the use of any of the combined company\u2019s products or services;\n\u2022\nthe entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key customer or commercial partner agreements;\n\u2022\nthe initiation of, material developments in or conclusion of litigation to enforce or defend any of the combined organization\u2019s intellectual property rights or defend against the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nannouncements by the combined company, commercial partners or competitors of new products or product enhancements, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing technologies and products or new technologies and products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nthe additions or departures of key employees;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect the combined organization\u2019s expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe low trading volume and the high proportion of shares held by affiliates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of health and wellness payment systems; and period-to-period fluctuations in the combined organization\u2019s financial results.\nOur shareholders may not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger.\nIf we are unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, our shareholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their share ownership without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent we are able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and declined since the Merger and may continue to be volatile and/or decline.\nThe market price of our common stock following the Merger has been subject to significant fluctuations following the Merger. These fluctuations may continue as we develop and implement a restructuring plan with the guidance of our CRO. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\ninvestors may react negatively to the prospects of the combined organization\u2019s business and prospects from the Merger and the restructuring plan;\n\u2022\nthe effect of the Merger on the combined organization\u2019s business and prospects may not be consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts, or analysts may change their estimates or recommendations;\n\u2022\nthe reaction of secured and unsecured creditors and customers to the restructuring plan when it has been developed;\n\u2022\nindustry-specific or general economic conditions may affect the combined organization, including a slowdown in the health and wellness industry or the general economy;\n\u2022\nperformance of third parties on whom the combined organization may rely, including suppliers and independent contractors;\n\u2022\nthe entry into, modification or termination of, key agreements, including key customer or commercial partner agreements;\n\u2022\nthe initiation of, material developments in or conclusion of litigation related to the combined organization;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing technologies, products or services, or new technologies, products or services that may emerge;\n\u2022\nthe low trading volume and the high proportion of shares held by affiliates; and\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in the combined organization\u2019s financial results.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm the combined organization\u2019s profitability and reputation.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common shares, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common shares, as well as any common shares that may be issued pursuant to our executive compensation plans. The market price of our common shares could decline as a result of the issuance or sale of our common shares after the Merger or the perception that such issuances or sales could occur.\nThe ownership of our common stock after the Merger is currently highly concentrated, and this may result in perceived conflicts of interest that could cause our stock price to decline.\nFollowing completion of the Merger, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 53% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including shares beneficially owned by a director whose holdings include most of the shares beneficially owned by former PHS equity holders. The former PHS equity holders beneficially own approximately 47% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, these executive officers, directors and their affiliates, acting as a group, have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transactions. These shareholders may also delay or prevent a change of control of our company, even if such a change of control would benefit our other shareholders. The rights of the former PHS equity holders are subject to the Voting and Standstill Agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Merger. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nTrading on the OTCQX tier of the OTC Markets may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nSince May 2, 2017, our common stock has been quoted on the OTCQX tier of the electronic quotation system operated by OTC Markets. Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Markets is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like the NYSE MKT. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares and the lack of liquidity may negatively impact our ability to pursue strategic alternatives.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of its common shares.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common shares, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common shares, as well as any common shares that may be issued pursuant to its shareholder rights plan. The market price of our common shares could decline as a result of sales of its common shares made under the restructuring plan being developed by our CRO or the perception that such sales could occur.\nThe sale or issuance of our common stock to Lincoln Park may cause dilution and the sale of the shares of our common stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOn August 31, 2017, we entered into the Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to $10.0 million of our common stock. Upon the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued 450,000 Commitment Shares to Lincoln Park as a fee for its commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement. The remaining shares of our common stock that may be issued under the Purchase Agreement may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 36-month period commencing after the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including that the SEC has declared effective the registration statement that includes this prospectus. The purchase price for the shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock. Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nWe generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any future sales of our shares to Lincoln Park. Additional sales of our common stock, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to Lincoln Park all, some, or none of the additional shares of our common stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. If and when we do sell shares to Lincoln Park, after Lincoln Park has acquired the shares, Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of those shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion.\nIn addition, if we sell shares to Lincoln Park at a price per share lower than $0.80, we may be required to issue additional shares to the purchasers in our 2017 private offering pursuant to the \u201cfull ratchet\u201d provisions set forth in the securities purchase agreements we entered into with such purchasers. If the ratchet is triggered, we would be required to issue a number of additional shares of our common stock sufficient to cause the effective price per share paid by the purchasers in the 2017 private offering to be equal to the new offering price, subject to certain limitations set forth in the securities purchase agreements we entered into with such purchasers. If the ratchet provision is triggered, we would be required to issue a maximum of 831,289 shares to the purchasers in the 2017 private offering, including 48,352 shares to Lincoln Park and 24,176 shares to Aracle SPF V, LLC, each of which participated in the offering.
