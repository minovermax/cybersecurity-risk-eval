Risk Factors\nIf recovery from the economic downturn reverses or recession returns, our credit risk will increase and there could be greater loan losses.\nA reversal in economic recovery or return to recession is likely to result in a higher rate of business closures and increased job losses in the region in which we do business. In addition, reduced State funding for the public colleges and universities that are large employers in our market area could have an adverse effect on employment levels and on the area\u2019s economy. These factors would increase the likelihood that more of our customers would become delinquent or default on their loans. A higher level of loan defaults could result in higher loan losses, which could adversely affect our performance.\nA reversal in economic recovery or return to recession could increase the risk of losses in our investment portfolio.\nThe Company holds both corporate and municipal bonds in its investment portfolio. A reversal in economic recovery or return to recession could increase the actual or perceived risk of default by both corporate and government issuers and, in either case, could adversely affect the value of these investments. In addition, the value of these investments could be affected by a change in interest rates and related factors, including the pricing of securities.\nThe continued weak condition of the local real estate market could negatively affect our business.\nA depressed real estate market impacts us in several ways. The demand for new real estate loans has declined, and a portion of our existing loans have become delinquent. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s real property collateral is located in its market area. If there is a continued decline in real estate values, especially in the Company\u2019s market area, the collateral for loans would deteriorate and provide significantly less security.\nFocus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase its credit risk.\nMost of Company\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates negatively impact this important customer sector, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by the Company in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. The deterioration of the borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket interest rates are currently low. If market interest rates rise, our net interest income can be negatively affected in the short term.\nThe direction and speed of interest rate changes affect our net interest margin and net interest income. In the short term, rising interest rates may negatively affect our net interest income, because our interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits) reprice sooner than our interest-earning assets (generally loans).\nThe allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nIn accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, an allowance for loan losses is maintained to provide for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect operating results. The allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating, and other outside forces and conditions, including changes in interest rates, all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control; and these losses may exceed current estimates. Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review the Company\u2019s loans and allowance for loan losses. While management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover current losses, it cannot make assurances that it will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that regulators will not require it to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences could adversely affect earnings.\nThe allowance for loan losses requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of this estimate, management cannot provide assurance that it will not significantly increase the allowance for loan losses, which could materially and adversely affect earnings.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s nonperforming assets adversely affect its net income in various ways. Until economic and market conditions stabilize, the Company expects to continue to incur additional losses relating to volatility in nonperforming loans. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans, which adversely affects its income and increases credit administration costs. When the Company receives collateral through foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, which may, and often does, result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets also increases the Company\u2019s risk profile and may impact the capital levels regulators believe are appropriate in light of such risks. The Company utilizes various techniques such as workouts and restructurings to manage problem assets. Increases in or negative adjustments in the value of these problem assets, the underlying collateral, or in the borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, including generation of new loans. There can be no assurance that the Company will avoid further increases in nonperforming loans in the future.\nThe Company relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate which secures a significant portion of its loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if the Company is forced to foreclose upon such loans.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. The Company relies upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such real estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment which adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of the Company\u2019s loans may be more or less valuable than anticipated at the time the loans were made. If a default occurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, the Company may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan and will suffer a loss.\nAn increase in bank failures nationwide could significantly increase the cost of FDIC insurance.\nSince insured depositary institutions, including our bank, bear the full cost of deposit insurance provided by FDIC, a high number of bank failures could put additional pressure on a stressed Deposit Insurance Fund. This possibility could in turn lead to higher assessments that could negatively impact our earnings.\nIf more competitors come into our market area, our business could suffer.\nThe financial services industry in our market area is highly competitive, with a number of commercial banks, credit unions, insurance companies and stockbrokers seeking to do business with our customers. If there is additional competition from new business or if our existing competitors focus more attention on our market, we could lose customers and our business could suffer.\nAdditional laws and regulations could lead to a significant increase in our regulatory burden.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations will result in greater compliance costs and may reduce the profitability of some of our products and services. Implementation of the proposed Basel III rules for capital could increase our compliance costs because of the complexity in the risk assessment rules. Both federal and state governments could enact new laws affecting financial institutions that would increase our regulatory burden and could negatively affect our profits.\nNew laws and regulations could limit our sources of noninterest income.\nNew laws and regulations could limit our ability to offer certain profitable products and services or require that we offer unprofitable products and services. This could have a negative effect on the level of noninterest income.\nIntense oversight by regulators could result in stricter requirements and higher overhead costs.\nThe regulatory environment could cause financial industry regulators to impose additional requirements, such as higher capital limits, which would impact the Company\u2019s earnings.\nPolitical stalemates in the U.S. and world governments could negatively affect the financial markets.\nPolitical stalemates in the U.S. and world governments could affect financial markets and affect fiscal policy which could negatively affect our investment portfolio and earnings.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or security breach.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our internet banking, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to operations and the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Company has invested in accepted technologies, and annually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged or disclosed. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our communications and information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company\u2019s business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While the Company has selected these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problem caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failures of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt the Company\u2019s operations if those difficulties interface with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to the Company\u2019s business operations.\nConsumers may increasingly decide not to use the Bank to complete their financial transactions, which would have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in funding for higher education could materially affect our business.\nFederal and state support for public colleges and universities in the Company\u2019s market area has been adversely affected by the recession and budgetary considerations. As a result, our business may be adversely affected from declines in university programs, capital projects, employment and other related factors.\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and prospects.\nThe Company currently depends on the services of a number of key management personnel. The loss of key personnel could materially and adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s success also depends in part on the ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel. Competition for such personnel is strong and the Company may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel it requires.", "PERMNO": 87505, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "NKSH"}
