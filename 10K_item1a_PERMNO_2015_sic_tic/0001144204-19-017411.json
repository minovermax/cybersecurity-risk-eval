{"cik": "1507957", "company": "Ideal Power Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this report.\nThe risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize, that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to the Company\nWe lack an established operating history on which to evaluate our business and determine if we will be able to execute our business plan. We have also incurred losses in prior periods, expect to incur losses in the future and currently generate no revenue.\nWe were formed in Texas on May 17, 2007 and converted to a Delaware corporation on July 15, 2013. We have a limited operating history that makes it difficult to evaluate our business. We have discontinued our power conversion systems division which has historically accounted for all of our sales and we cannot say with certainty when we will commercialize our B-TRAN\u2122 technology, if ever, and thus do not expect to generate any revenue in the near future.\nSince inception, we have sustained approximately $63 million in net losses and we had a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 of approximately $7.9 million. We expect to have operating losses at least until such time as we have commercialized our B-TRAN\u2122 technology and developed a substantial and stable revenue base. We cannot assure you that we can develop a stable revenue base or achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nAs sales of our discontinued products have generated limited operating revenues, we have been funding operations primarily through the sale of common stock. We currently generate no revenue and, in order to fund our operations going forward, will need to raise additional funds and such funds may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business plan and generate sustainable revenue. This may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event we are not able to continue operations, investors will likely suffer a complete loss of their investments in our securities.\nOur future success is difficult to predict because we will likely target certain emerging and evolving markets\nThe electric and hybrid vehicles electronic controls and renewable energy and energy storage system power converter markets are emerging and evolving markets which may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and which may lead to period to period variability in our operating results. Our potential products are based on unique technology which we believe offers significant advantages in these markets, but these markets are in a relatively early stage of development and it is uncertain how rapidly they will develop. It is also uncertain whether our potential products will achieve high levels of demand and acceptance in these markets and as these markets grow. If companies in these industries do not perceive or value the benefits of our technologies and future products, or if they are unwilling to adopt our products as alternatives to traditional power switch solutions, the market for our potential products may not develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, which could significantly and adversely impact our future operating results.\nWe may also be subject to business cycles. The timing, length, and volatility of these business cycles may be difficult to predict. These markets may be cyclical because of sudden changes in customers\u2019 manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, overall customer demand, the availability and amount of government incentive programs, inventory levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital. These changes may affect the timing and amounts of customers\u2019 purchases and investments in technology, and materially affect our future licensing revenue and net income. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nProduct development is an inherently uncertain process, and we may encounter unanticipated development challenges and may not be able to meet our product design and commercialization milestones.\nPrototype development and testing may be subject to unanticipated and significant delays, expenses and technical or other problems. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve our milestones within our planned timeframe or ever. We are in the process of developing prototypes of B-TRAN\u2122 devices prior to the commercialization of these products. We cannot predict whether prototypes of the B-TRAN\u2122 will achieve results consistent with our expectations and third-party simulations. A prototype could cost significantly more than expected or the prototype design and construction process could uncover problems that are not consistent with our expectations. Prototypes of B-TRAN\u2122 devices are a material part of our business plan, and if they are not proven to be successful, our business and prospects would be harmed.\nMore generally, the future commercialization of products using our technology and designs may also be adversely affected by many factors not within our control, including:\n\u2022 the willingness of market participants to try new products incorporating our technology and the perceptions of these market participants of the safety, reliability, functionality and cost effectiveness of these products;\n\u2022 the emergence of newer, possibly more effective technologies;\n\u2022 the future cost and availability of the raw materials and components needed to manufacture and use products incorporating our technology; and\n\u2022 the adoption of new regulatory or industry standards that may adversely affect the use or cost of products incorporating our technology.\nAccordingly, we cannot predict that products incorporating our technology will be accepted on a scale sufficient to support development of mass markets for them.\nOur semiconductor fabrication partners may be unable to successfully and cost-effectively develop and implement new process steps necessary for bi-directional semiconductor device development at scale.\nWhile the manufacturing of B-TRAN\u2122 devices uses conventional equipment and process steps, there is heightened risk in the fabrication process due to the handling and processing of both sides of the wafer and achieving the required front to back alignment of the features. Two-sided wafer processing and handling is necessary as the B-TRAN\u2122, unlike conventional power semiconductor devices, is a two-sided bi-directional device. In addition, the cost to manufacture a B-TRAN\u2122 will be impacted by the number of process steps, the processing time and the size of the wafer. Current B-TRAN\u2122 prototypes under development utilize a smaller 4-inch diameter wafer resulting in fewer die per wafer. As a result, the cost per die is higher than if larger diameter wafers were utilized. For example, if a 6-inch wafer was used it would have twice the area and thus could produce twice as many die as a six inch wafer resulting in a lower cost per die. If our semiconductor fabricator partners are unable to successfully and cost-effectively develop and implement new process steps necessary for bi-directional semiconductor device development at the prototype stage or at scale, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThere are a limited number of semiconductor fabrication development facilities in the United States. There are also a limited number of well-capitalized semiconductor fabricators working with the small diameter wafers necessary for our current development. Our inability to engage such partners in a cost-effective manner or the loss of any fabrication development partner once engaged may materially delay our development efforts and may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe, or our licensees, must achieve design wins to obtain customers, although design wins achieved may not necessarily result in substantial sales or licensing revenue to us.\nWe anticipate that our future designs will typically be integrated into systems by our potential customers. This may result in the need to customize our designs for certain applications or customers. We will need to work with semiconductor partners and/or manufacturers early in their design cycles to ensure that our designs will meet the requirements of their systems. Manufacturers typically choose one or two vendors to provide the components for use in their systems. Selection as one of these vendors is called a design win. It is critical that we, or our licensees, achieve these design wins in order to obtain customers and generate sales and licensing revenue.\nWe believe that equipment manufacturers often select their suppliers based on factors including long-term relationships and end user demand. Accordingly, we may have difficulty achieving design wins from equipment manufacturers as our products will be new entrants into the market. Our efforts to achieve design wins, or assist our licensees in achieving design wins, may be time consuming and expensive and may not be successful. If we or our licensees are not successful in achieving design wins, or if we or our licensees do achieve design wins but the customers\u2019 systems that utilize our designs are not successful, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOnce a manufacturer chooses a component for use in a particular system, it is likely to retain that component for the life of that system. In addition, the sales cycle into certain potential target markets such as the automotive market are typically very long. Our future growth could experience material and prolonged adverse effects if we fail to achieve design wins or if the design wins do not result in substantial revenue for us.\nOur corporate realignment and strategic shift may not be successful.\nOn April 16, 2018, we realigned our two operating divisions: Power Conversion Systems, to continue the commercialization of our PPSA\u2122 technology, and B-TRAN, to develop our B-TRAN\u2122 solid state switch technology. On January 2, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a strategic shift to focus on the commercialization of our BTRAN\u2122 technology and a plan to suspend further power converter system, or PPSA\u2122, development and sales while we locate a buyer for our power conversion systems division and PPSA\u2122 technology. The success of this strategic shift will depend on our ability to successfully fabricate engineering samples for engineering evaluation and evaluation by our potential customers and partners for our B-TRAN\u2122 technology, retain senior management or other highly qualified personnel and obtain sufficient resources, including additional capital. Accordingly, there are no assurances our change in strategic focus will be successful, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have received grant funds from the United States for the development of a bi-directional switch. In certain instances, the United States may obtain title to inventions related to this effort. If we were to lose title to those inventions, we may have to pay to license them from the United States in order to manufacture the inventions. If we were unable to license those inventions from the United States, it could slow down our product development.\nIn conjunction with the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, grant we received from the Department of Energy, we granted to the United States a non-exclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States inventions related to the bi-directional switch and made within the scope of the grant. If we fail to disclose to the Department of Energy an invention made with grant funds that we disclose to patent counsel or for publication, or if we elect not to retain title to the invention, the United States may request that title to the subject invention be transferred to it.\nWe also granted \u201cmarch-in-rights\u201d to the United States in connection with any bi-directional switch inventions in which we choose not to retain title, if those inventions are made under the ARPA-E grant. Pursuant to the march-in-rights, the United States has the right to require us, any person to whom we have assigned our rights, or any exclusive licensee to grant a non-exclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant upon terms that are reasonable. If the license is not granted as requested, the United States has the right to grant the license if it determines that we have not achieved practical application of the invention in the field of use, the action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, the action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements have not been satisfied, or the action is necessary because an agreement to manufacture the invention in the United States has not been obtained or waived or because any such agreement has been breached.\nIf we lost title to the United States as a result of any of these events, we would have to pay to license the inventions, if needed, from the United States to manufacture the bi-directional switch. If we were unable to license those inventions from the United States, it could slow down our product development.\nAs we continue to grow and to develop our intellectual property, we could attract threats from patent monetization firms or competitors alleging infringement. We may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nAs we continue to grow and to develop our intellectual property, we could attract threats from patent monetization firms or competitors alleging infringement of intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, some of our future competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. If we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we may be required to: pay monetary damages; stop commercial activities relating to our product; obtain one or more licenses in order to secure the rights to continue manufacturing or marketing certain products; or attempt to compete in the market with substantially similar products. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue some of our operations.\nWe expect to license our technology in the future; however the terms of these agreements may not prove to be advantageous to us. If the license agreements we enter into do not prove to be advantageous to us, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe intend to employ a licensing strategy for our B-TRAN\u2122 technology. However, we may not be able to secure license agreements with semiconductor fabrication partners or other strategic partners at all or on terms that are advantageous to us. Furthermore, the timing and volume of revenue earned from license agreements will be outside of our control. If the license agreements we enter into in the future do not prove to be advantageous to us, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAny future revenue will rely on the marketing and sales efforts of third parties whom we do not control.\nWe expect that the marketing and sale of our products to end user customers will be conducted by future licensees of our technology. Consequently, commercial success of our products will depend, to a great extent, on the efforts of others. We may not be able to identify, maintain or establish appropriate relationships in the future. We can give no assurance that these third parties will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them. In addition, these third parties may require customization of our designs or provide other concessions that could reduce the potential profitability of these relationships. Failure to develop favorable licensing relationships in our target markets will adversely affect our commercialization schedule and to the extent we enter into such relationships, the failure of our licensees to focus adequate resources on selling our products or be successful in selling them or to meet their monetary obligations to us, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA material part of our success depends on our ability to manage third-party resources. Our failure to properly select, manage and retain qualified third-party resources could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers.\nOur development efforts are highly dependent on third-party resources for semiconductor expertise and manufacturing. These third-party resources include experts in power semiconductor switches, semiconductor fabrication suppliers and other resources within the power switch ecosystem. The loss of one or more of our third-party consultants could have a material adverse effect on the timing of our development efforts which could, in turn, result in our business and results of operations being adversely affected. We also rely on our semiconductor fabrication partners to develop prototype devices. There can be no assurance that these manufacturing partners will provide devices in a timely and cost-efficient manner, provide quality devices or otherwise meet our needs and expectations. Our ability to manage such relationships and timely replace such partners, if necessary, is critical to our success. Our failure to timely replace consultants, fabrication partners and other suppliers within the power switch ecosystem, should that become necessary, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers.\nWe will need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nAs our technology is in the development stage and has not yet been commercialized, we will be required to obtain additional financing to continue our operations and execute our business plan. Even in the event we complete the planned sale of our power conversion systems division in the near term, we will still need to raise additional capital within the next twelve to fifteen months from the date of issuance of this report to fund our future operations. We may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain such financing when needed, our business could fail. Our independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our 2018 financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will continue to incur significant costs as we develop and commercialize our B-TRAN\u2122 technology. Although we are executing our business plan to commercialize and license this technology, continuing losses may impair our ability to fully meet our business objective or threaten our ability to continue as a going concern in future years. Any such inability to continue as a going concern may result in our stockholders losing their entire investment. There is no guarantee that we will begin generating revenue or secure additional financing on acceptable terms.\nA failure to obtain government grants could have a material adverse effect on our development efforts and our ability to fund operations and execute on our business plan.\nWe expect to fund a portion of our development efforts with funds received under government grants. However, we may not be awarded any such grants, any such grant awards may be insufficient to fund a meaningful portion of our development spending and/or the timing of the receipt of any such award or awards may not coincide with the planned timing of our development efforts. Grants are subject to long procurement cycles, typically 6 to 12 months, and there may not be open grant solicitations for topics relevant to our B-TRAN\u2122 technology. Grant topics are typically identified 1 to 2 years prior to the opening of the grant solicitation and the windows to submit proposals are discrete time periods. Further, the award of grants is a subjective process and government agencies often do not provide detailed feedback on why a grant was not received.\nOther factors that could negatively impact our ability to obtain government grants is that our technology is still in a relatively early stage of development. If grant agencies determine that our technological readiness is not sufficiently advanced for a funded demonstration incorporating B-TRAN\u2122 or potential partners determine that our technological readiness is not sufficient to partner with us on grant proposals, we may be unable to obtain government grants. Overall, there is a high degree of uncertainty in obtaining grants, particularly for technologies that have not been demonstrated with device samples, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain government grants to offset a significant, or any, portion of our development spending. If we do not obtain grants or our efforts to obtain grants take longer than expected to be successful, we will need to rely on other means to fund our development.\nThe macro-economic environment in the United States and abroad has adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our ability to raise capital, which may potentially impact our ability to continue our operations.\nWe have and, prior to commercialization at scale, will continue to rely on raising funds from investors to support our research and development activities and our operations. Macro-economic conditions in the United States and abroad may result in a tightening of the credit markets and/or less capital available for small public companies, which may make it more difficult to raise capital. If we are unable to raise funds as and when we need them, we may be forced to curtail our operations or even cease operating altogether.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of key members of our management team. Our inability to retain these individuals could impede our business plan and growth strategies, which could have a negative impact on our business and the value of your investment.\nOur ability to implement our business plan depends, to a critical extent, on the continued efforts and services of key members of our management team. If we lose the services of any of these persons during this important time in our development, the loss may result in a delay in the implementation of our business plan and plan of operations. We can give no assurance that we could find satisfactory replacements for these individuals on terms that would not be unduly expensive or burdensome to us. We do not currently carry a key-man life insurance policy that would assist us in recouping our costs in the event of the death or disability of any of these persons.\nIn addition, we will need additional semiconductor expertise as we draw closer to the commercialization of our technology. We can give no assurance that we will be able to identify and secure the necessary expertise at the appropriate time or at all.\nOur operating results for any quarterly reporting period may fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and pace of our development spending and costs to commercialize our technology.\nOur research and development costs and, in the future, our other operating costs may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the current phase of development and commercialization of our technology and the timing of both semiconductor prototype and commercial production and negotiations with potential strategic partners. We also may intentionally accelerate our development costs or may be faced with unexpected delays or challenges with development that could significantly impact our operating results. Significant adverse fluctuations in our operating costs from period to period could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nAny failure to sell our power conversion systems division in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOn January 2, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a plan to suspend further power converter system development and sales while we located a buyer for our power conversion systems division. If we fail to sell this division in a timely manner for consideration and at sales terms consistent with our expectations, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nNew technologies in the power semiconductor switch industry may supplant our technology in this market, which would harm our business and operations, and we may not be able to compete effectively in this industry and with any such new technologies.\nThe power semiconductor switch industry is subject to significant technological change. Our future success will depend on the cutting-edge relevance of our technology, and thereafter on our ability to appropriately respond to changing technologies and changes in function of products and quality. If new technologies supplant our technology, our business would be adversely affected and we will have to revise our plan of operation. We or our licensees could be competing against large power semiconductor device suppliers with substantially greater resources than us. If any of our competitors develop products to compete with our technology, we may not be able to commercialize our technology and our technology may not result in sufficient, or any, licensing revenue. Our potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial and marketing resources than we do.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe public market for our common stock may be volatile. This may affect the ability of our investors to sell their shares as well as the price at which they sell their shares.\nThe market price for the shares may be significantly affected by factors such as variations in the volume of trading activity, quarterly and yearly operating results, general trends in markets we expect to serve, and changes in state or federal regulations affecting us and our industry. Furthermore, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. Such broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have the right to issue, and have in the past issued, shares of preferred stock. If we were to issue additional preferred stock, it may have rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time-to-time by our board of directors. Our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights, and other rights, preferences and privileges for the preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the preferred stock, could reduce the voting rights and powers of the common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in the book value per share of the common stock we are offering. The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, to the detriment of the investors in the common stock offered hereby. We cannot assure you that we will not, under certain circumstances, issue shares of our preferred stock. At December 31, 2018, we had 1,518,430 shares of non-voting preferred stock outstanding.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay dividends.\nWe plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to market our products and to cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of being a public company that reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission and our management is required to devote substantial time to meet compliance obligations.\nAs a public company reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC that impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel are required to devote a substantial amount of time to these and other new compliance initiatives. In addition, we believe these rules and regulations may make it more costly for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage in the future. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf we are unable to regain compliance with the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for you to sell your shares.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value of publicly-held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholder's equity, among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from the Nasdaq.\nOn September 7, 2018, we received a notice letter from the Listing Qualifications staff of Nasdaq indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, we no longer meet the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), Nasdaq provided us with a period of 180 calendar days, or until March 6, 2019, in which to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period.\nOn March 7, 2019, we received a notice letter from Nasdaq indicating that we had not regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. However, Nasdaq determined that we were eligible for an additional 180-day period, or until September 3, 2019, to regain compliance based on the fact that we met the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and we provided written notice to Nasdaq of our intent to cure the deficiency during this second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nIf we choose to implement a reverse stock split in order to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, we must complete the split no later than 10 business days prior to September 3, 2019 in order to timely regain compliance. If we do not regain compliance by September 3, 2019, the Staff indicated that it will provide written notification to us that our common stock will be delisted. At that time, we may appeal the Staff\u2019s delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (\u201cPanel\u201d). Our common stock would remain listed pending the Panel\u2019s decision. There can be no assurance that, if we do appeal any delisting determination by the Staff to the Panel, that such appeal would be successful.\nThere can also be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. If we do regain compliance with the Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements for The NASDAQ Stock Market, or that our common stock will not be delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market in the future. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, in which case our common stock could be delisted notwithstanding our ability to demonstrate compliance with the minimum bid price requirements.\nDelisting from The NASDAQ Stock Market may adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities. If we are delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market and we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the \"pink sheets.\" As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that our common stock is a \"penny stock\" which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and little or no analyst coverage for us;\n\u00b7 we would no longer qualify for exemptions from state securities registration requirements, which may require us to comply with applicable state securities laws; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form registration statements on Form S-3) or obtain additional financing in the future.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had 14,014,410 shares of common stock outstanding and 1,518,430 shares of preferred stock outstanding. Shares beneficially owned by our affiliates, if any, and employees are subject to volume and other restrictions under Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act, various vesting agreements, our insider trading policy and/or any applicable 10b5-1 trading plan. Shares that are not beneficially owned by our affiliates and employees generally can be freely sold in the public market, subject in some cases to restrictions under Rule 144.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had 8,794,900 potentially dilutive shares outstanding and we may grant additional options, stock-based awards and/or warrants in the future. If our stock price rises, the holders of vested options, stock-based awards or warrants may exercise their options, stock-based awards and/or warrants and sell a large number of shares. Any sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, or Certificate, and bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. The provisions in our Certificate and bylaws:\n\u2022 authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;\n\u2022 limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022 do not permit stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022 do not provide for cumulative voting rights; and\n\u2022 provide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may limit our ability to engage in any business combination with a person who beneficially owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock unless certain conditions are satisfied. This restriction lasts for a period of three years following the share acquisition. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock. See \u201cAnti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of Delaware Law and Our Charter Documents\u201d for additional information.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. Historically, a number of securities analysts published reports on us on a regular basis but this number has declined over the last year and, in general, the ratings of these analysts on our common stock has become less favorable. If any of the analysts who cover us now or in the future issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 14313, "SIC": 3620, "TIC": "IPWR"}
