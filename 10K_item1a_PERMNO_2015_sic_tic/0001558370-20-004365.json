{"cik": "84129", "company": "RITE AID CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFactors Affecting our Future Prospects\nSet forth below is a description of certain risk factors which we believe may be relevant to an understanding of us and our business. Security holders are cautioned that these and other factors may affect future performance and cause actual results to differ from those which may be anticipated. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 could further exacerbate many of the risk described below or described elsewhere herein. See the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nWidespread health developments, including the global COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and the markets in which we have stores or otherwise operate. This pandemic, as well as the reality or fear of any other adverse public health developments, has impacted and could further adversely and materially affect, among other things, our workforce, operations, stores, and supply chain, and the operations of our customers, suppliers and business partners. The local, national and international response to the virus is quickly developing, fluid and uncertain. Responses have included voluntary and in some cases, mandatory quarantines as well as shut downs and other restrictions on travel and commercial, social, medical and other activities, and declarations of emergencies. Such measures have contributed to the sudden increase in the unemployment rate and changes in customer spending. Any such negative impact could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nIn response to the spread of COVID-19, we have modified certain of our business practices (including store hours and access, employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates, customers, suppliers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be negatively impacted. Further, the initiatives we have implemented to slow and/or reduce the impact of COVID-19 and the related support programs we have put in place for our associates and customers have in some instances, increased our operating expenses and reduced the efficiency of our operations. There can be no assurance that a continued effect of COVID-19 will not impact the measure we have taken to reduce costs.\nWe have incurred additional costs to ensure we meet the safety and needs of our associates and customers, including the installation of Plexiglas shields at pharmacy and front-end counters to provide additional protection, providing additional cleaning materials for our stores and other facilities, and focusing on home delivery and digital services. In addition, we have enhanced certain employee benefits and compensation for those on the front-line. We\nexpect to continue to incur additional costs, which may be significant, as we continue to implement operational changes in response to this pandemic.\nCOVID-19 may also cause supply chain disruption which could result in higher supply chain costs to replenish inventory in our stores and distribution centers. In addition, we may experience shortages in our generic drug supplies due to replenishment delays resulting from COVID-19, which could result in the substitution of generic drugs with brand drugs, which generally have a lower profit margin. Furthermore, we have experienced and may continue to experience restricted stock availability in a number of categories, which may cause is to change our purchasing decisions across many categories, and we cannot assure you whether we these delays or difficulty sourcing certain products will continue, which could negatively impact us.\nFurther, our management is focused on mitigating COVID-19, which has required and will continue to require, a large investment of time and resources across the company and may delay other value added services. COVID-19 or any other adverse public health developments could inhibit or delay our ability to execute our strategic initiatives, including, without limitation (i) improving our pharmacy benefit management business, (ii) redefining the role of our pharmacists, including bringing pharmacists front and center and out from behind the counter, (iii) updating our retail and digital experience; (iv) the roll-out of our future store concept, merchandising changes and rebranding efforts; and (v) our plan to increase the sales volume and profitability of our existing brands. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on our business may be impacted by the costs of treatment of COVID-19, unemployment, and the related effects on customer insurance coverage caused by governmental actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 or other adverse public health developments, including reduced demand for acute medication.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business depends on numerous evolving factors, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and are outside of our control, including new information which may quickly emerge concerning the severity of the virus, the scope of the outbreak and the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and the disruption, volatility in the global capital markets, which may increase the cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, among others. As a result, the impact on our financial and operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the impact could be material. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 could further exacerbate the impact of the other risk factors contained in this and the other reports the Company files with the SEC.\nWe are highly leveraged. Our substantial indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary.\nWe had, as of February 29, 2020, approximately $3.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness and stockholders\u2019 equity of $674.5 million. We also had additional borrowing capacity under our $2.7 billion senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d or \u201crevolver\u201d) of $1,940.0 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of approximately $110.0 million. Subsequent to February 29, 2020, we drew additional amounts under our revolver to ensure that we have ample cash on hand. We continue to have remaining availability under our revolver.\nOur high level of indebtedness will continue to restrict our operations. Among other things, our indebtedness will:\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the markets in which we compete;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n\u25cf limit our ability to reinvest in our business;\n\u25cf render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions; and\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt.\nOur ability to meet our cash requirements, including our debt service obligations, is dependent upon our ability to maintain our operating performance, which will be subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our cash requirements and debt service obligations.\nWe believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures through fiscal 2021 and have no significant debt maturities prior to April 2023. However, if our operating results, cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates rise significantly, we could face liquidity constraints. Additionally, we improved our leverage and liquidity position this past year by selling our rights in our calendar 2019 Medicare Part D final reconciliation payment. There can be no assurance that we will enter into a similar transaction for our calendar 2020 payment, or that if we do so, that the terms of such transaction will differ, and such differences could be material. If we are unable to service our debt or experience a significant reduction in our liquidity, we could be forced to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures and other initiatives, sell assets, restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity capital, or need to change certain elements of our strategy, and we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on the financial markets and the economy may make it more difficult to consummate any such transaction, or result in terms that are less favorable to us. Our existing debt agreements limit our ability to take certain of these actions. Our failure to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay our debts or refinance our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on us.\nBorrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are based upon variable rates of interest, which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates.\nBorrowings under our senior secured credit agreement, dated as of December 20, 2018 (as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of January 6, 2020, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), consisting of a $2,700.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (\u201cSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a $450.0 million \u201cfirst-in, last out\u201d senior secured term loan facility (\u201cSenior Secured Term Loan\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cExisting Facilities\u201d) bear interest at a rate that varies depending on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). If LIBOR rises, the interest rates on borrowings under our Existing Facilities will increase. Therefore an increase in LIBOR, even after giving effect to our hedge activities, would increase our interest payment obligations under those borrowings and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition.\nFurther, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021 and it is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will evolve. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on future indebtedness may be adversely affected or we may need to renegotiate the terms of our Existing Facilities to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established, if any, or to otherwise agree with the trustees or agents on a new means of calculating interest.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our current indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our current indebtedness limit our ability to:\n\u25cf incur debt and liens;\n\u25cf pay dividends;\n\u25cf make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock;\n\u25cf make loans and investments;\n\u25cf prepay, redeem or repurchase debt;\n\u25cf engage in acquisitions, consolidations, asset dispositions, sale-leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions;\n\u25cf change our business;\n\u25cf amend some of our debt and other material agreements;\n\u25cf issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u25cf restrict distributions from subsidiaries; and\n\u25cf grant negative pledges to other creditors.\nThe Credit Agreement has a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 (i) on any date on which availability under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is less than $200.0 million, or (ii) on the third consecutive business day on which availability under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is less than $250.0 million and, in each case, ending on and excluding the first day thereafter, if any, which is the 30th consecutive calendar day on which availability under the revolver is equal to or greater than $250 million. As of February 29, 2020, we had availability under our revolver of approximately $1,940.0 million, our fixed charge coverage ratio was greater than 1.00 to 1.00, and therefore, we were in compliance with the Credit Agreement\u2019s financial covenant. The Credit Agreement also limits our ability to maintain cash, without repaying a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, above a specified amount. For additional details, see the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Continuing Operations-Future Liquidity\u201d.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nWe need to improve our operations in order to improve our financial condition, but our operations will not improve if we cannot effectively implement our business strategy or if our strategy is negatively affected by worsening economic conditions.\nWe have not yet achieved the sales productivity level of our major competitors. We believe that improving the sales of existing stores is important to improving profitability and operating cash flow. If we are not successful in implementing our strategies, including our efforts to increase sales and further reduce costs, or if our strategies are not effective, we may not be able to improve our operations. A prolonged impact of COVID-19 may also make it more difficult to implement our strategies or cause a delay in such implementation. In addition, if we are unable to meet our obligations under the TSA, we would be exposed to significant financial penalties. Furthermore, any adverse change or weakness in general economic conditions or major industries can adversely affect drug benefit plans and reduce our pharmacy sales. Adverse changes in general economic conditions, including those resulting from COVID-19, such as increased unemployment, could affect consumer buying practices and consequently reduce our sales of front-end products, and cause a decrease in our profitability. Failure to improve operations or weakness in major industries or general economic conditions would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and our ability to make principal or interest payments on our debt.\nWe purchase all of our brand and generic drugs from a single wholesaler. A disruption in this relationship may have a negative effect on us.\nWe purchase all of our brand drugs and, with limited exceptions, all of our generic drugs from a single wholesaler, McKesson. Because McKesson acts as a wholesaler for drugs purchased from manufacturers worldwide, any disruption in the supply of a given drug, including disruptions related to COVID-19b, including supply shortages of key ingredients, or regulatory actions by domestic or foreign governmental agencies, or specific actions taken by drug manufacturers, could adversely impact McKesson\u2019s ability to fulfill our demands, which could adversely affect us. Pharmacy sales represented approximately 67.0% of our total drugstore sales during fiscal 2020. While we believe that\nalternative sources of supply for most generic and brand name pharmaceuticals are readily available, a significant disruption in our relationship with McKesson could result in disruptions to our business until we execute a replacement wholesaler agreement or develop and implement self-distribution processes. We believe we could obtain qualified alternative sources, including through self-distribution, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, and accordingly that the impact of any disruption would be temporary, although the impact of COVID-19 could make it more challenging to find a suitable replacement on our then desired timeline. On December 19, 2018, we and McKesson entered into a binding letter of intent that will continue our pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution partnership for an additional ten years. Under the terms, McKesson will continue providing us with sourcing and direct-to-store delivery for brand and generic pharmaceutical products through March 2029.\nRecent significant changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team, and the resulting management transitions could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of any such persons could have a material effect on our business. We have recently experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team. In 2019, we named several new key leaders, including a new President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President and Human Resources Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Pharmacy Officer, and in 2020, a new Executive Vice President of Retail. These types of management changes have the potential to disrupt our operations due to the operational and administrative inefficiencies, added costs, increased likelihood of turnover, and the loss of personnel with vital institutional knowledge, experience and expertise, which could result in significant disruptions to our operations. In addition, we must successfully integrate the new executive leadership team members within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in key leadership positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new leadership becomes familiar with our business. We are currently engaging in these activities primarily on a work from home basis as a result of COVID-19.\nA significant disruption in our computer systems or a cyber security breach could adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems, including those used by EnvisionRx, RediClinic, and Health Dialog, to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, inventory replenishment and other processes. Our systems have been subject to attack by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information. These sorts of attacks could subject our systems to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber security breaches, vandalism, coordinated cyber security attacks, severe weather conditions, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Although we deploy an information security program designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches through a multi-layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities, including ones from a cyber security standpoint, a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. Moreover, a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure, and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. We could also be adversely impacted by any significant disruptions in the systems of third parties we interact with, including key payors and vendors. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or our data could also result in a violation of applicable privacy, information security, and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, fines or lawsuits, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. Although we maintain cyber security insurance, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance program will be adequate to protect us against future claims. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business,\ncompliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. Additionally, we are in the process of changing our omni-channel distribution. There can be no assurance that we will be able to implement this technology on its intended timeline or that it will achieve its intended benefits.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technology, and we may accept new forms of payment over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers and associates, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation.\nThrough our sales and marketing activities, we collect and store certain personal information that our customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on our web site, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. We also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business. We may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, security could be compromised and confidential customer or business information misappropriated, for which we have paid related penalties in the past. Loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, compliance with more rigorous privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.\nRisks Related to the Retail Pharmacy and PBM Industries in which we Operate\nThe markets in which we operate are very competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us.\nWe face intense competition with local, regional and national companies, including other drugstore chains, independently owned drugstores, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, dollar stores and internet pharmacies. Competition from on-line retailers has significantly increased during the past few years. Some of our competitors have or may merge with or acquire pharmaceutical services companies, PBMs, health insurance companies, mail order facilities or enter into strategic partnership alliances with wholesalers or PBMs, which may further increase competition. We may not be able to effectively compete against them because our existing or potential competitors may have financial and other resources that are superior to ours. We also face competition from other PBMs, including large, national PBMs, PBMs owned by national health plans and smaller standalone PBMs. Certain of these competitors entered into the PBM industry before us, and there is no assurance that we will successfully compete with entities with more established PBM businesses. Further, we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are more highly leveraged than our competitors. The\nability of our stores to achieve profitability depends on their ability to achieve a critical mass of loyal, repeat customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to effectively compete in our markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased competition, or that any of our competitors are not in a better position to absorb the impact of COVID-19.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBMs, have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power, which has contributed to continued pricing pressures. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services and/or reduce our access to customers. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices and/or reduce our access to customers, our business will become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants we engage with, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our new strategy also includes selective acquisition opportunities and we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nThe availability of pharmacy drugs is subject to governmental regulations.\nThe continued conversion of various prescription drugs, including potential conversions of a number of popular medications, to over-the-counter medications may reduce our pharmacy sales and customers may seek to purchase such medications at non-pharmacy stores. Also, if the rate at which new prescription drugs become available slows or if new prescription drugs that are introduced into the market fail to achieve popularity, our pharmacy sales may be adversely affected. Additionally, we cannot assure you that the historic approval time for new drugs will not be impacted by the FDA\u2019s priorities in response to COVID-19. The withdrawal of certain drugs from the market or concerns about the safety or effectiveness of certain drugs or negative publicity surrounding certain categories of drugs may also have a negative effect on our pharmacy sales or may cause shifts in our pharmacy or front-end product mix.\nChanges in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs and changes in industry pricing benchmarks could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSales of prescription drugs reimbursed by third party payors, including the Medicare Part D plans and state sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies, represented substantially all of our pharmacy sales in our Retail Pharmacy segment in fiscal 2020.\nThe continued efforts of the Federal government, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBM companies, other State and local government entities, and other third-party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation relating to how drugs are priced, may impact our profitability. These efforts may be increased as a result of increased deficits or sudden losses as a result of the impact of COVID-19. In addition, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict or exclude our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers. Any significant loss of third-party business could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In particular, there has been a growth in the number of preferred Medicare Part D networks, many of which we are excluded from participating in. Decreased reimbursement payments to retail and mail order pharmacies for brand and generic drugs has caused a reduction in our profit. Historically, the effect of this trend has been mitigated by our efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers. Additionally, it has resulted in us providing contractual financial performance guarantees to certain of our PBM clients with respect to minimum drug price discounts for our retail pharmacy network and mail order pharmacy. Any inability to achieve guaranteed minimum drug price discounts provided to our PBM clients could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace Average Wholesale Price (\u201cAWP\u201d), which is the pricing reference used for many of our PBM client contracts, pharmaceutical manufacturer rebate agreements, retail pharmacy network contracts, specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments. Future changes to the use of AWP or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs and/or other payors, could impact the reimbursement we receive from Medicare programs and Medicaid health plans, the reimbursement we receive from PBM clients and other payors and/or our ability to negotiate rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers, acquisition discounts with wholesalers and retail discounts with network pharmacies. The effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time.\nDuring the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation, licensing and audits at both the federal and state levels. Efforts to control health care costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuing at the federal and state government levels. Changing political, economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices. A change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering lower reimbursement rates could negatively impact our profitability. Additionally, significant changes in legislation, regulation and government policy could significantly impact our business and the health care and retail industries. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take, specific proposals discussed during and after the election that could have a material adverse effect on our business include, but are not limited to, the repeal of all or part of the ACA and other significant changes to health care system legislation as well as changes with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries.\nThe repeal of all or part of the ACA, significant changes to Medicaid funding or even significant destabilization of the Health Insurance Marketplaces could impact the number of Americans with health insurance and, consequently, prescription drug coverage. Even if the ACA remains, significant provisions of the ACA have not yet been finalized (e.g., nondiscrimination in health programs and activities, excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage) and it is uncertain whether or in what form these provisions will be finalized. We cannot predict the effect, if any, a repeal of all or part of the ACA, the implementation or failure to implement the outstanding provisions of the ACA, or the enactment of new health care system legislation to replace current legislation may have on our retail pharmacy, LTC pharmacy and pharmacy services operations.\nA substantial portion of our pharmacy revenue is currently generated from a limited number of third party payors, and, if there is a loss of, or significant change to prescription drug reimbursement rates by, a major third party payor, our revenue will decrease and our business and prospects could be adversely impacted.\nA substantial portion of our pharmacy revenue is currently generated from a limited number of third party payors. While we are not limited in the number of third party payors with which we can do business and results may vary over time, our top five third party payors accounted for 79.9%, 80.4% and 78.6% of our pharmacy revenue during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The largest third party payor, Caremark, represented 28.8%, 28.3% and 27.2% of pharmacy sales during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect that a limited number of third party payors will continue to account for a significant percentage of our pharmacy revenue, and the loss of all or a portion of, or a significant change to customer access or prescription drug reimbursement rates by, a major third party payor could decrease our revenue and harm our business.\nA substantial portion of our Pharmacy Services segment revenue is currently generated from a limited number of customers, and, if there is a loss of a major customer, our revenue will decrease and our business and prospects could be adversely impacted.\nA substantial portion of our Pharmacy Services segment revenue is currently generated from a limited number of customers. While we are not limited in the number of customers with which we can do business and results may vary over time, our top five customers accounted for 53.2%, 49.3% and 40.7% of our Pharmacy Services segment revenue during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The largest payor, CMS, represented 27.4%, 23.0% and 17.3% of\nPharmacy Services segment revenue during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our Pharmacy Services segment revenue, and the loss of all or a portion of a major customer could decrease our revenue and harm our business.\nWe are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, we are a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings relating to opioids.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements; our noncompliance or a significant regulatory change could adversely affect our business, the results of our operations or our financial condition.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. Changes in these regulations may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including: (i) suspension of payments from government programs; (ii) loss of required government certifications; (iii) loss of authorizations or changes in requirements for participating in, or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (iv) loss of licenses; or (v) significant fines or monetary penalties. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, federal, state and local registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable Medicare and Medicaid Regulations; the HIPAA; regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances; regulations enforced by the U. S. Federal Trade Commission, the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws and federal and state laws governing the practice of the profession of pharmacy. We are also governed by federal and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of wage and hour laws, working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity.\nAdditionally, Congress passed the ACA in 2010, which resulted in significant structural changes to the health insurance system. However, in December 2017, the individual mandate was repealed. If the individual mandate repeal or a rollback of other aspects of the ACA, such as Medicaid expansion, actually leads to a significant reduction in demand for the healthcare services, the demand for our pharmacy services businesses may decline and could have a material impact on our business. Therefore, we cannot predict what effect, if any, the repeal of all or part of the ACA or any subsequent replacement legislation may have on our retail pharmacy and pharmacy services businesses.\nCertain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services; our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us.\nPharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. In addition, federal and state laws that\nrequire our pharmacists to offer counseling, without additional charge, to customers about medication, dosage, delivery systems, common side effects and other information the pharmacists deem significant can impact our business. Our pharmacists may also have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential negative effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate these effects. Although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance, from time to time, claims result in the payment of significant amounts, some portions of which are not funded by insurance. We cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims, or that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liability for which we self-insure or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission.\nWe may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause injury, illness or death.\nProducts that we sell could become subject to contamination, product tampering, mislabeling or other damage requiring us to recall our products. In addition, errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell and we may be obligated to recall our products. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks of declining gross margins in the PBM industry could adversely impact our profitability.\nThe PBM industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices, performance guarantees, enhanced service offerings and higher rebate yields. With respect to rebate yields, we maintain contractual relationships with brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our mail order pharmacy (all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients). Manufacturer rebates often depend on a PBM\u2019s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements, including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer\u2019s products on the PBM\u2019s formularies. If we lose our relationship with one or more pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Further, changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions, rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, or to formulary management or other PBM services could also reduce the manufacturer rebates we receive.\nWe also maintain contractual relationships with participating pharmacies that provide for discounts on retail transactions for generic drugs and brand drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network. If we lose our relationship with one or more of the larger pharmacies in our network, or if the retail discounts provided by network pharmacies decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing, including our ability to collect network administration and technology fees, could adversely impact our profitability.\nThe possibility of PBM client loss and/or the failure to win new PBM business could impact our ability to secure new business.\nOur PBM business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members. PBM client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration, so approximately one third of a PBM\u2019s client base typically is subject to renewal each year. In some cases, however, PBM clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract. In addition, the reputational impact of a service-related incident could negatively affect our ability to grow and retain our client base. Further, the PBM industry has been impacted by consolidation activity that may continue in the future. In the event one or more of our PBM clients is acquired by an entity that obtains PBM services from a competitor, we may be unable to retain all or a portion of our clients\u2019 business. Because of the competitive nature of the business, we continually face challenges in competing for new PBM business and retaining or renewing our existing PBM business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure\nrenewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms. These circumstances, either individually or in the aggregate, could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nRegulatory or business changes relating to our participation in Medicare Part D, the loss of Medicare Part D eligible members, or our failure to otherwise execute on our strategies related to Medicare Part D, may adversely impact our business and our financial results.\nOne of our subsidiaries, EIC, is an insurer domiciled in Ohio (with Ohio as its primary insurance regulator) and licensed in all 50 states, and is approved to function as a Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan (\u201cPDP\u201d) plan sponsor for purposes of individual insurance products offered to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries and for purposes of making employer/union-only group waiver plans available for eligible clients. We also provide other products and services in support of our clients\u2019 Medicare Part D plans or the Federal Retiree Drug Subsidy program. We are working to minimize the working capital tied to the business by reducing and/or selling the receivable as we did for calendar 2019, however there are no assurances that we can reduce or sell the receivable for calendar 2020. There are many uncertainties about the financial and regulatory risks of participating in the Medicare Part D program and we can give no assurance that these risks will not materially adversely impact our business and financial results in future periods.\nEIC is subject to various contractual and regulatory compliance requirements associated with participating in Medicare Part D. EIC is subject to certain aspects of state laws regulating the business of insurance in all jurisdictions in which EIC offers its PDP plans. As a PDP sponsor, EIC is required to comply with Federal Medicare Part D laws and regulations applicable to PDP sponsors. Additionally, the receipt of Federal funds made available through the Part D program by us, our affiliates, or clients is subject to compliance with the Part D regulations and established laws and regulations governing the Federal government\u2019s payment for healthcare goods and services, including the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act. Similar to our requirements with other clients, our policies and practices associated with operating our PDP are subject to audit. If material contractual or regulatory non-compliance was to be identified, monetary penalties and/or applicable sanctions, including suspension of enrollment and marketing or debarment from participation in Medicare programs, could be imposed. Further, the adoption or promulgation of new or more complex regulatory requirements associated with Medicare may require us to incur significant costs which could adversely impact our business and our financial results.\nIn addition, due to the availability of Medicare Part D, some of our employer clients may decide to stop providing pharmacy benefit coverage to retirees, instead allowing the retirees to choose their own Part D plans, which could cause a reduction in demand for our Medicare Part D group insurance products. Extensive competition among Medicare Part D plans could also result in the loss of Medicare Part D members by our managed care customers, which would also result in a decline in our membership base. For example, if we were to lose our current Star rating with the CMS, fewer customers may select our plans, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Like many aspects of our business, the administration of the Medicare Part D program is complex. Any failure to execute the provisions of the Medicare Part D program may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As discussed above, in March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform was enacted into federal law through the passage of the ACA. Additionally, as described above, the ACA contains various changes to the Part D program and could have a financial impact on our PDP and our clients\u2019 demand for our other Part D products and services. Further, it is unclear what effect, if any, the repeal of all or part of the ACA may have on the Part D program.\nFailure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns, an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers, or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services.\nThe success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty, superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to purchase products in additional categories and our private label brands. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns, an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers, or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services.\nWe offer our customers private label brand products that are available exclusively at our stores and through our online retail site. The sale of private label products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls, our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties, and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, market and sell private-label products. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, an increase in the sales of our private label brands may negatively affect our sales of national-branded products which consequently, could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships. Our ability to locate qualified, economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements, and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner, is critical to ensuring, among other things, that customer confidence is not diminished. Any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty.\nMoreover, customer expectations and new technology advances from our competitors have required that our business evolve so that we are able to interface with our retail customers not only face-to-face in our stores but also online and via mobile and social media. Our customers are using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online, as well as to provide public reactions concerning each facet of our operation. If we fail to keep pace with dynamic customer expectations and new technology developments, our ability to compete and maintain customer loyalty could be adversely affected.\nFinally, EnvisionRx\u2019s specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients. As a result, the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories. Any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 46922, "SIC": 5912, "TIC": "RAD"}
