Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider and evaluate these risk factors, as any of them could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which, in turn, can adversely affect the price of our securities.\nWe face significant competition in our asset liquidation business.\nOur asset liquidation business depends on our ability to successfully obtain a continuous supply of auction or appraisal contracts, or distressed and surplus assets for profitable resale to third parties. In this regard, we compete with numerous other organizations, some of which are much larger and better-capitalized, with greater resources available for both asset acquisition and associated marketing to potential customers. Additionally, some competitors have a longer history of activity in the asset liquidation business, and may have advantages with respect to accessing both deals and capital.\nOur asset liquidation business is subject to inventory risk and credit risk.\nUnder our business model, when not acting solely as an auctioneer, we assume the general and physical inventory and credit risks associated with purchasing assets for subsequent resale. Although we do enter into transactions for which a subsequent purchaser has already been identified, in most cases we purchase assets and assume the risk that they may sell for less than our forecasted price. As well, we may miscalculate demand or resale value, and subsequently sell the assets for less than their original purchase price. Either situation could have a material adverse effect upon our use of working capital and our results of operations.\nOur operating results are subject to significant fluctuation.\nOur revenue and operating results are subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the nature of the asset liquidation business, which involves discrete deals of varying size that are very difficult to predict. The timing of revenue recognition related to significant transactions can materially affect quarterly and annual operating results. Despite the accompanying variability of direct asset liquidation costs, quarterly fixed costs that are largely composed of salaries and benefits could exceed our gross profit. There can therefore be no assurance that we can achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with managing growth.\nSince the establishment of our asset liquidation business in 2009, we have experienced significant growth. This has occurred through the acquisitions of Equity Partners in 2011, HGP in 2012 and NLEX in 2014, as well as through the expansion of our operations to Europe during 2012. This growth requires an increased investment in personnel, systems and facilities. In the absence of continued revenue growth, the Company\u2019s operating margins could decline from current levels. Additional acquisitions will be accompanied by such risks as exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired businesses, unexpected acquisition expenses, greater than anticipated investments in personnel, systems and facilities, the expense of integrating new and existing operations, diversion of senior management resources, and dilution to existing shareholders. Failure to anticipate and manage these risks could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.\nA portion of our asset liquidation business is conducted through Joint Ventures.\nConducting business through Joint Ventures, as described above under \u201cIndustry and Competition,\u201d allows us to participate in significantly larger deals than those we could fund independently. If we ceased entering into Joint Ventures, or our Joint Venture partners decide not to partner with us, the pool of potential transactions would be reduced. Further, upon entering into Joint Ventures, we become exposed to the uncertainties of the activities of our partners. This could negatively impact our ability to obtain a continuous supply of assets for resale, and could have a material adverse effect upon our use of working capital and our results of operations.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nDuring 2012, we expanded our operations to the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d), Spain, and Germany. Our UK operations are conducted in pounds sterling (\u00a3) and our Spain and Germany operations are conducted in euros (\u20ac), rather than in U.S. dollars. To date we have been required to use funds generated by our US operations to meet a portion of European obligations as they come due. We thereby incur exchange rate risk. We conduct some of our asset liquidation transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange risk. Although this risk has not had a material impact on our business and operations to date, failure to anticipate and continue to manage this risk could have a material adverse effect.\nThe auction portion of our asset liquidation business may be subject to a variety of additional costly government regulations.\nMany states and other jurisdictions have regulations governing the conduct of traditional \u201cauctions\u201d and the liability of traditional \u201cauctioneers\u201d in conducting auctions, which may also apply to online auction services. In addition, certain states have laws or regulations that expressly apply to online auction services. We expect to continue to incur costs in complying with these laws and could be subject to fines or other penalties for any failure to comply with these laws. We may be required to make changes in our business to comply with these laws, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenue, and cause us to prohibit the listing of certain items, or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or operating results.\nCertain categories of merchandise that we sell are subject to government restrictions.\nWe sell merchandise, such as scientific instruments, that is subject to export control and economic sanctions laws, among other laws, imposed by the United States and other governments. Such restrictions include the U.S. Export Administration regulations, the International Traffic in Arms regulations, and economic sanctions and embargo laws administered by the Office of the Foreign Assets Control regulations. These restrictions prohibit us from, among other things, selling property to (1) persons or entities that appear on lists of restricted or prohibited parties maintained by the United States or other governments or (2) countries, regimes, or nationals that are the target of applicable economic sanctions or other embargoes.\nWe may incur significant costs or be required to modify our business to comply with these requirements. If we are alleged to have violated any of these laws or regulations we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with U.S. federal government agencies. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us, whether or not true.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d).\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our 2012 expansion into Europe has increased the risk of non-compliance with the FCPA. Failure to comply with the FCPA could subject the Company to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur asset liquidation business is subject to environmental risk.\nOur asset liquidation business at times includes the purchase and resale of buildings and land. Although our purchase process includes due diligence to determine that there are no material adverse environmental issues, it is possible that such issues could be discovered subsequent to a completed purchase. Any remediation and related costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon key personnel.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the knowledge, skills and performance of several of our executive officers, particularly our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer/President, President of NLEX, and Senior Managing Director of Equity Partners. The loss of any of these officers could damage key relationships and result in the loss of essential information and expertise. As our operations expand, we will be required to hire additional employees, and may face competition for them. Therefore, either the loss of the services of the above existing officers, or the inability to attract and retain appropriately skilled new employees, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.\nWe may require additional financing in the future, which may not be available, or may not be available on favorable terms.\nWe may need additional funds to finance the operations of our asset liquidation business, to make additional investments, or to acquire complementary businesses or assets. We may be unable to generate these funds from our operations. If funds are not available, or not available on acceptable terms, we could experience a material adverse effect upon our business.\nProvisions in our Articles of Incorporation, as amended, could prevent or delay stockholders' attempts to replace or remove current management.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended, provide for staggered terms for the members of our Board. The Board is divided into three staggered classes, and each director serves a term of three years. At an annual stockholders\u2019 meeting, only those directors comprising one of the three classes will have completed their term and stand for re-election or replacement. These provisions may\ntend to preserve our current management and the Board in a hostile tender offer, and may have an adverse impact on stockholders who may want to participate in such a tender offer, or who may want to replace some or all of the members of the Board.\nOur Board of Directors may issue additional shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $10.00 par value per share. The Board is authorized to determine the rights and preferences of any additional series or class of preferred stock. The Board may, without stockholder approval, issue shares of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that are senior to our shares of common stock or that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the existing holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock or common stock. The issuance of additional shares of preferred stock may also hamper or discourage an acquisition or change in control of HGI.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common stock and preferred stock and pay debt obligations with our common and preferred stock that may diminish our investors\u2019 pro rata ownership and depress our stock price.\nWe reserve the right to make future offers and sales, either public or private, of our securities including shares of our preferred stock, common stock or securities convertible into common stock at prices differing from the price of the common stock previously issued. In the event that any such future sales of securities are affected or we use our common or preferred stock to pay principal or interest on our debt obligations, an investor\u2019s pro rata ownership interest may be reduced to the extent of any such issuances and, to the extent that any such sales are effected at consideration which is less than that paid by the investor, the investor may experience dilution and a diminution in the market price of the common stock.\nThere is a limited public trading market for our common stock; the market price of our common stock has been volatile and could experience substantial fluctuations.\nOur common stock is currently traded in the OTC market in the United States and has a limited public trading market in the United States. Our common stock is traded on the Canadian Securities Exchange, and the market there is similarly limited. Without an active trading market, there can be no assurance regarding the liquidity or resale value of the common stock. In addition, the market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Such price fluctuations may be affected by general market price movements or by reasons unrelated to our operating performance or prospects such as, among other things, announcements concerning us or our competitors, technological innovations, government regulations, and litigation concerning proprietary rights or other matters.\nWe may not be able to utilize income tax loss carryforwards.\nRestrictions in our ability to utilize income tax loss carry forwards have occurred in the past due to the application of certain changes in ownership tax rules in the United States. There is no certainty that the application of these rules may not recur. In addition, further restrictions of, reductions in, or expiration of net operating loss and net capital loss carry forwards may occur through future merger, acquisition and/or disposition transactions or through failure to continue a significant level of business activities. Any such additional limitations could require us to pay income taxes in the future and record an income tax expense to the extent of such liability. We could be liable for income taxes on an overall basis while having unutilized tax loss carry forwards since these losses may be applicable to one jurisdiction and/or particular line of business while earnings may be applicable to a different jurisdiction and/or line of business. Additionally, income tax loss carry forwards may expire before we have the ability to utilize such losses in a particular jurisdiction and there is no certainty that current income tax rates will remain in effect at the time when we have the opportunity to utilize reported tax loss carry forwards.\nWe have not declared any dividends on our common stock to date and have no expectation of doing so in the foreseeable future.\nThe payment of cash dividends on our common stock rests within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, unencumbered cash, capital requirements and our financial condition, as well as other relevant factors. To date, we have not paid dividends on our common stock nor do we anticipate that we will pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015, we do not have any preferred stock outstanding that has any preferential dividends.\nWe may fail to either adequately protect our proprietary technology and processes, or enforce our intellectual property rights.\nThe Company\u2019s VoIP Patent Portfolio consists of United States Patents No. 6,243,373 and No. 6,438,124. The ultimate value of these patents has yet to be determined. If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate protections, or are unsuccessful in enforcing our patent rights, we may not be able to either realize additional value from our patents, or prevent third parties from benefiting from those patents without benefit to the Company. Any currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents. In\naddition, any issued patents may not have priority over any patent applications of others or may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies, products or processes. In addition, the Company\u2019s existing patents have finite lives (although they may be extended by filing continuations and/or divisional applications), most of which expire over the next three years. There is no guarantee that they will be fully exploited or commercialized before expiration.", "PERMNO": 78988, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "HGBL"}
