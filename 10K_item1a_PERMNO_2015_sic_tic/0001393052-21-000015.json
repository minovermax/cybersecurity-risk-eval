RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below and in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d together with all of the other information in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our Class A common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our Class A common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe below is a summary of principal risks to our business and risks associated with ownership of our stock. It is only a summary. You should read the more detailed discussion of risks set forth below and elsewhere in this report for a more complete discussion of the risks listed below and other risks.\n\u2022The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 may negatively impact our business and our stock price.\n\u2022If our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce or stop the use of our solutions, and we may incur significant liabilities.\n\u2022The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\u2022If our newer solutions are not successfully adopted by new and existing customers, the growth rate of our revenues and operating results will be adversely affected.\n\u2022We expect our revenue growth rates to decline in future periods and, as our costs increase, we may not be able to sustain the same level of profitability we have achieved in the past.\n\u2022Our revenues are relatively concentrated within a small number of key customers, and the loss of one or more of such key customers could cause our revenues to decline.\n\u2022Nearly all of our revenues are generated by sales to customers in the life sciences industry, and factors that adversely affect this industry could also adversely affect us.\n\u2022If the third-party providers of healthcare professional and healthcare organization data and prescription drug sales data do not allow our customers to upload and use such data in our solutions, the demand for our solutions may decrease, and our business may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022We rely on third-party providers for computing infrastructure, secure network connectivity, and other technology-related services needed to deliver our cloud solutions, and any disruption in the services provided by them could adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\n\u2022Because key and substantial portions of our multichannel CRM applications are built on salesforce.com\u2019s Salesforce Platform, we are dependent upon salesforce.com to provide these solutions to our customers and we are bound by the restrictions of our agreement with salesforce.com, which limits the markets to which we may sell our Veeva CRM solution.\n\u2022We are currently being sued by third parties for alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. We may suffer damages or other harm from these lawsuits and we may be sued for infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property in the future.\n\u2022Our conversion to a PBC may not result in the benefits that we anticipate, requires our directors to balance the interest of stockholders with other interests, and may subject us to legal uncertainty and other risks.\n\u2022Until its expiration on October 15, 2023, the dual-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain individuals and their affiliates, which will limit or preclude the ability of our investors to influence corporate matters.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 may negatively impact our business and our stock price.\nThe worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 has had and continues to have a widespread and unpredictable worldwide impact on our business operations, the life sciences industry, healthcare systems, financial markets, and the global economy. While the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance has not been materially negative to date, the future impact is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, government responses to the pandemic, the impact on our customers, the impact on our employees, the extent of further adverse impacts to the economy, and the scale and pace of economic recovery and resumption of normal business activities, all of which cannot be predicted with certainty.\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we have shifted most of our customer, employee, and industry events to virtual-only experiences for the remainder of our fiscal year ending January 31, 2022. We have also implemented employee travel restrictions and, as of the time of this filing, many of our U.S. offices, including our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California, remain closed with employees working from home. With respect to offices we have opened, we have generally offered employees the option to continue working from home and many employees have chosen to do so. Many of our customers have implemented similar measures, which may limit our ability to sell or provide professional services to them over time. Customers may delay or cancel purchasing decisions or professional services projects in light of uncertainties to their businesses arising from COVID-19 or renew their subscriptions at lower levels. In our fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, our recently acquired Crossix and Physicians World businesses were negatively impacted by COVID-19, and sales to certain other customer segments were and may continue to be negatively impacted as well, including sales to cosmetics companies. We may also experience requests from customers for lengthened payment terms or less favorable billing terms that could adversely impact our financial performance. Such requests to date have not been significant but may increase in the future. Due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of COVID-19, and any impact to our sales efforts, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all.\nCertain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting changes in business practice may be enduring over the long term and may result in significant changes in business practice within the technology industry, the life sciences industry, and the world economy generally. For example, the extent to which remote work will remain common practice or become increasingly prevalent after the COVID-19 pandemic ends is not certain and may have significant impacts on hiring practices, management practices, expense structures and investments, and other aspects of our business and the businesses of our customers. Similarly, the extent to which virtual meetings and interactions continue to be used or preferred in lieu of in-person interactions may significantly change business practices for us and our customers, and, in turn, may impact demand for our products and services. For example, if our customers reduce sales representatives in response to an increasing preference for virtual meetings with doctors, demand for our core CRM application may decline. We expect life sciences companies to reduce the number of sales representatives that they employ by roughly 10% over the next one to two years, which could negatively impact sales of our solutions, including Veeva CRM and other Commercial Cloud applications in particular, but we cannot be certain such reductions will happen or of the timing or magnitude of such reductions. At the same time, demand for our products that enable virtual interactions with doctors and clinical trial participants may increase. We cannot accurately predict how such changes may impact Veeva's results over the long term.\nIn addition, the stock market has been unusually volatile during certain periods of the COVID-19 pandemic and such volatility may continue. During certain early periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, our stock price declined significantly, and such declines may happen again.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce or stop their use of our solutions, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur solutions involve the storage and transmission of our customers\u2019 proprietary information (including personal or identifying information regarding their employees and the medical professionals whom their sales personnel contact, and sensitive proprietary data related to the clinical trial, regulatory submission and sales and marketing processes for medical treatments), personal information of medical professionals, personal information (which may include personal health information) of patients and clinical trial participants, and other sensitive information. For example, Veeva Crossix processes third-party health and non-health data for U.S. patients. Unauthorized access or security breaches, as a result of third-party action (e.g., cyber-attacks), employee error, product defect, malfeasance, or\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\notherwise, could result in the loss of information, inappropriate use of or access to information, service interruption, service degradation, outages, service level credits, litigation, indemnity obligations, damage to our reputation, and other liability. We believe our risk of cyber-attack may be elevated during the COVID-19 outbreak due to an increase in cyber-attack attempts on U.S. businesses generally. While we maintain and continue to improve our security measures, we may be unable to adequately anticipate security threats or to implement adequate preventative measures, in part, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target. Moreover, the detection, prevention, and remediation of known or unknown securities vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software in our supply chain, may result in additional direct or indirect costs and management time. Any or all of these issues could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect to not renew their subscriptions, result in reputational damage, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines, mandatory disclosures, or other action or liability, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover losses associated with such events, and such insurance may not cover all of the types of costs, expenses, and losses we could incur to respond to and remediate a security breach. A security breach of another significant provider of cloud-based solutions may also negatively impact the demand for our solutions.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe markets for our solutions are highly competitive. In new sales cycles within our largest product categories, we generally compete with other cloud-based solutions from providers that make applications geared toward the life sciences industry. The principal such competitor for our Veeva Commercial Cloud applications is IQVIA Inc., which offers a CRM application built on the Salesforce1 Platform, various data products, and other applications. A significant Veeva CRM customer recently launched a project to implement IQVIA's competitive software offering for portions of its CRM users. The scope of that deployment may expand, resulting in further losses of revenue within our Veeva CRM business, or we may lose additional Veeva CRM users or customers in the future. Our data and data analytics products, including Veeva OpenData, Veeva Link, Veeva Crossix, and Veeva Data Cloud, compete with IQVIA and smaller data and data analytics providers. No single vendor offers products that compete with all of our Veeva Vault applications, but IQVIA, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, OpenText Corporation, Oracle Corporation, and other smaller application providers offer applications that compete with certain of our Veeva Vault applications. Our Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault application suites also compete to replace client server-based legacy solutions offered by companies such as Oracle, Microsoft Corporation, and other smaller application providers. Our customers may also choose to use cloud-based applications or platforms that are not life sciences specific-such as Box.com, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft-for certain of the functions our applications provide. Our business consulting and professional services offerings compete with a range of professional services firms, including at times some of our partners. With the introduction of new technologies, we expect competition to intensify in the future, and we may face competition from new market entrants as well.\nSome of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and business recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios, and agreements with a broader set of system integrators and other partners. We also continue to be subject to litigation from our competitors. For example, as disclosed elsewhere in this report, we are in active litigation with IQVIA and Medidata.\nIf our competitors\u2019 products, services, or technologies become more accepted than our solutions, if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than we are, if their products or services are more technologically capable than ours, or if customers replace our solutions with custom-built software, then our revenues could be adversely affected. Pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses, or a failure to maintain or improve our competitive market position, any of which could adversely affect our business. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete favorably against our current and future competitors.\nIf our newer solutions are not successfully adopted by new and existing customers, the growth rate of our revenues and operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth and profitability will depend on our ability to successfully develop and sell new solutions. It is uncertain whether these newer solutions will continue to grow as a percentage of revenues at a pace significant enough to support our expected overall growth. For example, we have limited experience selling our Veeva Data\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nCloud offering for longitudinal patient and prescriber data, our MyVeeva for Patients solution that will enable remote patient interactions for clinical trials, or our MyVeeva for Doctors solution that will facilitate more efficient communications between health care practitioners and life sciences companies. We cannot be certain that we will be successful with respect to newer solutions and markets. It may take us significant time, and we may incur significant expense, to effectively market and sell these solutions, develop other new solutions, or make enhancements to our existing solutions. If our newer solutions do not continue to gain traction in the market, or other solutions that we may develop and introduce in the future do not achieve market acceptance in a timely manner, the growth rate of our revenues and operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur revenues are relatively concentrated within a small number of key customers, and the loss of one or more of such key customers, or their failure to renew or expand user subscriptions, could slow the growth rate of our revenues or cause our revenues to decline.\nIn our fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our top 10 customers accounted for 36%, 36%, and 39% of our total revenues, respectively. We rely on our reputation and recommendations from key customers in order to promote our solutions to potential customers, which we call \u201creference selling.\u201d The loss of any of our key customers, or a failure of one or more of them to renew or expand user subscriptions for some or all our products, could have a significant impact on the growth rate of our revenues, our reputation, and our ability to obtain new customers. In the event of an acquisition of one of our customers or a business combination between two of our customers, we have in the past and may in the future suffer reductions in user subscriptions or non-renewal of certain or all of their subscription orders. We are also likely to face increasing purchasing scrutiny at the renewal of large customer subscription orders, which may result in reductions in user subscriptions or increased pricing pressure. The business impact of any of these negative events could be particularly pronounced with respect to our largest customers.\nAn inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly skilled employees. Competition for these employees is intense, especially with respect to software engineers with high levels of experience in enterprise software and internet-related services and sales personnel. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with the appropriate level of qualifications, and we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, intense recruitment of our employees by competitors and other technology companies. With respect to sales professionals, even if we are successful in attracting highly qualified personnel, it may take six to nine months or longer before they are fully trained and productive. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may offer compensation packages that are perceived to be better than ours. For example, we offer equity awards to a substantial majority of our job candidates and existing employees as part of their overall compensation package. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, including as a result of declines in the market price of our Class A common stock or changes in perception about our future prospects, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. Additionally, changes in our compensation structure may be negatively received by employees and result in attrition or cause difficulty in the recruiting process. If we fail to attract new employees or fail to retain and motivate our current employees, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nDefects or disruptions in our solutions could result in diminished demand for our solutions, a reduction in our revenues, and subject us to substantial liability.\nWe have from time to time found defects in our solutions, and new defects may be detected in the future. In addition, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions, degradations, outages, and other performance problems. These types of problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including human or software errors, viruses, cyber-attacks, fraud, spikes in customer usage, problems associated with our third-party computing infrastructure and network providers, infrastructure changes, and denial of service issues. Service disruptions may result from errors we make in delivering, configuring, or hosting our solutions, or designing, installing, expanding, or maintaining our computing infrastructure. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It is also possible that such problems could result in losses of customer data.\nSince our customers use our solutions for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions, service degradations, or other performance problems with our solutions, could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. If that occurs, our customers may delay or withhold payment to us, cancel their\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nagreements with us, elect not to renew, or make service credit claims, warranty claims, or other claims against us, and we could lose future sales. The occurrence of any of these events could result in diminishing demand for our solutions, a reduction of our revenues, an increase in our bad debt expense or in collection cycles for accounts receivable, or could require us to incur the expense of litigation or substantial liability.\nWe have experienced rapid growth, and if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and expansion of our operations. Our revenues, customer count, product and service offerings, countries of operation, facilities, and computing infrastructure needs have all increased significantly, and we expect them to increase in the future. We have also experienced rapid growth in our employee base. As we continue to grow, both organically and through acquisitions, we must effectively integrate, develop, and motivate an increasing number of employees (an increasing portion of whom are permanent remote employees), while executing our growth plan and maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees and to achieve our business objectives.\nOur rapid growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management capabilities, administrative and operational infrastructure, facilities, IT, and other resources. We anticipate that additional investments in our computing infrastructure and facilities will be required to scale our operations. To effectively manage growth, we must continue to improve our key business applications, processes, and computing infrastructure; enhance information and communication systems; and ensure that our policies and procedures evolve to reflect our current operations and are appropriately communicated to and observed by employees. These enhancements and improvements will require additional investments and allocation of valuable time, effort, and expense. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in deploying our solutions, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties could adversely impact our business performance and results of operations.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have in the past acquired and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, solutions, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our solutions, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, in November 2019, we acquired Crossix, a provider of privacy-safe patient data and data analytics, and Physicians World, a provider of speakers bureau services for healthcare professionals. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are completed.\nWe have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. We may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel, operations, and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;\n\u2022costs, liabilities, or accounting charges associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022difficulty integrating the privacy, data security, and accounting systems, operations, and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u2022difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our solutions and contract terms, including due to disparities in the revenue, licensing, support, or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\n\u2022problems arising from differences in applicable accounting standards or practices of the acquired business (for instance, non-U.S. businesses may not be accustomed to preparing their financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP), or difficulty identifying and correcting deficiencies in the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired business;\n\u2022adverse effects to business relationships with our existing business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022difficulty in retaining key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022use of substantial portions of our available cash for the acquisition;\n\u2022use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business;\n\u2022significant changes beyond our control to the worldwide economic environment that could negatively impact our underlying assumptions and expectations for performance of the acquired business, including, for example, the effect of COVID-19 on the Crossix and Physicians World businesses; and\n\u2022the possibility of investigation by, or the failure to obtain required approvals from, governmental authorities on a timely basis, if at all, under various regulatory schemes, including competition laws, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, subject the transaction to divestiture after the fact, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of the acquisition.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business, and financial position may suffer.\nMoreover, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired intangible assets and goodwill, which we must assess for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions may also result in purchase accounting adjustments, write-offs or restructuring charges, which may negatively affect our results.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable investment of resources. If our sales cycle lengthens or we invest substantial resources pursuing unsuccessful sales opportunities, our operating results and growth would be harmed.\nOur sales process entails planning discussions with prospective customers, analyzing their existing solutions, and identifying how these potential customers could use and benefit from our solutions. The sales cycle for a new customer, from the time of prospect qualification to the completion of the first sale, may span 12 months or longer. Sales cycles for our newer applications or in newer markets or industries are also lengthy and difficult to predict. We spend substantial time, effort, and expense in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will result in the sale of our solutions. In addition, our sales cycle can vary substantially from customer to customer because of various factors, including the discretionary nature of potential customers\u2019 purchasing and budget decisions, the announcement or planned introduction of new solutions by us or our competitors, and the purchasing approval processes of potential customers. If our sales cycle lengthens or we invest substantial resources pursuing unsuccessful sales opportunities, our operating results and growth would be harmed.\nCatastrophic events could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Pleasanton, California and our third-party hosted computing infrastructure is located in the United States, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. The west coast of the United States, Japan and South Korea each contain active earthquake zones. Additionally, we rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems, and our website, for our development, marketing, operational support, hosted services, and sales activities. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane, actual or threatened public health emergency (e.g., COVID-19), or other catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, we may be unable to continue our operations at full capacity or at all and may experience system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our solution development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security, loss of key employees, and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nWithin Veeva Commercial Cloud, our core Veeva CRM application has achieved substantial market penetration within pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. If our efforts to sustain or further increase the use and adoption of our core CRM application do not succeed, the growth of our Veeva Commercial Cloud revenues may be negatively impacted.\nIn our fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we derived approximately 51% of our subscription services revenues and approximately 49% of our total revenues from our Veeva Commercial Cloud solutions. A significant percentage of our Veeva Commercial Cloud subscription services revenues are derived from subscriptions for our core CRM application, and we have realized substantial sales penetration among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for our core Veeva CRM application. If we are not able to sell additional user subscriptions for our core CRM application, if we fail to renew existing subscriptions for our core CRM application, or if subscription levels for our core CRM application are reduced at renewal (as a result of reductions in sales representatives that use our solutions, change in demand for our solutions, or for other reasons), the growth of our Veeva Commercial Cloud revenues may be negatively impacted. We expect life sciences companies to reduce the number of sales representatives that they employ by roughly 10% over the next one to two years, which could negatively impact sales of Veeva CRM and other Commercial Cloud applications in particular, but we cannot be certain such reductions will happen or of the timing or magnitude of such reductions.\nChanges in our senior management team or other key personnel could have a negative effect on our ability to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in a large part upon the continued service of our senior management team or other key personnel. In particular, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Peter P. Gassner, is critical to our vision, strategic direction, culture, products, and technology. We do not maintain key-man insurance for Mr. Gassner or any other member of our senior management team. In addition, in the past several years we have experienced changes to our senior leadership team. Such leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and an unsuccessful transition may cause disruption to our business. In addition, change in the senior management team may create uncertainty among investors and employees or candidates concerning Veeva\u2019s future direction and performance. Any disruption in our operations or uncertainty around our ability to execute could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with the professional or technical support services provided by us or our partners.\nOur business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers, both with respect to our solutions and the professional services that are performed in connection with the implementation of our solutions, including training our customers' employees on our solutions. Professional services may be performed by us, by a third party, or by a combination of the two. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, we may be required to issue credits or refunds for pre-paid amounts related to unused services, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer\u2019s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to expand the number of solutions subscribed to by that customer. Moreover, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.\nOnce our solutions are deployed, our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our solutions. We may be unable to sufficiently accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for technical support services to our customers' satisfaction. Increased customer demand for our technical support services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our solutions and business and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business and operating results.\nSales to customers outside the United States or with international operations expose us to risks inherent in international sales.\nIn our fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, customers outside North America accounted for approximately 44% of our total revenues. A key element of our growth strategy is to further expand our international operations and\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nworldwide customer base. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the United States. We have limited operating experience in some international markets, and we cannot assure you that our expansion efforts into additional international markets will be successful. Our experience in the United States and other international markets in which we already have a presence may not be relevant to our ability to expand in other markets. Our international expansion efforts may not be successful in creating further demand for our solutions outside of the United States or in effectively selling our solutions in the international markets we enter. In addition, we face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022the need and expense to localize and adapt our solutions for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and ensuring that our solutions enable our customers to comply with local laws and regulations;\n\u2022data privacy and data sovereignty laws which require that customer data be stored and processed in a designated territory;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022different pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles, and collections issues;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition;\n\u2022weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States, and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022laws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including those related to employment, tax, privacy, data protection, and anti-bribery;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds or difficulties in repatriating funds without adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022adverse tax consequences, including the potential for required withholding taxes;\n\u2022fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency in which our foreign revenues or expenses may be denominated;\n\u2022changes in diplomatic relations and trade policy, including the status of relations between the United States and China, and the implementation of or changes to trade sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes;\n\u2022public health crises, such as epidemics and pandemics, including COVID-19; and\n\u2022unstable regional and economic political conditions in the markets in which we operate.\nSome of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur estimate of the market size for our solutions we have provided publicly may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market size is accurate, we cannot assure you that our business will serve a significant portion of the market.\nOur estimate of the market size for our solutions that we have provided publicly, sometimes referred to as total addressable market (TAM), is subject to significant uncertainty and is based on assumptions and estimates, including our internal analysis and industry experience, which may not prove to be accurate. These estimates are, in part, based upon the size of the general application areas we target. Our ability to serve a significant portion of this estimated market is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. For example, in order to address the entire TAM we have identified, we must continue to enhance and add functionality to our existing solutions and introduce new solutions. Accordingly,\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\neven if our estimate of the market size is accurate, we cannot assure you that our business will serve a significant portion of this estimated market for our solutions.\nRisks Related to the Principal Industry We Serve\nNearly all of our revenues are generated by sales to customers in the life sciences industry, and factors that adversely affect this industry, including mergers within the life sciences industry or regulatory changes, could also adversely affect us.\nNearly all of our sales are to customers in the life sciences industry. Demand for our solutions could be affected by factors that affect the life sciences industry, including:\n\u2022The changing regulatory environment of the life sciences industry-Changes in regulations could negatively impact the business environment for our life sciences customers. Healthcare laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and may change significantly in the future. In particular, legislation or regulatory changes regarding the pricing of drugs and other healthcare treatments sold by life sciences companies has continued to be a topic of discussion by political leaders and regulators in the United States and elsewhere.\n\u2022Consolidation of companies within the life sciences industry-Consolidation within the life sciences industry has accelerated in recent years, and this trend could continue. We have in the past, and may in the future, suffer reductions in user subscriptions or non-renewal of customer subscription orders due to industry consolidation. We may not be able to expand sales of our solutions and services to new customers enough to counteract any negative impact of company consolidation on our business. In addition, new companies that result from such consolidation may decide that our solutions are no longer needed because of their own internal processes or alternative solutions. As these companies consolidate, competition to provide solutions and services will become more intense and establishing relationships with large industry participants will become more important. These industry participants may also try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our solutions. If consolidation of our larger customers occurs, the combined company may represent a larger percentage of business for us and, as a result, we are likely to rely more significantly on revenue from the combined company to continue to achieve growth. In addition, if large life sciences companies merge, it would have the potential to reduce per-unit pricing for our solutions for the merged companies or to reduce demand for one or more of our solutions as a result of potential personnel reductions over time.\n\u2022Bankruptcy within the life sciences industry-Life sciences companies, and in particular early-stage companies with pre-commercial treatments in clinical trials, may be unsuccessful and may subsequently declare bankruptcy. If our customers declare bankruptcy or otherwise dissolve, they may terminate their agreements with us or we may not be able to recoup the full payment of fees owed to us.\n\u2022Changes in market conditions and practices within the life sciences industry-The expiration of key patents, the implications of precision medicine treatments, changes in the practices of prescribing physicians and patients, changes with respect to payer relationships, the policies and preferences of healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations with respect to the sales and marketing efforts of life sciences companies, changes in the regulation of the sales and marketing efforts and pricing practices of life sciences companies, and other factors such as the impact of COVID-19, could lead to a significant reduction in sales representatives that use our solutions or otherwise change the demand for our solutions. We expect life sciences companies to reduce the number of sales representatives that they employ by roughly 10% over the next one to two years, which could negatively impact sales of our solutions, including Veeva CRM and other Commercial Cloud applications in particular. We cannot be certain such reductions will happen or of the magnitude of such reductions. Changes in public perception regarding the practices of the life sciences industry may result in political pressure to increase the regulation of life sciences companies in one or more of the areas described above, which may negatively impact demand for our solutions.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\n\u2022Changes in global economic conditions and changes in the global availability of healthcare treatments provided by the life sciences companies to which we sell-Our business depends on the overall economic health of our existing and prospective customers. The purchase of our solutions may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. If economic conditions, including the ability to market life sciences products in key markets or the demand for life sciences products globally deteriorates, many of our customers may delay or reduce their IT spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our solutions, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription duration and value, slower adoption of new product offerings, and increased price competition.\nAccordingly, our operating results and our ability to efficiently provide our solutions to life sciences companies and to grow or maintain our customer base could be adversely affected as a result of these factors and others that affect the life sciences industry generally.\nOur solutions address heavily regulated functions within the life sciences industry, and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could lessen the demand for our solutions or subject us to significant claims and losses.\nOur customers use our solutions for business activities that are subject to a complex regime of global laws and regulations, including requirements for maintenance of electronic records and electronic signatures, requirements regarding drug sample tracking and distribution, requirements regarding system validations, requirements regarding processing of health data, and other laws and regulations. Our customers expect to be able to use our solutions in a manner that is compliant with the regulations to which they are subject. Our efforts to provide solutions that comply with such laws and regulations are time-consuming and costly and include validation procedures that may delay the release of new versions of our solutions. As these laws and regulations change over time, we may find it difficult to adjust our solutions to comply with such changes.\nIn addition, many countries and self-regulatory bodies impose requirements regarding payments and transfers of value from life sciences companies to healthcare professionals. For example, our current and prospective customers may be required to comply with the U.S. federal legislation commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, and its implementing regulations (Sunshine Act). The Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the government information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians. Our solutions and services targeted at life sciences companies, including, for example, Veeva Digital Events, are used by our customers to assist with their reporting obligations under the Sunshine Act. If our solutions and services fail to assist our customers to meet such reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner, demand for our solutions could decrease, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs we increase the number of products we offer and the number of countries in which we operate, the complexity of adjusting our solutions to comply with legal and regulatory changes will increase. If we are unable to effectively manage this increased complexity or if we are not able to provide solutions that can be used in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, customers may be unwilling to use our solutions, and any such non-compliance could result in the termination of our customer agreements or claims arising from such agreements with our customers. Furthermore, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to inspections or audits by government agencies or other regulatory bodies to verify our customers\u2019 compliance with applicable laws, regulations, or GxP principles.\nAdditionally, any failure of our customers to comply with laws and regulations applicable to the functions for which they use our solutions could result in investigations by regulatory authorities, fines, penalties, or claims for substantial damages against our customers that may, in turn, harm our business or reputation. If such failure were allegedly caused by our solutions or services, our customers may make a claim for damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for the failure. We may be subject to investigations and lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could divert our resources and our management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our business and customer relationships, and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover such claims against us.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nIncreasingly complex data protection and privacy regulations are burdensome, may reduce demand for our solutions, and non-compliance may impose significant liabilities.\nOur customers use our solutions to collect, use, process, store, and disclose personal data or identifiable information regarding their employees, healthcare professionals, and patients (including potentially sensitive data such as health data). In many countries, governmental bodies have adopted or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, processing, storage, and disclosure of personal data, making compliance an increasingly complex task.\nFor example, in the United States, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated privacy and security rules under HIPAA that cover protected health information (PHI) by limiting use and disclosure and giving individuals the right to access, amend, and seek accounting of their PHI. Certain of our customers may be either business associates or covered entities under HIPAA. For example, while HIPAA generally is not applicable to pharmaceutical companies, some of our customers are clinical research sites, such as university hospitals, and may provide healthcare service as well as clinical research and may be required to comply with HIPAA. Therefore, in certain scenarios, HIPAA is applicable to PHI that is introduced into our solutions, and we must maintain a HIPAA compliance program.\nVeeva Crossix provides analytics derived from de-identified third-party health and consumer data on U.S. residents that life sciences companies use for measurement of their advertising objectives. All PHI processed by Crossix for its measurement services is certified to satisfy HIPAA\u2019s de-identification standard. Certain states have signed into law or are intending to enact laws regarding requirements on de-identified information, and there is some uncertainty regarding those laws' conformity with the HIPAA de-identification standards. Compliance with state laws could require additional investment and management attention and may subject us to significant liabilities if we do not comply appropriately with new and potentially conflicting regulations.\nIn addition to government regulations, privacy advocates and other key industry players have established or may establish various new, additional, or different policies or self-regulatory standards, such as the prohibition of third-party cookies and other identifiers in certain digital environments that may place additional burdens or resource constraints on us, limit our ability to collect and use certain data, and limit our ability to generate certain analytics. Our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by third parties. Moreover, the continuing evolution of these standards might cause confusion for our customers and may have an impact on the solutions we offer, including our data products. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could reduce demand for our solutions and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nUnder the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), we are a service provider and business for our software solutions and data products, respectively. Several other states have signed into law or are intending to enact laws regarding requirements on personal information. There is also the potential for the U.S. federal government to pass data privacy laws. These regulations and legislative developments have potentially far-reaching consequences and may require us to modify our data management practices and to incur substantial expense in order to comply.\nUnder the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we act as a data controller for our data products, Veeva OpenData and Veeva Link, and a data processor with respect to our software solutions. Regarding data transfer, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and we now rely solely on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure that our European customers have the appropriate legal mechanisms in place for their personal data to be accessed within the United States. Management has spent considerable time and resources to respond to customer inquiries as a result of this decision. There is also a trend toward countries enacting data localization or other country specific requirements which could be problematic to cloud software providers. Understanding and implementing such country specific certifications on top of our internationally recognized security certifications could require additional investment and management attention and may subject us to significant liabilities if we do not comply with particular requirements. Compliance with global privacy laws has and will continue to require valuable management and employee time and resources, and failure to comply with these regulations could include severe penalties and could reduce demand for our solutions.\nCustomers expect that our solutions can be used in compliance with data protection and data privacy laws and regulations. The functional and operational requirements and costs of compliance with such laws and regulations may adversely impact our business, and failure to enable our solutions to comply with such laws and regulations\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\ncould lead to significant fines and penalties imposed by regulators, as well as claims by our customers or third parties. Additionally, all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or desire to collect, use, process, store, and disclose personal information and health data using our solutions, or to license data products from us, which could reduce demand for our solutions.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nIf the third-party providers of healthcare professional and healthcare organization data and prescription drug sales data do not allow our customers to upload and use such data in our solutions, the demand for our solutions may decrease and our business may be negatively impacted.\nMany of our customers license healthcare professional and healthcare organization data and data regarding the sales of prescription drugs from third parties such as IQVIA. In order for our customers to upload such data to the Veeva CRM, Veeva Network Customer Master, Veeva Nitro, and other Veeva applications, such third-party data providers typically must consent to such uploads and often require that we enter into agreements regarding our obligations with respect to such data, which include confidentiality obligations and intellectual property rights with respect to such third-party data. We have experienced delays and difficulties in our negotiations with such third-party data providers in the past, and we expect to experience difficulties in the future. For instance, IQVIA currently will not consent to customers using its healthcare professional or healthcare organization data being uploaded to Veeva Network Customer Master and this has negatively affected sales and customer adoption of Veeva Network Customer Master. To date, IQVIA has also restricted customers from uploading any of its data to Veeva Nitro, Veeva Andi, and certain other Veeva applications. Similarly, sales and customer adoption of Veeva OpenData has been negatively impacted by certain restrictions on the use of IQVIA data during customer transitions from IQVIA data to Veeva OpenData. If third-party data providers, particularly IQVIA, do not consent to the uploading and use of their data in our solutions, delay consent, or fail to offer reasonable conditions for the upload and use of their data in our solutions, our sales efforts, solution implementations, and productive use of our solutions by customers, which have been harmed by such actions in the past, may continue to be harmed. Restrictions on the ability of our customers to use third-party data in our solutions may also decrease demand for our solutions or may cause customers to consider purchasing solutions that are not subject to the same restrictions. For example, it has been reported that a significant Veeva CRM customer recently launched a project to implement IQVIA's competitive software offering for portions of its CRM users, in part as a result of concerns about restrictions imposed by IQVIA for the use of IQVIA data in certain Veeva software applications. If these third-party data limitations persist, our business may be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on third-party providers-including salesforce.com and Amazon Web Services-for computing infrastructure, secure network connectivity, and other technology-related services needed to deliver our cloud solutions. Any disruption in the services provided by such third-party providers could adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nOur solutions are hosted from and use computing infrastructure provided by third parties, including salesforce.com with respect to Veeva CRM and certain of our multichannel CRM applications, Amazon Web Services with respect to Veeva Vault applications, Veeva Network applications, and certain other Veeva Commercial Cloud applications, and, to a lesser extent, other computing infrastructure service providers.\nWe do not own or control the operation of the third-party facilities or equipment used to provide the services described above. Our computing infrastructure service providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transition to a new provider and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. In addition, such service providers could decide to close their facilities or change or suspend their service offerings without adequate notice to us. Moreover, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy, faced by such service providers may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. Since we cannot easily switch computing infrastructure service providers, any disruption with respect to our current providers would impact our operations and our business could be adversely impacted.\nProblems faced by our computing infrastructure service providers could adversely affect the experience of our customers. For example, salesforce.com and Amazon Web Services have experienced significant service outages in the past and may do so again in the future. Additionally, our failure to manage or react to an increase in customer demand could have an adverse effect on our business. A rapid expansion of our business or an increase in\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\ncustomer demand could affect our service levels or cause our systems to fail. Our agreements with third-party computing infrastructure service providers may not entitle us to corresponding service level credits to those we offer to our customers. Any changes in third-party service levels at our computing infrastructure service providers or any related disruptions or performance problems with our solutions could result in lengthy interruptions in our services, damage our customers\u2019 stored files, or result in potential losses of customer data, any of which could adversely affect our reputation. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenues, cause us to issue refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscriptions, subject us to service level credit claims and potential liability, or adversely affect our renewal rates.\nBecause key and substantial portions of our multichannel CRM applications are built on salesforce.com\u2019s Salesforce Platform, we are dependent upon salesforce.com to provide these solutions to our customers and we are bound by the restrictions of our agreement with salesforce.com, which limits the markets to which we may sell our Veeva CRM solution.\nOur Veeva CRM application and certain portions of the multichannel CRM applications that complement our Veeva CRM application are developed on or utilize the Salesforce Platform of salesforce.com, and we are dependent upon the continued use of the Salesforce Platform as combined with the proprietary aspects of our multichannel CRM applications.\nOur agreement with salesforce.com expires on September 1, 2025. However, salesforce.com has the right to terminate the agreement in certain circumstances, including in the event of a material breach of the agreement by us, or that salesforce.com is subjected to third-party intellectual property infringement claims based on our solutions (except to the extent based on the Salesforce Platform) or our trademarks and we do not remedy such infringement in accordance with the agreement. Also, if we are acquired by specified companies, salesforce.com may terminate the agreement upon notice of not less than 12 months. If salesforce.com terminates our agreement under these circumstances, our customers will be unable to access Veeva CRM and certain other of our multichannel CRM applications. A termination of the agreement would cause us to incur significant time and expense to acquire rights to, or develop, a replacement CRM platform, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Even if we were to successfully acquire or develop a replacement CRM platform, some customers may decide not to adopt the replacement platform and may decide to use a different CRM solution. If we were unsuccessful in acquiring or developing a replacement CRM platform or acquired or developed a replacement CRM platform that our customers do not adopt, our business, operating results and brand may be adversely affected.\nAlso, if either party elects not to renew the agreement at the end of its September 1, 2025 term or if the agreement is terminated by us as a result of salesforce.com\u2019s breach, the agreement provides for a five-year wind-down period in which we would be able to continue providing the Salesforce Platform as combined with the proprietary aspects of our solutions to our existing customers but would be limited with respect to the number of additional subscriptions we could sell to our existing customers. After the wind-down period, we would no longer be able to use the Salesforce Platform.\nOur agreement with salesforce.com provides that we can use the Salesforce Platform as combined with our proprietary Veeva CRM application to sell sales automation solutions only to drug makers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries for human and animal treatments, which does not include the medical device industry or products for non-drug departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Sales of the Salesforce Platform in combination with our Veeva CRM application to additional industries would require the review and approval of salesforce.com. Our inability to freely sell our Veeva CRM application outside of drug makers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may adversely impact our growth.\nWhile our agreement with salesforce.com, subject to certain exceptions including pre-existing arrangements, provides that salesforce.com will not position, develop, promote, invest in, or acquire applications directly competitive to the Veeva CRM application for sales automation that directly target drug makers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry or the pharma/biotech industry, our remedy for a breach of this commitment by salesforce.com would be to terminate the agreement, or continue the agreement but be released from our minimum order commitments from the date of salesforce.com\u2019s breach forward. While our agreement with salesforce.com also restricts salesforce.com from competing with us with respect to sales opportunities for sales automation solutions for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry unless such competition has been pre-approved by salesforce.com\u2019s senior management based on certain criteria specified in the agreement, and imposes certain limits on salesforce.com from entering into new arrangements after March 3, 2014 that are similar to ours with other parties with respect to sales automation applications for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nindustry, it does not restrict a salesforce.com customer\u2019s ability (or the ability of salesforce.com on behalf of a specific salesforce.com customer) to customize or configure the Salesforce Platform, and our remedy for a breach of these restrictions by salesforce.com would be to terminate the agreement, or continue the agreement but be released from our minimum order commitments from the date of salesforce.com\u2019s breach forward. Some current or potential customers of ours may choose to build custom solutions using the Salesforce Platform rather than buying our solutions.\nAlso, salesforce.com recently announced a strategic partnership with Alibaba, a Chinese company, through which Alibaba will become the exclusive provider of Salesforce in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. The timeframe and exact parameters of changes to salesforce.com offerings in the listed regions has not been announced. Our existing agreement with salesforce.com allows us to sell our CRM solutions to drug makers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, and our right to do so is not impacted by the Alibaba partnership. However, our ability to offer our CRM solutions from data centers located in the listed regions may be limited if salesforce.com does not operate data centers in the listed regions in the future and we do not contract for such data center services from Alibaba. If our inability to offer our CRM solutions from data centers located in the listed regions negatively impacts the performance of our solutions in those regions or causes legal compliance concerns, or if customers in the listed regions prefer their CRM solutions to be hosted from local data centers, our business may be negatively affected.\nWe employ third-party licensed software and software components for use in or with our solutions, and the inability to maintain these licenses or the presence of errors or security vulnerabilities in the software we license could limit the functionality of our products and result in increased costs or reduced service levels, which would adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our employment of the Salesforce Platform through our agreement with salesforce.com, our solutions incorporate or use certain third-party software and software components obtained under licenses from other companies. We also use third-party software and tools in the development process for our solutions to manage and monitor our computing infrastructure, and to provide professional services and support our customers. For example, our Veeva CRM Engage Meeting application uses a purpose-built partner tool from Zoom Video Communications, Inc., which is critical to the application's functionality. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to replace. In addition and although we maintain a supplier security evaluation process, if the third-party software we use has errors, security vulnerabilities, or otherwise malfunctions, the functionality of our solutions may be negatively impacted, our customers may experience reduced service levels, and our business may suffer.\nOur solutions utilize open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could adversely affect our business.\nOur solutions include software covered by open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our solutions. It is possible under the terms of certain open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, that we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and make our proprietary software available under open source licenses. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our solutions, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our solutions, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our solutions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could adversely affect our business.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nRisks Related to Our Financial Performance, How We Contract with Customers, and the Financial Position of Our Business\nOur historic growth rates of total revenues and subscription services revenues should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance.\nWhile we have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods, it is not indicative of our future revenue growth. We expect our longer-term revenue growth rate will decline. In our fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our total revenues grew by 33%, 28%, and 25%, respectively, as compared to total revenues from the prior fiscal years. In our fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our subscription services revenues grew by 32%, 29%, and 24%, respectively, as compared to subscription services revenues from the prior fiscal years. Please note that our total revenues and subscription services revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 only included revenue contribution from Crossix and Physicians World in the fourth quarter of that fiscal year. Our total revenues and subscription services revenue growth rates have declined in the past, and we expect them to decline again in the future. If we are unable to maintain consistent revenue growth, it may adversely impact our profitability and the value of our Class A common stock.\nOur results may fluctuate from period to period, which could prevent us from meeting our own guidance or security analyst or investor expectations.\nOur results of operations, including our revenues, gross margin, operating margin, profitability, cash flows, calculated billings, and deferred revenue, as well as other metrics we may report, may vary from period to period for a variety of reasons, including those listed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, our quarterly results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Additionally, from time to time, we issue guidance and provide commentary regarding our expectations for certain future financial results and other metrics on both a near-term and long-term basis. Our guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that are subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties that are beyond our control and are based upon assumptions about future business and accounting decisions that may change or be wrong. Our guidance may prove to be incorrect, and actual results may differ from our guidance. Fluctuations in our results or failure to achieve our guidance or security analyst or investor expectations, even if not materially, could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline substantially, and our investors could incur substantial losses.\nThe majority of our subscription agreements with our customers are for a term of one year. If our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, or do not buy additional solutions and user subscriptions from us, or renew at lower aggregate fee levels, our business and operating results will suffer.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from the renewal of existing subscription orders. The majority of our customers\u2019 orders for subscription services have one-year terms. However, more recently and with respect to solutions other than our core Veeva CRM application and particularly with respect to certain of our Vault applications, we have entered into a number of orders with multi-year terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after their orders expire. Thus, securing the renewal of our subscription orders and selling additional solutions and user subscriptions is critical to our future operating results. Factors that may affect the renewal rate for our solutions and our ability to sell additional solutions and user subscriptions include:\n\u2022the price, performance, and functionality of our solutions;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our professional services;\n\u2022the strength of our business relationships with our customers;\n\u2022the availability, price, performance, and functionality of competing solutions and services;\n\u2022our ability to develop complementary solutions, applications, and services;\n\u2022the stability, performance, and security of our hosting infrastructure and hosting services; and\n\u2022the business environment of our customers and, in particular, acquisitions of or business combinations between our customers or other business developments that may result in reductions in user subscriptions.\nIn addition, our customers may negotiate terms less advantageous to us upon renewal, which could reduce our revenues from these customers. As a customer\u2019s total spend on Veeva solutions increases, we expect purchasing\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nscrutiny at renewal to increase as well, which may result in reductions in user subscriptions or increased pricing pressure. Other factors that are not within our control may contribute to a reduction in our subscription services revenues. For instance, our customers may reduce their number of sales representatives, which would result in a corresponding reduction in the number of user subscriptions needed for some of our solutions and thus a lower aggregate renewal fee, or our customers may discontinue clinical trials for which our solutions are being used. If our customers fail to renew their subscription orders, renew their subscription orders with less favorable terms or at lower fee levels, or fail to purchase new solutions, applications, or professional services from us, our revenues may decline or our future revenues may be constrained.\nAs our costs increase, we may not be able to sustain the level of profitability we have achieved in the past.\nWe expect our future expenses to increase as we continue to invest in and grow our business. We expect to incur significant future expenditures related to:\n\u2022developing new solutions and enhancing our existing solutions, including additional data acquisition costs associated with our Veeva Data Cloud offering and investment in our product development teams;\n\u2022improving the technology infrastructure, scalability, availability, security, and support for our solutions;\n\u2022sales and marketing, including expansion of our direct sales organization and global marketing programs;\n\u2022expansion of our professional services organization;\n\u2022pending, threatened, or future legal proceedings, certain of which are described in Part I, Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and note 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements, and which we expect to continue to result in significant expense for the foreseeable future;\n\u2022international expansion;\n\u2022acquisitions and investments; and\n\u2022general operations, IT systems, facilities, and administration, including legal and accounting expenses.\nIf our efforts to increase revenues and manage our expenses are not successful, or if we incur costs, damages, fines, settlements, or judgments as a result of other risks and uncertainties described in this report, we may not be able to sustain or increase our historical levels of profitability.\nOur revenues and gross margin from professional services fees are volatile and may not increase from quarter to quarter or at all.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from professional services fees. Our professional services revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the requirements, complexity, and timing of our customers\u2019 implementation projects. Generally, a customer\u2019s ongoing need for professional services decreases as the implementation and full deployment of our solutions is completed. Our customers may also choose to use third parties rather than us for certain professional services related to our solutions. As a result of these and other factors, our professional services revenues may not increase on a quarterly basis in the future or at all. Additionally, the gross margin generated from professional services fees fluctuates based on a number of factors which may vary from period to period, including the average billable hours worked by our billable professional services personnel, our average hourly rates for professional services and the margin on professional services subcontracted to our third-party systems integrator partners. As a result of these and other factors, the gross margin from our professional services may not increase on a quarterly basis in the future or at all.\nBecause we recognize subscription services revenues ratably over the term of an order for our subscription services, it may be difficult to evaluate our future financial performance.\nWe generally recognize subscription services revenues ratably over the term of an order under our subscription agreements. As a result, a substantial majority of our quarterly subscription services revenues are generated from subscription agreements entered into during prior periods. Consequently, a decline in new subscriptions in any quarter may not affect our results of operations in that quarter but could reduce our revenues in future quarters. Additionally, the timing of renewals or non-renewals of a subscription agreement during any quarter may only affect our financial performance in future quarters. For example, the non-renewal of a subscription agreement late in a quarter will have minimal impact on revenues for that quarter but will reduce our revenues in future quarters.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nAccordingly, the effect of significant declines in sales and customer acceptance of our solutions may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations, which would make these reported results less indicative of our future financial results. By contrast, a non-renewal occurring early in a quarter may have a significant negative impact on revenues for that quarter and we may not be able to offset a decline in revenues due to the non-renewal with revenues from new subscription agreements entered into in the same quarter.\nAdditionally, with respect to certain of our multi-year orders in which fees increase from year to year, we recognize ratably the total contracted revenue for the entire multi-year term of the order. As a result, in the initial year of such orders, we will recognize more revenue than the fees we invoice for the same period, and in the last year of such orders, we will recognize less revenue than the fees we invoice for the same period. Moreover, such multi-year orders could renew at fees greater than the revenue that was recognized in the last year of the order, which could result in fluctuations in our financial results. We may also be exposed to impaired contract assets if, for example, a customer terminated an otherwise non-cancelable multi-year contract for cause. Therefore, our reported results could be less indicative of the actual health of our business at the time revenue is reported.\nDeferred revenue and change in deferred revenue may not be accurate indicators of our future financial results.\nOur subscription orders are generally billed at the beginning of the subscription period in annual or quarterly increments, which means the annualized value of such orders may not be completely reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Many of our customers, including many of our large customers, are billed on a quarterly basis and therefore a substantial portion of the value of contracts billed on a quarterly basis will not be reflected in our deferred revenue at the end of any given quarter. Also, particularly with respect to our Veeva Commercial Cloud orders, because the term of orders for additional end users or applications is commonly less than one year, the annualized value of such orders may not be completely reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. We have also agreed from time to time, and may agree in the future, to allow customers to change the renewal dates of their orders to, for example, align more closely with a customer\u2019s annual budget process or to align with the renewal dates of other orders placed by other entities within the same corporate control group, or to change payment terms from annual to quarterly, or vice versa. Such changes typically result in an order of less than one year to align all orders to the desired renewal date and, thus, may result in a lesser increase to deferred revenue than if the adjustment had not occurred. Additionally, changes in renewal dates may change the fiscal quarter in which deferred revenue associated with a particular order is booked. Accordingly, we do not believe that changes on a quarterly basis in deferred revenue, unbilled accounts receivable, or calculated billings, a metric commonly cited by financial analysts, are accurate indicators of the underlying momentum of our business or future revenues. We believe that our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full fiscal year are the best indicators of the momentum of our business or future revenues. Please note that we define the term calculated billings for any period to mean revenue for the period plus the change in deferred revenue from the immediately preceding period minus the change in unbilled accounts receivable from the immediately preceding period. However, many companies that provide cloud-based software report changes in deferred revenue or calculated billings as key operating or financial metrics, and it is possible that analysts or investors may view these metrics as important. Thus, any changes in our deferred revenue balances or deferred revenue trends, or in the future, our unbilled accounts receivable balances or trends, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added, or similar transactional taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value added or similar transactional taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales but no physical presence, based on our determination that such taxes are not applicable or that we are not required to collect such taxes with respect to the jurisdiction. Sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect and remit such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements, including based on changes in tax laws, may adversely affect our results of operations. We believe that our financial statements reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency, but there can be no assurances in that regard.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities, including as a result of our international operations or implementation of new tax rules, could harm our future results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions and complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in these jurisdictions. Tax rates may change as a result of factors outside of our control or relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. In addition, changes in tax and trade laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could have a material adverse effect on our tax position. Forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates. Moreover, increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability.\nOur tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles and changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) significantly changed how the U.S. Department of Treasury imposes income taxes on U.S. corporations. We made significant judgments and assumptions in the interpretation of this new law and in our calculations reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, on June 29, 2020, California Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bill No. 85 as part of the California 2020 Budget Act, which temporarily suspends the use of California net operating losses and imposes a limitation on the amount of business incentive tax credits that may impact our tax liabilities in future periods.\nAny changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions could also impact our tax liabilities. The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax rules, including changes to the practice of shifting profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. Additionally, certain countries in the European Union, as well as India, have enacted or are proposing various forms of non-income based taxes, such as a Digital Service Tax. Generally, such a tax is based on a percentage of gross revenue associated with digital service transactions. The increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nFinally, we have been, and may be in the future, subject to income tax audits throughout the world. We believe our income, employment, and transactional tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, but an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.\nCurrency exchange fluctuations may negatively impact our financial results.\nSome of our international agreements provide for payment denominated in local currencies, and the majority of our local costs are denominated in local currencies. As we continue to expand our operations in countries outside the United States, an increasing proportion of our revenues and expenditures in the future may be denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies may impact our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars. Thus, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan, and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our revenues and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars in the future. Further, we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.\nWe engage in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions and may, in the future, hedge selected significant transactions or net monetary exposure positions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal controls over financial reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our management report on internal controls over financial reporting be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm.\nWe must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting. If in the future we have any material weaknesses, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. Additionally, if in the future we are unable to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash balances and may not use them effectively.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash balances and may not use them effectively. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Pending their use, we may invest our cash balances in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. Our investments may not yield a favorable return to our investors and may negatively impact the price of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights or misappropriation of intellectual property, and we may suffer damages or other harm from such proceedings.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals including so-called non-practicing entities, or NPEs, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our solutions. From time to time, third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights or that we have misappropriated their intellectual property. For example, since January 2017, we have been defending against assertions of trade secret misappropriation made by our competitors, Medidata and IQVIA, as described in note 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. As competition in our market grows, the possibility of patent infringement and other intellectual property claims against us increases. In the future, we expect others to claim that our solutions and underlying technology infringe or violate their intellectual property rights. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services. Any claims or litigation have caused and in the future could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications, or refund fees, which could be costly. Any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations even if we were to ultimately prevail in such litigation.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. As of January 31, 2021, we have filed numerous domestic and foreign patent applications and have been issued 33 U.S. patents and 11 international patents. We also rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nlicense agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Negative publicity related to a decision by us to initiate such enforcement actions against a customer or former customer, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely impact our other customer relationships or prospective customer relationships, harm our brand and business, and could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand and our business.\nRisks Related to our Status as a Public Benefit Corporation and Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nOur conversion to a Delaware public benefit corporation may not result in the benefits that we anticipate, requires our directors to balance the interest of stockholders with other interests, and may subject us to legal uncertainty and other risks.\nOn February 1, 2021, after approval by our stockholders, we became a Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC). There are a very limited number of publicly traded PBCs, we are the first publicly traded company to convert to a PBC, and we are the largest publicly traded company, as measured by revenue or market capitalization, to operate as a PBC. As a PBC, we have unique legal obligations. We are required to adopt and include in our certificate of incorporation a public benefit purpose that is intended to have positive effects on a category of persons, entities or communities other than stockholder financial interest. Our public benefit purpose is to provide products and services that are intended to help make the industries we serve more productive, and to create high-quality employment opportunities in the communities in which we operate. Further, as a PBC, our Board is required to balance our stockholders' pecuniary (financial) interests, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct, and pursuit of our public benefit purpose. We have identified those materially affected by our conduct (which we refer to as stakeholders) as including our customers, our employees, our partners, and the communities in which we operate.\nWe believe that operating as a PBC is beneficial to our business and consistent with the long-term interests of stockholders, but the benefits we anticipate from operating as a PBC may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all, or there may be negative effects. Further, we may be unable or slow to achieve the public benefits we have identified or we may make balancing determinations that are ultimately harmful to our business or to stockholders, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nIn the event of a conflict between the interests of our stockholders, our stakeholders, and our public benefit purpose, our directors must only make an informed and disinterested decision, and not such that no person of ordinary, sound judgment would approve. Our directors have significant latitude under this standard and there is no guarantee that a conflict would be resolved in favor of our stockholders. This balancing obligation may allow our directors to make decisions that they could not have made pursuant to the fiduciary duties applicable prior to our PBC conversion, and such decisions may not maximize short-term stockholder value. For instance, in a sale of control transaction, our board of directors would be required to consider and balance the factors listed above and might choose to accept an offer that does not maximize short-term stockholder value due to its consideration of other factors.\nFurther, there is limited legal precedent or guidance regarding how to administer our obligation to balance the interests of stockholders, stakeholders, and the pursuit of our public benefit purpose. While we expect that, in large part, traditional Delaware corporation law principles and the application of those principles in case law-including those related to self-dealing, conflicts of interest, and the application of the business judgment rule-will continue to apply with respect to Delaware PBCs, there is currently limited case law involving PBCs, which may create legal uncertainty or additional litigation risk until additional case law develops. Stockholders of a Delaware PBC (if they, individually or collectively, own at least the lesser of two percent of the company's outstanding shares or shares with a market value of at least $2 million) may file suit to enforce the balancing obligation. Any such lawsuit might be a\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\ndistraction to our management and board of directors, and could be costly, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a PBC, we are required to disclose to stockholders a report at least biennially on that includes our assessment of our success in achieving our specific public benefit purpose, and we have committed to providing this report annually and making it publicly available. If we are not timely or are unable to provide this report, or if the report is not viewed favorably, our reputation and status as a public benefit corporation may be harmed.\nWhile we do not view the additional reporting obligations of a PBC to be onerous, Delaware's PBC statute may be amended in the future to require more explicit or burdensome periodic reporting requirements and that could increase our expenses. In addition, if the public perceives that we are not successful in our public benefit purpose, or that our pursuit of our public benefit purpose is having a negative effect on the financial interests of our stockholders, that perception could negatively affect our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur Class A common stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. In addition, the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our Class A common stock is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to those risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, other factors could impact the value of our common stock, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us, such as high-growth or cloud companies, or in valuation metrics, such as our price to revenues ratio;\n\u2022overall performance of the stock market;\n\u2022changes in our financial, operating or other metrics, regardless of whether we consider those metrics as reflective of the current state or long-term prospects of our business, and how those results compare to securities analyst expectations, including whether those results fail to meet, exceed, or significantly exceed securities analyst expectations;\n\u2022changes in the forward-looking estimates of our financial, operating, or other metrics, how those estimates compare to securities analyst expectations, or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that follow our Class A common stock;\n\u2022announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\n\u2022the net increase in the number of customers, either independently or as compared to published expectations of industry, financial, or other analysts that cover us;\n\u2022announcements by us or by our competitors of technological innovations, new solutions, enhancements to services, strategic alliances, or significant agreements;\n\u2022announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions or rumors of such transactions;\n\u2022the economy as a whole and market conditions within our industry and the industries of our customers;\n\u2022macroeconomic and geopolitical factors and instability and volatility in the global financial markets, including uncertainty surrounding the effects of COVID-19;\n\u2022the operating performance and market value of other comparable companies;\n\u2022securities or industry analysts downgrading our Class A common stock or publishing inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business;\n\u2022trading activity by directors, executive officers (in particular our Chief Executive Officer who holds a significant portion of our outstanding common stock), and other significant stockholders, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares; and\n\u2022any other factors discussed herein.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business,\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\noperating results, or financial condition. The market price of our Class A common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe dual-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain individuals and their affiliates, which will limit or preclude the ability of our investors to influence corporate matters and could depress the market value of our Class A common stock.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January 31, 2021, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Peter Gassner, holds approximately 45.7% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and holders of our Class B common stock hold approximately 52.2% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in the aggregate. Holders of our Class B common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and, assuming no material sales of such shares, will be able to control matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until October 15, 2023, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. This concentrated control will limit or preclude our investors\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters while the dual-class structure is in effect. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock or may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nS&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies with multiple classes of stock on certain indices, including the S&P 500. While this has not affected the inclusion of Veeva\u2019s Class A common stock in these indices to date, eligibility criteria of these indices and others may change in the future. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual-class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices and may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock. Any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms or other third-party ratings agencies critical of our corporate governance practices, capital structure, or other business practices could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock for the foreseeable future, so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangement. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of the price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our Class A common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things:\n\u2022provide for a dual-class common stock structure until October 15, 2023, which gives our Chief Executive Officer and certain of our holders and their respective affiliates the ability to control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\n\u2022permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors;\n\u2022provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of 66-2/3% of our stockholders;\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\n\u2022require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022require our board of directors to consider and balance our stockholders' pecuniary (financial) interests, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct, and the pursuit of our public benefit purpose, which may, in turn, allow our board of directors to make a decision about a change of control transaction that does not maximize short-term stockholder value;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for exclusive forums for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our bylaws also provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Securities Act, such a provision known as a \u201cFederal Forum Provision.\u201d Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our shares of capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 14231, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "VEEV"}
