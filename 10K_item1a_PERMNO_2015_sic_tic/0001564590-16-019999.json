RISK FACTORS\nWe operate globally in challenging and highly competitive markets and thus our business is subject to a variety of risks. Listed below are some of the more critical or unique risk factors that we have identified as affecting or potentially affecting our company and the offshore marine service industry which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statement. You should consider all risks when evaluating any of the company\u2019s forward-looking statements. The effect of any one risk factor or a combination of several risk factors could materially affect the company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and the accuracy of any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDepressed Prices for Oil and Gas and Resulting Changes in the Level of Capital Spending by Our Customers\nEven in a more favorable commodity pricing climate, prices for crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile and extremely sensitive to the respective supply/demand relationship for crude oil and natural gas. The significant decline in crude oil and natural gas prices that began in 2014 and continued throughout 2015 caused many of our customers to significantly reduce drilling, completion and other production activities and related spending on our products and services in 2015. Many exploration and production companies have already announced plans to further reduce spending and activity levels in 2016\u037e thus, we expect this trend to continue and potentially worsen in 2016 and potentially beyond. In addition, the reduction in demand from our customers has resulted in an oversupply of the vessels available for service, and such oversupply has substantially reduced the prices we can charge our customers for our services.\nMany factors affect the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas and, therefore, influence prices of these commodities, including:\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, including increased availability of non-traditional energy resources such as shale oil and gas\u037e\n\u00b7\nprices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas\u037e\n\u00b7\ndomestic and worldwide economic conditions, and the resulting global demand for oil and natural gas\u037e\n\u00b7\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas including the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels for oil, and decisions by OPEC to change production levels\u037e\n\u00b7\nsanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union, or other governments against oil producing countries;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas\u037e\n\u00b7\nthe level of excess production capacity, available pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity\u037e\n\u00b7\nlead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel\u037e\n\u00b7\nthe expected rates of decline in production from existing and prospective wells\u037e\n\u00b7\nthe discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves\u037e\n\u00b7\nfederal, state and local regulation of (i) exploration and drilling activities, (ii) equipment, material, supplies or services that we furnish and (iii) oil and gas exports\u037e\n\u00b7\npublic pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate hydraulic fracturing activities\u037e\n\u00b7\nweather conditions, including hurricanes, that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area and severe winter weather that can interfere with oil and gas development and production operations\u037e\n\u00b7\npolitical instability in oil and natural gas producing countries\u037e\n\u00b7\nadvances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption (such as fracking)\u037e\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuel and energy sources\u037e\n\u00b7\nuncertainty in capital and commodities markets\u037e and\n\u00b7\nchanges in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other major global currencies.\nThe ongoing depressed level of oil and natural gas prices significantly curtailed our customers\u2019 drilling, completion and other production activities and related spending on our services in fiscal 2016. The energy industry\u2019s level of capital spending is substantially related to current and expected future demand for hydrocarbons and the prevailing commodity prices of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. When commodity prices are low, or when our customers believe that they will be low in the future, our customers generally reduce their capital spending budgets for onshore and offshore drilling, exploration and field development. The continuing depressed levels of crude oil and natural gas prices has reduced significantly the energy industry\u2019s level of capital spending and as long as current conditions persist, capital spending and demand for our services may remain similarly depressed. It is difficult to predict how long the current commodity price conditions will continue, or to what extent low commodity prices will affect our business. Because a prolonged material downturn in crude oil and natural gas prices and/or perceptions of long-term lower commodity prices can negatively impact the development plans of exploration and production companies given the long-term nature of large-scale development projects, a downturn of any such duration would likely result in a significant decline in demand for offshore support services. Declining or continuing depressed oil and natural gas prices may result in negative pressures on:\n\u00b7\nour customer\u2019s capital spending and spending on our services;\n\u00b7\nour charter rates and/or utilization rates;\n\u00b7\nour results of operations, cash flows and financial condition;\n\u00b7\nthe fair market value of our vessels;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and make acquisitions, and the cost of that capital\u037e and\n\u00b7\nthe collectability of our receivables.\nMoreover, higher commodity prices will not necessarily translate into increased demand for offshore support services or sustained higher pricing for offshore support vessel services, in part because customer demand is based on future commodity price expectations and not solely on current prices. Additionally, increased commodity demand may in the future be satisfied by land-based energy resource production and any increased demand for offshore support vessel services can be more than offset by an increased supply of offshore support vessels resulting from the construction of additional offshore support vessels.\nCrude oil pricing volatility has increased in recent years as crude oil has emerged as a widely-traded financial asset class. To the extent speculative trading of crude oil causes excessive crude oil pricing volatility, our results of operations could potentially be negatively impacted if such price volatility affects spending and investment decisions of offshore exploration, development and production companies.\nReduced Lending in the Energy Sector; Amendments to Credit Facility\nLower oil and gas prices, which have led to a sustained slowdown in the level of commercial activity by energy and energy service companies, have put a significant number of credit facilities and other arrangements between borrowers and lenders under stress. The eventual resolution of these credit challenges and the impact of such resolutions for lenders or borrowers is currently unknown. However, there are a number of potential negative consequences for the energy and energy services sectors that may result if commodity prices remain depressed or continue to decline, including a general outflow of credit and capital from the energy and energy services sectors, further efforts by lenders to reduce their loan exposure to the energy sector, the imposition of increased lending standards for the energy and energy services sectors, higher borrowing costs and collateral requirements or a refusal to extend new credit or amend existing credit facilities in the energy and energy services sectors. These potential negative consequences may be exacerbated by the pressure exerted on financial institutions by bank regulatory agencies to respond quickly and decisively to credit risk that develops in distressed industries. All of these factors may complicate the ability of borrowers to achieve a favorable outcome in negotiating solutions to even marginally stressed credits.\nThe company may be required to provide collateral, pay higher interest rates and otherwise agree to more restrictive terms in order to secure amendments to its existing bank credit facility and other lending arrangements. Future debt financing arrangements, if available at all, may also require collateral, higher interest rates and more restrictive terms. Collateral requirements and higher borrowing costs may limit our long- and short-term financial flexibility, and any failure to obtain amendments to existing debt arrangements or to secure future financing on terms that are acceptable to the company could jeopardize our ability to (i) repay, refinance or reduce our debt obligations, (ii) fund, among other things, capital expenditures and general working capital needs, or (iii) meet our other financial commitments as they come due.\nWe may record additional losses or impairment charges related to our vessels.\nWe review the vessels in our active fleet for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable and we also perform a review of our stacked vessels not expected to return to active service every six months, or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a vessel may not be recoverable. We have recorded impairment charges of $117.3 million, $14.5 million and $9.3 million during the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. In the event that offshore E&P industry conditions continue to deteriorate, or persist at current levels, the company could be subject to additional vessel impairments in future periods. An impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over the estimated fair value. As part of this analysis, we make assumptions and estimates regarding future market conditions. To the extent actual results do not meet our estimated assumptions we may take an impairment loss in the future. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will not have to take additional impairment charges in the future if the currently depressed market conditions persist.\nThe amount of our debt and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nAs of March 31, 2016, we had $2,052.3 million of total debt. Our level of indebtedness, and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt, could have important consequences for our operations, including:\n\u00b7\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the agreements governing our indebtedness and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations\u037e\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities\u037e\n\u00b7\nrequiring that we pledge substantial collateral, including vessels which may limit flexibility in operating our business and restrict our ability to sell assets;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes and other activities\u037e\n\u00b7\nlimiting management's flexibility in operating our business\u037e\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate\u037e\n\u00b7\ndiminishing our ability to successfully withstand a further downturn in our business or further worsening of macroeconomic conditions\u037e\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors\u037e and making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, because certain of our debt has variable interest rates or because our current debt is at low fixed interest rates and in exchange for accommodations to our existing debt instruments, debt holders may demand higher interest rates; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to invest in the future in new vessels and to make other capital expenditures.\nOur long-term debt instruments are subject to affirmative and negative covenants, including financial ratios and tests, with which we must comply (including a requirement that we comply with a 3.0x minimum interest coverage covenant). These covenants include, among others, covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions without the permission of the holders of our indebtedness, including the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of investments and the sale of assets. Please see \u201cStatus of Discussions with Lenders and Noteholders / Audit Opinion\u201d disclosures in Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7 of this report for a discussion of the events of default which have been waived through August 14, 2016 and the resulting reclassification of our long-term debt.\nOur ability to satisfy required financial covenants, ratios and tests in our debt agreements can be limited by events beyond our control, including continuing low commodity prices, reduced demand for our services, depressed valuations of our assets as well as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance with such covenants or that the holders of our indebtedness will not seek to assert that we are not in compliance with our covenants. A breach of any of these covenants, ratios or tests could result in a default, which may result in a cross-default of other indebtedness. If we default, our lenders could declare all amounts of outstanding debt together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. The results of such actions would have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Absent available alternatives such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or capital structure, we would not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness. If such a result were to occur, we may be forced into bankruptcy or forced to seek bankruptcy protection to restructure our business and capital structure and may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a large extent, is subject to conditions in the oil and natural gas industry, including commodity prices, demand for our services and the prices we are able to charge for our services, general economic and financial conditions, competition in the markets in which we operate, the impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control.\nLower levels of offshore exploration and development activity and spending by our customers globally has had a direct and significant impact on our financial performance, financial condition and financial outlook. As a result, we continue to explore alternatives to improve our financial position and liquidity, including pursuing amendments to existing debt arrangements, a debt restructuring and possible strategic transactions. We may not be able to implement any of these such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and, even if we are successful in implementing amendments to existing debt arrangements, a debt restructuring or strategic transaction, such actions may not be successful in allowing us to meet our debt obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt or other obligations, or to implement amendments to existing debt arrangements, a debt restructuring or strategic transaction, our creditors could potentially force us into bankruptcy or we could be forced to seek bankruptcy protection to restructure our business and capital structure, in which case we could be forced to liquidate our assets at potentially depressed valuations and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements. Even if we are able to implement amendments to existing debt arrangements, a debt restructuring or strategic transaction, such amendments, debt restructuring or strategic transaction may impose onerous terms on us. As a result, any amendments to existing debt arrangements, debt restructuring, strategic transaction or bankruptcy proceeding could place equity holders at significant risk of losing some or all of their interests in our company.\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry. We may not be able to finance future growth of our operations or future acquisitions.\nOur activities require substantial capital expenditures. If our cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund capital expenditures, we would be required to further reduce these expenditures or to fund capital expenditures through debt or equity issuance or through alternative financing plans or selling assets.\nOur ability to raise debt or equity capital or to refinance or restructure existing debt arrangements will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other things. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants and may require us to provide substantial collateral to some or all of our debt holders, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. We currently have limited ability to raise new capital or refinance our indebtedness and, as a result, we have undertaken efforts to curtail our spending, which\nmay limit our ability to grow our business and our ability to sustain or improve our profits may be adversely affected. Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAny limitations in our ability to finance future capital expenditures may limit our ability to respond to changes in customer preferences, technological change and other market conditions, which may diminish our competitive position within our sector.\nConsolidation of the Company\u2019s Customer Base\nOil and natural gas companies and other energy companies and energy services companies have undergone consolidation, and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation reduces the number of customers for the company\u2019s equipment, and may negatively affect exploration, development and production activity as consolidated companies focus, at least initially, on increasing efficiency and reducing costs and delay or abandon exploration activity with less promise. Such activity could adversely affect demand for the company\u2019s offshore services.\nHigh Level of Competition in the Offshore Marine Service Industry\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which could depress charter and utilization rates and adversely affect our financial performance. We compete for business with our competitors on the basis of price; reputation for quality service; quality, suitability and technical capabilities of our vessels and ROVs; availability of vessels and ROVs; safety and efficiency; cost of mobilizing vessels and ROVs from one market to a different market; and national flag preference. In addition, competition in international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring, among other things, local construction, flagging, ownership or control of vessels, the awarding of contracts to local contractors, the employment of local citizens and/or the purchase of supplies from local vendors.\nLoss of a Major Customer\nWe derive a significant amount of revenue from a relatively small number of customers. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the five largest customers accounted for approximately 47%, 45%, and 45%, respectively, of the company\u2019s total revenues, while the 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 69%, 62%, and 62%, respectively, of our total revenues. While it is normal for our customer base to change over time as our time charter contracts expire and are replaced, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if one or more of these customers were to decide to interrupt or curtail their activities, in general, or their activities with us; terminate their contracts with us; fail to renew existing contracts; and/or refuse to award new contracts.\nUnconventional Crude Oil and Unconventional Natural Gas Production Can Exert Downward Pricing Pressures on the Price of Crude Oil and Natural Gas\nThe rise in production of unconventional crude oil and gas resources in North America and the commissioning of a number of new large Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) export facilities around the world have contributed to an over-supplied natural gas market. Production from unconventional resources has increased as drilling efficiencies have improved, lowering the costs of extraction. There has been a buildup of crude oil and natural gas inventories in the United States in part due to the increased development of unconventional crude oil and natural gas resources. Prolonged increases in the worldwide supply of crude oil and natural gas, whether from conventional or unconventional sources, without a commensurate growth in demand for crude oil and natural gas will likely continue to weigh on crude oil and natural gas prices. A prolonged period of low crude oil and natural gas prices would likely have a negative impact on development plans of exploration and production companies), which in turn, may result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services.\nChallenging Macroeconomic Conditions\nUncertainty about future global economic market conditions makes it challenging to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. The success of our business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial and credit markets that are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Uncertain economic conditions may lead our customers to postpone capital spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in our customers\u2019 income or asset values. Similarly, when lenders and institutional investors reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide funding to corporate and other industrial borrowers, the liquidity and financial condition of our company\nand our customers can be adversely impacted. These factors may also adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. Factors such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls, and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts, security operations, and seaborne refugee issues) can have a material negative effect on our business, revenues and profitability.\nPotential Overcapacity in the Offshore Marine Industry\nOver the past decade, the combination of historically high commodity prices and technological advances resulted in significant growth in deepwater exploration, field development and production. As a result, offshore service companies, such as ours, constructed specialized offshore vessels that are capable of supporting deepwater and deep well (defined by well depth rather than water depth) projects. During this time, construction of offshore vessels increased significantly in order to meet projected requirements of customers and potential customers. Excess offshore support vessel capacity usually exerts downward pressure on charter day rates. Excess capacity can occur when newly constructed vessels enter the worldwide offshore support vessel market and also when vessels migrate between markets. A discussion about the company\u2019s vessel fleet and vessel construction programs appears in the \u201cVessel Count, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Construction Programs\u201d section of Item 7 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe offshore support vessel market has approximately 435 new-build offshore support vessels (deepwater PSVs, deepwater AHTS vessels and towing-supply vessels only) either under construction (355 vessels), on order or planned as of March 2016, which are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore support vessel market primarily over the next 18-24 months, according to IHS-Petrodata. The current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately 3,440 vessels, according to the same source. An increase in vessel capacity without a corresponding increase in the working offshore rig count could exacerbate the industry\u2019s currently oversupplied condition which may have the effect of lowering charter rates and utilization rates, which, in turn, would result in lower revenues to the company.\nIn addition, the provisions of U.S. shipping laws restricting engagement of U.S. coastwise trade to vessels controlled by U.S. citizens may from time to time be circumvented by foreign competitors that seek to engage in trade reserved for vessels controlled by U.S. citizens and otherwise qualifying for coastwise trade. A repeal, suspension or significant modification of U.S. shipping laws, or the administrative erosion of their benefits, permitting vessels that are either foreign-flagged, foreign-built, foreign-owned, foreign-controlled or foreign-operated to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade, could also result in excess vessel capacity and increased competition, especially for our vessels that operate in North America.\nVessel Construction and Maintenance\nThe company has six remaining vessels currently under construction and routinely engages shipyards to drydock vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance services. Construction projects and drydockings are subject to risks of delays and cost overruns, resulting from shortages and/or delivery delays in regards to equipment, materials and skilled labor, including third-party service technicians. In addition, the cost, timing and duration of drydockings and repairs and maintenance can be negatively impacted by lack of shipyard availability, unforeseen design and engineering problems, work stoppages, weather, financial, labor and other difficulties at shipyards, including the inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals.\nA significant delay in either construction or drydockings of vessels could negatively impact our ability to fulfill contractual commitments. Significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction could also adversely affect the company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThere is a risk of insolvency of the shipyards that construct, repair or drydock our vessels, which could adversely affect our new construction or repair programs, and consequently, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOperating Internationally\nWe operate in various regions throughout the world and are exposed to many risks inherent in doing business in countries other than the United States, some of which have recently become more pronounced. Our customary risks of operating internationally include political and economic instability within the host country; possible vessel seizures or nationalization of assets and other governmental actions by the host country, including enforcement of customs, immigration or other laws that are not well developed or consistently enforced; foreign government regulations that favor or require the\nawarding of contracts to local competitors; an inability to recruit, retain or obtain work visas for workers of international operations; difficulties or delays in collecting customer and other accounts receivable; changing taxation policies; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; foreign currency revaluations and devaluations; restrictions on converting foreign currencies into U.S. dollars; expatriating customer and other payments made in jurisdictions outside of the United States; and import/export quotas and restrictions or other trade barriers, most of which are beyond the control of the company. See (i) Item 7 and Note (12) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our Venezuelan operations regarding vessel seizures and (ii) Item 1 and Note (12) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our Sonatide joint venture in Angola. While we no longer operate in Venezuela, we note that the company has substantial operations in Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Angola and throughout the west coast of Africa, which generate a large portion of our revenue, where we are exposed to the risks described above.\nThe company is also subject to acts of piracy and kidnappings that put its assets and personnel at risk. The increase in the level of these criminal or terrorist acts over the last several years has been well-publicized. As a marine services company that operates in offshore, coastal or tidal waters in challenging areas, the company is particularly vulnerable to these kinds of unlawful activities. Although the company takes what it considers to be prudent measures to protect its personnel and assets in markets that present these risks, it has confronted these kinds of incidents in the past, and there can be no assurance it will not be subjected to them in the future.\nThe continued threat of terrorist activity, other acts of war or hostility and civil unrest have significantly increased the risk of political, economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates. It is possible that further acts of terrorism or civil unrest may be directed against the United States domestically or abroad, and such acts of terrorism or civil unrest could be directed against properties and personnel of U.S. headquartered companies such as ours. To date, the company has not experienced any material adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition as a result of terrorism, political instability, civil unrest or war.\nRisks Inherent in Acquiring Businesses\nAlthough acquisitions have historically been an element of our business strategy, we cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. We may be required to incur substantial indebtedness or issue equity to finance future acquisitions. Such additional debt service requirements may impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and any equity issuance could have a dilutive impact on our stockholders. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully consolidate the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business. Acquisitions may not perform as expected when the transaction was consummated and may be dilutive to our overall operating results. In addition, our management may not be able to effectively manage a substantially larger business or successfully operate a new line of business.\nEntry into New Lines of Business\nHistorically, the company\u2019s operations and acquisitions focused primarily on offshore marine vessel services for the oil and gas industry. We have recently expanded our capability to provide subsea services through the acquisition of employees with specialized subsea skills and ROVs. The company may expand its subsea capabilities further and enter into additional lines of business. Entry into, or further development of, lines of business in which the company has not historically operated may expose us to business and operational risks that are different from those we have experienced historically. Our management may not be able to effectively manage these additional risks or implement successful business strategies in new lines of business. Additionally, our competitors in these lines of business may possess substantially greater operational knowledge, resources and experience than the company.\nDoing Business through Joint Venture Operations\nThe company operates in several foreign areas through joint ventures with local companies, in some cases as a result of local laws requiring local company ownership. While the joint venture partner may provide local knowledge and experience, entering into joint ventures often requires us to surrender a measure of control over the assets and operations devoted to the joint venture, and occasions may arise when we do not agree with the business goals and objectives of our partner, or other factors may arise that make the continuation of the relationship unwise or untenable. Any such disagreements or discontinuation of the relationship could disrupt our operations, put assets dedicated to the joint venture at risk, or affect the continuity of our business. If we are unable to resolve issues with a joint venture partner, we may decide to terminate the joint venture and either locate a different partner and continue to work in the area or seek opportunities for our assets in another market. The unwinding of an existing joint venture could prove to be difficult or\ntime-consuming, and the loss of revenue related to the termination or unwinding of a joint venture and costs related to the sourcing of a new partner or the mobilization of assets to another market could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Please refer to Item 1 and Item 3 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of our Sonatide joint venture in Angola and our joint venture in Nigeria, respectively.\nInternational Operations Exposed to Currency Devaluation and Fluctuation Risk\nAs a global company, our international operations are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks on all charter hire contracts denominated in foreign currencies. For some of our international contracts, a portion of the revenue and local expenses is incurred in local currencies and the company is at risk of changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. In some instances, we receive payments in currencies which are not easily traded and may be illiquid. We generally do not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business, which exposes us to the risk of exchange rate losses. Gains and losses from the revaluation of our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in our consolidated statements of operations. Foreign currency fluctuations may cause the U.S. dollar value of our non-U.S. results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations. This could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.\nTo minimize the financial impact of these items, we attempt to contract a significant majority of our services in U.S. dollars and, when feasible, the company attempts to not maintain large, non-U.S. dollar-denominated cash balances. In addition, the company attempts to minimize the financial impact of these risks by matching the currency of the company\u2019s operating costs with the currency of revenue streams when considered appropriate. We monitor the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in U.S. dollars.\nAs of March 31, 2016, Sonatide maintained the equivalent of approximately $119 million of Angola kwanza-denominated deposits in Angolan banks, largely related to customer receipts that had not yet been converted to U.S. dollars, expatriated and then remitted to the company. During fiscal 2016, the entities which comprise the operations of the Sonatide joint venture recognized a foreign exchange loss of approximately $49.2 million, primarily as a result of the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza relative to the U.S. dollar and the resulting revaluation of Sonatide\u2019s Angolan kwanza-denominated bank balances. The company has recognized 49% of the total foreign exchange loss, or approximately $24.1 million, from the Sonatide entities through equity in net earnings/(losses) of unconsolidated companies. Any further devaluation in the Angolan kwanza relative to the U.S. dollar would result in foreign exchange losses for Sonatide to the extent the Angolan kwanza-denominated asset balances were in excess of kwanza-denominated liabilities, 49% of which will be borne by the company. Sonatide may be able to mitigate this exposure, but a hypothetical ten percent devaluation of the kwanza relative to the U.S. dollar on a net kwanza-denominated asset balance of $100 million would cause our equity in net earnings of unconsolidated companies to be reduced by $4.9 million.\nOperational Hazards\nThe company\u2019s operations are subject to the hazards inherent in the offshore oilfield business. These include blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, capsizings, sinkings, groundings and severe weather conditions. Some of these events could be the result of (or exacerbated by) mechanical failure or navigation or operational errors. These hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment (including to the property and equipment of third parties), pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations, increased costs and loss of business. Damages arising from such occurrences may result in lawsuits alleging large claims, and the company may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards.\nOur exposure to operating hazards may increase significantly with the expansion of our subsea operations, including through the ownership and operation of ROVs and the provision of engineering design and consulting services for customers\u2019 subsea initiatives. For example, the company may lose equipment, including ROVs, in the course of our subsea operations. This equipment may be difficult or costly to replace, and such losses may result in work stoppages or the loss of customers. Additionally, many of our subsea operations will be performed on or near existing oil and gas infrastructure. These operations may expose us to new or increased liability relating to explosions, blowouts and cratering; mechanical problems, including pipe failure; and environmental accidents, including oil spills, gas leaks or ruptures,\nuncontrollable flows of oil, gas, brine or well fluids, or other discharges of toxic gases or other pollutants. Finally, provision of engineering design and consulting services could expose us to professional liability for errors and omissions made in the course of those services.\nWe carry what we consider to be prudent levels of liability insurance, and our vessels and ROVs are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss, including war, terrorism acts and pollution risks. While we maintain insurance protection and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold the company harmless from some of these risks, the company\u2019s insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. Our insurance coverages are subject to deductibles and certain exclusions. The company does not directly or fully insure for business interruption. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to the company could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, while we believe that we should be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates considered commercially acceptable, we cannot guarantee that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially acceptable rates given the markets in which the company operates.\nCompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Similar Worldwide Anti-Bribery Laws\nOur global operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and anti-corruption. As a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit. We have adopted proactive procedures to promote compliance with the FCPA, but we may be held liable for actions taken by local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may themselves not be subject to the FCPA. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA (or any other applicable anti-bribery laws in countries in which the company does business) could have a material adverse effect on our business and business reputation, as well as our results of operations, and cash flows.\nCompliance with Complex and Developing Laws and Regulations\nOur operations are subject to many complex and burdensome laws and regulations. Stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and the manning, construction and operation of vessels significantly affect our operations. Many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the United States Coast Guard, the United States Customs and Border Protection, and their foreign equivalents; as well as to standards imposed by private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping, the Oil Companies International Marine Forum, and the International Marine Contractors Association.\nFurther, many of the countries in which we operate have laws, regulations and enforcement systems that are less well developed than the laws, regulations and enforcement systems of the United States, and the requirements of these systems are not always readily discernible even to experienced and proactive participants. These countries\u2019 laws can be unclear, and, the application and enforcement of these laws and regulations can be unpredictable and subject to frequent change or reinterpretation. Sometimes governments may apply such changes or reinterpretations with retroactive effect, and may impose associated taxes, fees, fines or penalties on the company based on that reinterpretation or retroactive effect. While the company endeavors to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our compliance efforts might not always be wholly successful, and failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, imposition of remedial obligations or the suspension or termination of the company\u2019s operations. These laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others, including charterers or third party agents. Moreover, these laws and regulations could be changed or be interpreted in new, unexpected ways that substantially increase costs that the company may not be able to pass along to its customers. Any changes in laws, regulations or standards imposing additional requirements or restrictions could adversely affect the company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nChanges in Laws Governing U.S. Taxation of Foreign Source Income\nWe operate globally through various subsidiaries which are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, including laws or policies directed toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates. We determine our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in each jurisdiction for the period during which we operate and earn income. A material change in the tax laws, tax treaties, regulations or accounting principles, or interpretation thereof, in one or more countries in which we conduct business, or in which we are incorporated or a resident of, could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings, and such change could be significant to our financial results. In addition, our overall effective tax rate could be adversely and suddenly affected by lower than anticipated earnings in countries with lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries with higher statutory rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nApproximately 88% of the company\u2019s revenues and a majority of the company\u2019s net income are generated by its operations outside of the United States. The company\u2019s effective tax rate has averaged approximately 22% since fiscal 2006, primarily a result of the passage of The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which excluded from the company\u2019s current taxable income in the U.S. income earned offshore through our controlled foreign subsidiaries.\nPeriodically, tax legislative initiatives are proposed to effectively increase U.S. taxation of income with respect to foreign operations. Whether any such initiatives will win congressional or executive approval and become law is presently unknown; however, if any such initiatives were to become law, and were such law to apply to the company\u2019s international operations, it could result in a materially higher tax expense, which would have a material impact on the company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and which could cause the company to review the utility of continued U.S. domicile.\nIn addition, our income tax returns are subject to review and examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities where tax returns are filed. The company routinely evaluates the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. We do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure or intercompany transfer pricing policies, or if the terms of certain income tax treaties were to be interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure, or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompliance with Environmental Regulations\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that control the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection. Compliance with such laws and regulations may require installation of costly equipment, increased manning or operational changes. Some environmental laws impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject the company to liability without regard to whether the company was negligent or at fault.\nA variety of regulatory developments, proposals and requirements have been introduced (and in some cases enacted) in the U.S. and various other countries that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases. Notwithstanding the current downturn in the oil industry punctuated by lessened demand and lower oil prices, any such regulations could ultimately result in the increased cost of energy as well as environmental and other costs, and capital expenditures could be necessary to comply with the limitations. These developments may have adverse effect on future production and demand for hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for the company\u2019s offshore support vessels, ROVs and other assets, which are highly dependent on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production markets. In addition, the increased regulation of environmental emissions may create greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources. Unless and until regulations are implemented and their effects are known, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate their impact on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to compete. However, any long term material adverse effect on the crude oil and natural gas industry may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate Change and Greenhouse Gas Restrictions\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. These requirements could make our customer\u2019s products more expensive and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas, any of which may reduce demand for our services.\nUnionization Efforts and Collective Bargaining Negotiations\nIn locations in which the company is required to do so, the company has union workers, subject to collective bargaining agreements, that are periodically in negotiation. These negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses, other increased costs, or increased operational restrictions. Further, efforts have been made from time to time to unionize other portions of our workforce, including our U.S. GOM employees. We have also been subjected to threatened strikes or work stoppages and other labor disruptions in certain countries. Additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our costs and operating restrictions, reduce our revenues, or limit our flexibility.", "PERMNO": 50606, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "TDW"}
