RISK FACTORS\nSummary of Risks\nOur businesses are subject to a number of inherent risks. We believe that the primary risks affecting our businesses and an investment in our units are:\n\u2022\na complex regulatory and tax environment involving rules and regulations (both domestic and foreign), some of which are outdated relative to today\u2019s complex financial activities and some of which are subject to political influence, which could restrict or require us to adjust our operations or the operations of our funds or portfolio companies and subject us to increased compliance costs and administrative burdens, as well as restrictions on our business activities;\n\u2022\npoor performance by our funds, including due to market conditions, political actions or environments, monetary and fiscal policy or other conditions beyond our control;\n\u2022\nthe reputational harm that we would experience as a result of inappropriately addressing conflicts of interest, poor performance by the investments we manage or the actual or alleged failure by us, our employees, our funds or our portfolio companies to comply with applicable regulations in an increasingly complex political and regulatory environment;\n\u2022\npotential variability in our period to period earnings due primarily to mark-to-market valuations of our funds\u2019 investments. As a result of this variability, the market price of our common units may be volatile and subject to fluctuations; the increasing demands of the investing community, including the potential for fee compression and changes to other terms, which could materially adversely affect our revenues; and\n\u2022\nan investment in our units is not an investment in our underlying funds. Moreover, there can be no assurance that projections respecting performance of our underlying funds or unrealized values will be achieved.\nRisks Related to Our Businesses\nDifficult market and political conditions may adversely affect our businesses in many ways, including by reducing the value or hampering the performance of the investments made by our funds or reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.\nOur businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political conditions throughout the world, such as interest rates, the availability and cost of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to our taxation, taxation of our investors, the possibility of changes to tax laws in either the United States or any non-U.S. jurisdiction and regulations on alternative asset managers), trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts and security operations). These factors are outside of our control and may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and value of investments, and we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions.\nGlobal financial markets have experienced heightened volatility in recent periods, including during August and September 2015, then again in January 2016, following the decision of the People\u2019s Bank of China to reduce the foreign exchange value of the renminbi, and again in June 2016 following the referendum in the UK in favor of exiting the EU. The transition of leadership following the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional election and related uncertainty regarding potential shifts in U.S. foreign, trade, economic and other policies under the new administration have heightened volatility in the U.S. and global markets, which could persist for an extended period. Concerns over significant declines in the commodities markets, concerns over increasing interest rates, particularly short-term rates, increases in the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar, sluggish economic expansion in non-U.S. economies, including continued concerns over growth prospects in China and emerging markets, growing debt loads for certain countries and uncertainty about the consequences of the U.S. and other governments withdrawing monetary stimulus measures all highlight the fact that economic conditions remain unpredictable and volatile.\nThe ongoing weakness in commodity prices, especially of crude oil, and the uncertainty regarding the stability of the oil and gas markets have resulted in a tightening of the credit market across multiple sectors. Following mark-to-market losses on commodity-related debt, overall credit returns remained in negative territory in 2016 and increased financing costs for businesses in unrelated sectors. In addition, following a sustained period of historically low interest rate levels, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate in December 2015 and again in December 2016. These developments, along with the U.S. government\u2019s credit and deficit concerns, the European sovereign debt crisis and the economic slowdown in China, caused borrowing costs to rise and generally constrained access to leverage.\nFurther, the potential impact of the results of the presidential election and resulting uncertainties regarding possible policies that could be implemented has led to further disruption, instability and volatility in the global markets. There can be no assurance these market conditions will not continue or worsen in the future.\nThese and other conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy have resulted in, and may continue to result in, adverse consequences for us and many of our funds, each of which could adversely affect the business of such funds, restrict such funds\u2019 investment activities, impede such funds\u2019 ability to effectively achieve their investment objectives and result in lower returns than we anticipated at the time certain of our investments were made. More specifically, these economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results by causing:\n\u2022\ndecreases in the market value of securities and debt instruments held by some of our funds;\n\u2022\nilliquidity in the market, which could adversely affect transaction volumes and the pace of realization of our funds\u2019 investments or otherwise restrict the ability of our funds to realize value from their investments, thereby adversely affecting our ability to generate incentive or other income;\n\u2022\nour assets under management to decrease, thereby lowering management fees payable by our funds; and\n\u2022\nincreases in costs or reduced availability of financial instruments that finance our funds.\nDuring periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns (which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies), companies in which we invest may experience decreased revenues, financial losses, credit rating downgrades, difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs. During such periods, these companies may also have difficulty in expanding their businesses and operations and be unable to meet their debt service obligations or other expenses as they become due, including expenses payable to us. Negative financial results in our funds\u2019 portfolio companies may reduce the value of our portfolio companies, the net asset value of our funds and the investment returns for our funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. In addition, such conditions would increase the risk of default with respect to credit-oriented or debt investments. Our funds may be adversely affected by reduced opportunities to exit and realize value from their investments, by lower than expected returns on investments made prior to the deterioration of the credit markets and by our inability to find suitable investments for the funds to effectively deploy capital, which could adversely affect our ability to raise new funds and thus adversely impact our prospects for future growth.\nPolitical and regulatory conditions, including the effects of negative publicity surrounding the financial industry in general and proposed legislation, could adversely affect our businesses or cause a material increase in our tax liability.\nAs a result of market disruptions and highly publicized financial scandals in recent years, regulators and investors have exhibited concerns over the integrity of the U.S. financial markets, and the businesses in which we operate both in the United States and outside the United States will be subject to new or additional regulations. We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, the CFTC or other U.S. governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. See \u201c-Regulatory changes and other developments in the United States and regulatory compliance failures could adversely affect our reputation, businesses and operations.\u201d\nOn several occasions in recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislative proposals that, if enacted, would repeal the exception from taxation as a corporation currently available to certain publicly traded partnerships and/or would raise the tax rate on carried interest and treat carried interest as ordinary income as well as change the tax treatment of investment managers and investment structures. A number of similar legislative proposals have been introduced in state legislatures. If these proposals or any similar legislation or regulation were to be enacted and apply to us, we would incur a material increase in our tax liability, our cash available for distribution would be reduced, which could reduce the value of our units, our effective tax rate could increase significantly or the amount of taxes that we, our professionals and other key personnel would be required to pay could materially increase. See \u201c-Risks Related to Taxation.\u201d\nMost recently, members of Congress and the Trump administration have raised reform proposals that would dramatically change the U.S. federal tax system. These proposals would meaningfully reduce individual and corporate tax rates and under one or more of those proposals, would convert the federal income tax system into a \u201cdestination-based cash flow\u201d tax system, under which, net interest expense would not be deductible, investment in tangible property and intangible assets (other than land) would be immediately deductible, export revenue would not be taxable, and the cost of imports would not be deductible. We cannot predict whether and to what extent these proposals, or any other legislative or administrative changes, if and when enacted, could affect the value of any investments made by us (including by adversely affecting the portfolio companies of the funds we manage), and the tax consequences to us and our unitholders; however, such consequences would likely be significant.\nCongress, Her Majesty's Treasury (\"HM Treasury\"), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the \u201cOECD\u201d) and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates invest or do business have maintained a focus on issues related to the taxation of businesses, including multinational entities. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued guidance through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project that contemplates changes to long standing international tax norms that determine each country\u2019s jurisdiction to tax cross-border trade and profits. On June 29, 2016, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) issued final regulations that would require the parent entity of certain U.S. multinational enterprise groups to file an annual report that would provide information on a country-by-country basis related to the group\u2019s income and taxes paid. These changes in law or guidance and additional proposals for reform, if enacted by the United States or by other countries in which we or our affiliates invest or do business, or, even if not enacted, could adversely affect our investment returns, including by increasing our tax compliance costs. Whether these or other proposals will be enacted by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction and in what form is unknown, as are the ultimate consequences of any such proposed legislation. See \u201c-Risks Related to Taxation.\u201d\nOur business depends in large part on our ability to raise capital from investors. If we were unable to raise such capital, we would be unable to collect management fees or deploy such capital into investments, which would materially reduce our revenues and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur ability to raise capital from investors depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside our control. Investors may downsize their investment allocations to alternative asset managers, including private funds and hedge funds, to rebalance a disproportionate weighting of their overall investment portfolio among asset classes. Poor performance of our funds, or regulatory or tax constraints, could also make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Our investors and potential investors continually assess our funds\u2019 performance independently and relative to market benchmarks and our competitors, which affects our ability to raise capital for existing and future funds. If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may be unable to raise sufficient amounts of capital to support the investment activities of future funds. If we were unable to successfully raise capital, our revenue and cash flow would be reduced, and our financial condition would be adversely affected. Furthermore, while our senior professional owners have committed substantial capital to our funds, commitments from new investors may depend on the commitments made by our senior professional owners to new funds and there can be no assurance that there will be further commitments to our funds, and any future investments by them in our funds or other alternative investment categories will likely depend on the performance of our funds, the performance of their overall investment portfolios and other investment opportunities available to them.\nWe depend on the Holdco Members, senior professionals and other key personnel, and our ability to retain them and attract additional qualified personnel is critical to our success and our growth prospects.\nWe depend on the diligence, skill, judgment, business contacts and personal reputations of the Holdco Members, senior professionals and other key personnel. Our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our senior professionals and other key personnel and our ability to recruit additional qualified personnel. These individuals possess substantial experience and expertise in investing, are responsible for locating and executing our funds\u2019 investments, have significant relationships with the institutions that are the source of many of our funds\u2019 investment opportunities and, in certain cases, have strong relationships with our investors. Therefore, if any of our senior professionals or other key personnel join competitors or form competing companies, it could result in the loss of significant investment opportunities, limit our ability to raise capital from certain existing investors or result in the loss of certain existing investors.\nThe departure or bad acts for any reason of any of our senior professionals, or a significant number of our other investment professionals, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objectives, cause certain of our investors to withdraw capital they invest with us or elect not to commit additional capital to our funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and our prospects. The departure of some or all of those individuals could also trigger certain \u201ckey person\u201d provisions in the documentation governing certain of our funds, which would permit the investors in those funds to suspend or terminate such funds\u2019 investment periods or, in the case of certain funds, permit investors to withdraw their capital prior to expiration of the applicable lock-up date. We do not carry any \u201ckey person\u201d insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our senior professionals, and we do not have a policy that prohibits our senior professionals from traveling together. See \u201c-Employee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\u201d\nWe anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add investment professionals both to grow our businesses and to replace those who depart. However, the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive, both in the United States and internationally, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or we may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. Our efforts to retain and attract investment professionals may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability or result in an increase in the portion of our performance fees that we grant to our investment professionals. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred equity compensation expenses of $39.1 million and we expect these costs to continue to increase in the future as we increase the use of equity compensation awards to attract, retain and compensate employees.\nOur failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses.\nAs we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our businesses, we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our funds\u2019 investment activities. Certain of our funds may have overlapping investment objectives, including funds that have different fee structures, and potential conflicts may arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those funds. For example, a decision to receive material non-public information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund may give rise to a potential conflict of interest when it results in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to trade in the securities of such company. We may also cause different Private Equity funds to invest in a single portfolio company, for example where the fund that made an initial investment\nno longer has capital available to invest. We may also cause different funds that we advise to purchase different classes of securities in the same portfolio company. For example, in the normal course of business our Credit Group funds acquire debt positions in companies in which our Private Equity funds own common equity securities. A direct conflict of interest could arise between the debt holders and the equity holders if such a company were to develop insolvency concerns. In addition, our Credit Group funds could be restricted from selling their positions in such companies for extended periods because investment professionals in the Private Equity Group sit on the boards of such companies. Certain funds in different groups may invest alongside each other in the same security. The different investment objectives or fund terms of such funds may result in a potential conflict of interest. In addition, conflicts of interest may exist in the valuation of our investments and regarding decisions about the allocation of specific investment opportunities among us and our funds and the allocation of fees and costs among us, our funds and their portfolio companies. Though we believe we have appropriate means and oversight to resolve these conflicts, our judgment on any particular allocation could be challenged. While we have developed general guidelines regarding when two or more funds can invest in different parts of the same company\u2019s capital structure and created a process that we employ to handle such conflicts if they arise, our decision to permit the investments to occur in the first instance or our judgment on how to minimize the conflict could be challenged. If we fail to appropriately address any such conflicts, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us or result in potential litigation against us.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, business relationships, quality of service provided to investors, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, fund terms (including fees), brand recognition and business reputation. We compete with a number of private equity funds, specialized funds, hedge funds, corporate buyers, traditional asset managers, real estate development companies, commercial banks, investment banks, other investment managers and other financial institutions, as well as sovereign wealth funds. Numerous factors increase our competitive risks, including:\n\u2022\na number of our competitors in some of our businesses have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do;\n\u2022\nsome of our funds may not perform as well as competitors\u2019 funds or other available investment products;\n\u2022\nseveral of our competitors have raised significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to our funds, particularly our funds that directly use leverage or rely on debt financing of their portfolio investments to generate superior investment returns;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds than us, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments that we want to make;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may be subject to less regulation and, accordingly, may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than we do and/or bear less compliance expense than we do;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have more flexibility than us in raising certain types of funds under the investment management contracts they have negotiated with their investors;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by investors as having better expertise in a specific asset class or geographic region than we do;\n\u2022\nour competitors that are corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment; and\n\u2022\nother industry participants may, from time to time, seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us.\nWe may lose investment opportunities in the future if we do not match investment valuations, structures and terms offered by our competitors. Alternatively, we may experience decreased profitability, rates of return and increased risks of loss if we match investment valuations, structures and terms offered by our competitors. Moreover, if we are forced to compete with other investment managers on the basis of price when fundraising, we may not be able to maintain our current fund fee and carried interest terms. We have historically competed primarily on the performance of our funds and not on the level of our fees or carried interest relative to those of our competitors. However, there is a risk that fees and carried interest in the investment management industry will decline, without regard to the historical performance of a manager. Fee or carried interest reductions on existing or future funds, without corresponding decreases in our cost structure, would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, the attractiveness of investments in our funds relative to other investment products could decrease depending\non economic conditions. This competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future funds, either of which would adversely impact our businesses, revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nLastly, institutional and individual investors are allocating increasing amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies. Several large institutional investors have announced a desire to consolidate their investments in a more limited number of managers. We expect that this will cause competition in our industry to intensify and could lead to a reduction in the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that many of our funds seek to exploit.\nPoor performance of our funds would cause a decline in our revenue and results of operations, may obligate us to repay performance fees previously paid to us and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future funds.\nWe derive revenues primarily from:\n\u2022\nmanagement fees, which are based generally on the amount of capital committed to or invested by our funds;\n\u2022\nperformance fees, which are based on the performance of our funds; and\n\u2022\nreturns on investments of our own capital in the funds we sponsor and manage.\nWhen any of our funds perform poorly, either by incurring losses or underperforming benchmarks, as compared to our competitors or otherwise, our investment record suffers. As a result, our performance fees may be adversely affected and, all else being equal, the value of our assets under management could decrease, which may, in turn, reduce our management fees. Moreover, we may experience losses on investments of our own capital in our funds as a result of poor investment performance. If a fund performs poorly, we will receive little or no performance fees with regard to the fund and little income or possibly losses from our own principal investment in such fund. Furthermore, if, as a result of poor performance or otherwise, a fund does not achieve total investment returns that exceed a specified investment return threshold over the life of the fund or other measurement period, we may be obligated to repay the amount by which performance fees that were previously distributed or paid to us exceeds amounts to which we were entitled. Poor performance of our funds could also make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Investors in our closed-end funds may decline to invest in future closed-end funds we raise as a result of poor performance. Poor performance of our publicly traded funds may result in stockholders selling their stock, thereby causing a decline in the stock price and limiting our ability to access capital. A failure to grow the assets of such funds will limit our ability to earn additional management fees and performance fees, and will ultimately affect our operating results. Our fund investors and potential fund investors continually assess our funds\u2019 performance independently and relative to market benchmarks and our competitors, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future funds and avoid excessive redemption levels depends on our funds\u2019 performance. Accordingly, poor fund performance may deter future investment in our funds and thereby decrease the capital invested in our funds and, ultimately, our management fee income. Alternatively, in the face of poor fund performance, investors could demand lower fees or fee concessions for existing or future funds which would likewise decrease our revenue.\nARCC\u2019s management fee comprises a significant portion of our management fees and a reduction in fees from ARCC could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nThe management fees we receive from ARCC (including fees attributable to ARCC Part I Fees) comprise a significant percentage of our management fees. This percentage has increased as a result of ARCC\u2019s acquisition of ACAS, which closed on January 3, 2017. The investment advisory agreement we have with ARCC categorizes the fees we receive as: (a) base management fees, which are paid quarterly and generally increase or decrease based on ARCC\u2019s total assets, (b) fees based on ARCC \u2019s net investment income (before ARCC Part I Fees and ARCC Part II Fees), which are paid quarterly (\u201cARCC Part I Fees\u201d) and (c) fees based on ARCC\u2019s net capital gains, which are paid annually (\u201cARCC Part II Fees\u201d). We classify the ARCC Part I Fees as management fees because they are paid quarterly, are predictable and recurring in nature, are not subject to repayment (or contingent repayment obligations) and are generally expected to be cash-settled each quarter. If ARCC\u2019s total assets or its net investment income were to decline significantly for any reason, including, without limitation, due to mark-to-market accounting requirements, the poor performance of its investments or the failure to successfully access or invest capital, the amount of the fees we receive from ARCC, including the base management fee and the ARCC Part I Fees, would also decline significantly and/or may be subject to deferral, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. In addition, because the ARCC Part II Fees are not paid unless ARCC achieves cumulative realized capital gains (net of realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation), ARCC\u2019s Part II Fees payable to us are variable and not predictable.\nOur investment advisory and management agreement with ARCC renews for successive annual periods subject to the approval of ARCC\u2019s board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of ARCC\u2019s outstanding voting securities. In addition, as required by the Investment Company Act, both ARCC and its investment adviser have the right to terminate the agreement without penalty upon 60 days\u2019 written notice to the other party. Termination or non-renewal of this\nagreement would reduce our revenues significantly and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees, which could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees. Although our investment management fees vary among and within asset classes, historically we have competed primarily on the basis of our performance and not on the level of our investment management fees relative to those of our competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a general trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry. In September 2009, the Institutional Limited Partners Association (\u201cILPA\u201d) published a set of Private Equity Principles (the \u201cPrinciples\u201d) which were revised in January 2011. The Principles were developed to encourage discussion between limited partners and general partners regarding private equity fund partnership terms. Certain of the Principles call for enhanced \u201calignment of interests\u201d between general partners and limited partners through modifications of some of the terms of fund arrangements, including proposed guidelines for fees and performance income structures. We promptly provided ILPA with our endorsement of the Principles, representing an indication of our general support for the efforts of ILPA. Although we have no obligation to modify any of our fees with respect to our existing funds, we may experience pressure to do so in our future funds. More recently, institutional investors have been increasing pressure to reduce management and investment fees charged by external managers, whether through direct reductions, deferrals, rebates or other means. We may not be successful in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new businesses could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations. For more information about our fees see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nInvestors in our funds may be unwilling to commit new capital to our funds because we are a public company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nSome investors in our funds may have concerns that as a public company our attention is bifurcated between investors in our funds and the public unitholders, resulting in potential conflicts of interest. Some investors in our funds may believe that as a public company we strive for near-term profit instead of superior risk-adjusted returns for investors in our funds over time or grow our assets under management for the purpose of generating additional management fees without regard to whether we believe there are sufficient investment opportunities to effectively deploy the additional capital. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to address such concerns or to convince investors in our funds that our status as a public company does not and will not affect our longstanding priorities or the way we conduct our businesses. A decision by a significant number of investors in our funds not to commit additional capital to our funds or to cease doing business with us altogether could inhibit our ability to achieve our investment objectives and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRapid growth of our businesses, particularly outside the United States, may be difficult to sustain and may place significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.\nOur assets under management have grown significantly in the past, and we are pursuing further growth in the near future, both organic and through acquisitions. Our rapid growth has placed, and planned growth, if successful, will continue to place, significant demands on our legal, accounting and operational infrastructure, and has increased expenses. The complexity of these demands, and the expense required to address them, is a function not simply of the amount by which our assets under management has grown, but of the growth in the variety and complexity of, as well as the differences in strategy between, our different funds. In addition, we are required to continuously develop our systems and infrastructure in response to the increasing sophistication of the investment management market and legal, accounting, regulatory and tax developments.\nOur future growth will depend in part on our ability to maintain an operating platform and management system sufficient to address our growth and will require us to incur significant additional expenses and to commit additional senior management and operational resources. As a result, we face significant challenges:\n\u2022\nin maintaining adequate financial, regulatory (legal, tax and compliance) and business controls;\n\u2022\nin providing current and future investors with accurate and consistent reporting;\n\u2022\nin implementing new or updated information and financial systems and procedures; and\n\u2022\nin training, managing and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our businesses on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nWe may not be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or be able to continue to grow, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses.\nIn addition, pursuing investment opportunities outside the United States presents challenges not faced by U.S. investments, such as different legal and tax regimes and currency fluctuations, which require additional resources to address. To accommodate the needs of global investors and strategies we must structure investment products in a manner that addresses tax, regulatory and legislative provisions in different, and sometimes multiple, jurisdictions. Further, in conducting business in foreign jurisdictions, we are often faced with the challenge of ensuring that our activities are consistent with U.S. or other laws with extraterritorial application, such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). Moreover, actively pursuing international investment opportunities may require that we increase the size or number of our international offices. Pursuing non-U.S. fund investors means that we must comply with international laws governing the sale of interests in our funds, different investor reporting and information processes and other requirements. As a result, we are required to continuously develop our systems and infrastructure, including employing and contracting with foreign businesses and entities, in response to the increasing complexity and sophistication of the investment management market and legal, accounting and regulatory situations. This growth has required, and will continue to require, us to incur significant additional expenses and to commit additional senior management and operational resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage or maintain appropriate oversight over our expanding international operations effectively or that we will be able to continue to grow this part of our businesses, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and control our expenses.\nWe may enter into new lines of business and expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nWe intend, if market conditions warrant, to grow our businesses by increasing assets under management in existing businesses and expanding into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses. Our partnership agreement permits us to enter into new lines of business, make strategic investments or acquisitions and enter into joint ventures. Accordingly, we may pursue growth through acquisitions of other investment management companies, acquisitions of critical business partners or other strategic initiatives, which may include entering into new lines of business. In addition, consistent with our past experience, we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other alternative or traditional asset managers.\nAttempts to expand our businesses involve a number of special risks, including some or all of the following:\n\u2022\nthe required investment of capital and other resources;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of liabilities in any acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of our ongoing businesses;\n\u2022\nentry into markets or lines of business in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nincreasing demands on our operational and management systems and controls;\n\u2022\ncompliance with additional regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\npotential increase in investor concentration; and\n\u2022\nthe broadening of our geographic footprint, increasing the risks associated with conducting operations in certain foreign jurisdictions where we currently have no presence.\nEntry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business does not generate sufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control. Because we have not yet identified these potential new investment strategies, geographic markets or lines of business, we cannot identify all of the specific risks we may face and the potential adverse consequences on us and their investment that may result from any attempted expansion.\nIf we are unable to consummate or successfully integrate development opportunities, acquisitions or joint ventures, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.\nOur growth strategy is based, in part, on the selective development or acquisition of asset management businesses, advisory businesses or other businesses complementary to our business where we think we can add substantial value or generate substantial returns. The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things: (a) the availability of suitable opportunities, (b) the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources, (c) our ability to value potential development or acquisition opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, (d) our ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and delays, (e) our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with venture partners, (f) our ability to properly manage conflicts of interest and (g) our ability to integrate personnel at acquired businesses into our\noperations and culture.\nThis strategy also contemplates the use of our publicly traded common units as acquisition consideration. Volatility or declines in the trading price of our common units may make our common units less attractive to acquisition targets. Moreover, even if we are able to identify and successfully complete an acquisition, we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs associated with integrating and overseeing the operations of the new businesses. If we are not successful in implementing our growth strategy, our business, financial results and the market price for our common units may be adversely affected.\nExtensive regulation in the United States affects our activities, increases the cost of doing business and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties that could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations, by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The SEC oversees the activities of our subsidiaries that are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Advisers Act\u201d). Since the first quarter of 2014, FINRA as well as the SEC has overseen the activities of our wholly owned subsidiary AIS as a registered broker-dealer. We are subject to audits by the Defense Security Service to determine whether we are under foreign ownership, control or influence. In addition, we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act, the Commodity Exchange Act and the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d). These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties who we do not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to be revoked or challenged or otherwise become unavailable to us, we could be subject to regulatory action or third-party claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. For example, in 2013 the SEC amended Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act to impose \u201cbad actor\u201d disqualification provisions that ban an issuer from offering or selling securities pursuant to the safe harbor in Rule 506 if the issuer, or any other \u201ccovered person,\u201d is the subject of a criminal, regulatory or court order or other \u201cdisqualifying event\u201d under the rule which has not been waived by the SEC. The definition of a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the rule includes an issuer\u2019s directors, general partners, managing members and executive officers and promoters and persons compensated for soliciting investors in the offering. Accordingly, our ability to rely on Rule 506 to offer or sell securities would be impaired if we or any \u201ccovered person\u201d is the subject of a disqualifying event under the rule and we are unable to obtain a waiver.\nThe SEC has indicated that investment advisors who receive transaction-based compensation for investment banking or acquisition activities relating to fund portfolio companies may be required to register as broker-dealers. Specifically, the SEC staff has noted that if a firm receives fees from a fund portfolio company in connection with the acquisition, disposition or recapitalization of such portfolio company, such activities could raise broker-dealer concerns under applicable regulations related to broker dealers. If we receive such transaction fees and the SEC takes the position that such activities render us a \u201cbroker\u201d under the applicable rules and regulations of the Exchange Act, we could be subject to additional regulation. If receipt of transaction fees from a portfolio company is determined to require a broker-dealer license, receipt of such transaction fees in the past or in the future during any time when we did not or do not have a broker-dealer license could subject us to liability for fines, penalties or damages.\nSince 2010, states and other regulatory authorities have begun to require investment managers to register as lobbyists. We have registered as such in a number of jurisdictions, including California, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Other states or municipalities may consider similar legislation or adopt regulations or procedures with similar effect. These registration requirements impose significant compliance obligations on registered lobbyists and their employers, which may include annual registration fees, periodic disclosure reports and internal recordkeeping, and may also prohibit the payment of contingent fees.\nEach of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular activities. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Investment Advisers Act, including recordkeeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, could result in investigations, sanctions and reputational damage. We are involved regularly in trading activities that implicate a broad number of U.S. and foreign securities and tax law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical trading requirements that implicate fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of these laws could result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation.\nCompliance with existing and new regulations subjects us to significant costs. Moreover, our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, including labor and employment laws, could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of the registration of our relevant subsidiaries as investment advisers or registered broker-dealers. The regulations to which our businesses are subject are designed primarily to protect investors in our funds and to ensure\nthe integrity of the financial markets. They are not designed to protect our unitholders. Even if a sanction is imposed against us, one of our subsidiaries or our personnel by a regulator for a small monetary amount, the costs incurred in responding to such matters could be material, the adverse publicity related to the sanction could harm our reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses in a number of ways, making it harder for us to raise new funds and discouraging others from doing business with us.\nIn the past several years, the financial services industry, and private equity in particular, has been the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators around the globe. In particular, the SEC and its staff have focused more narrowly on issues relevant to alternative asset management firms, including by forming specialized units devoted to examining such firms and, in certain cases, bringing enforcement actions against the firms, their principals and employees. In recent periods there have been a number of enforcement actions within the industry, and it is expected that the SEC will continue to pursue enforcement actions against private fund managers. This increased enforcement activity may cause us to reevaluate certain practices and adjust our compliance control function as necessary and appropriate.\nWhile the SEC\u2019s recent list of examination priorities includes such items as cyber security compliance and controls and conducting risk-based examinations of never-before-examined investment advisory firms, it is generally expected that the SEC\u2019s oversight of alternative asset managers will continue to focus substantially on concerns related to transparency and investor disclosure practices. Although the SEC has cited improvements in disclosures and industry practices in this area, it has also indicated that there is room for improvement in particular areas, including fees and expenses (and the allocation of such fees and expenses) and co-investment practices. To this end, many firms have received inquiries during examinations or directly from the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement regarding various transparency-related topics, including the acceleration of monitoring fees, the allocation of broken-deal expenses, the disclosure of operating partner or operating executive compensation, outside business activities of firm principals and employees, group purchasing arrangements and general conflicts of interest disclosures. In addition, our Private Equity funds have engaged in the past and may engage from time to time advisors who often work with our investment teams during due diligence, provide board-level governance and support and advise portfolio company leadership. Advisors generally are third parties and typically retained by us pursuant to consulting agreements. In some cases, an operating executive may be retained by a portfolio company directly and in such instances the portfolio company may compensate the operating executive directly (meaning that investors in our Private Equity funds may indirectly bear the operating executive\u2019s compensation). While we believe we have made appropriate and timely disclosures regarding the engagement and compensation of these advisors, the SEC staff may disagree.\nRegulations governing ARCC\u2019s operation as a business development company affect its ability to raise, and the way in which it raises, additional capital.\nAs a business development company, ARCC operates as a highly regulated business within the provisions of the Investment Company Act. Many of the regulations governing business development companies have not been modernized within recent securities laws amendments and restrict, among other things, leverage incurrence, co-investments and other transactions with other entities within the Ares Operating Group. Certain of our funds may be restricted from engaging in transactions with ARCC and its subsidiaries.\nAs a business development company registered under the Investment Company Act, ARCC may issue debt securities or preferred stock and borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as \u201csenior securities,\u201d up to the maximum amount permitted by the Investment Company Act. Under the provisions of the Investment Company Act, ARCC is permitted, as a business development company, to incur indebtedness or issue senior securities only in amounts such that its asset coverage, as calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act, equals at least 200% after each such incurrence or issuance. If the value of its assets declines, it may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, it may be required to sell a portion of its investments and, depending on the nature of its leverage, repay a portion of its indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. Business development companies may issue and sell common stock at a price below net asset value per share only in limited circumstances, one of which is during an approximately one-year period after obtaining stockholder approval for such issuance in accordance with the Investment Company Act. ARCC\u2019s stockholders have, in the past, approved such issuances so that during the subsequent 12-month period, ARCC may, in one or more public or private offerings of its common stock, sell or otherwise issue shares of its common stock at a price below the then-current net asset value per share, subject to certain conditions including parameters on the level of permissible dilution, approval of the sale by a majority of its independent directors and a requirement that the sale price be not less than approximately the market price of the shares of its common stock at specified times, less the expenses of the sale. ARCC may ask its stockholders for additional approvals from year to year. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained.\nOur publicly traded investment vehicles are subject to regulatory complexities that limit the way in which they do business and may subject them to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny.\nOur publicly traded investment vehicles operate under a complex regulatory environment. Such companies require the application of complex tax and securities regulations and may entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny. In addition, regulations affecting our publicly traded investment vehicles generally affect their ability to take certain actions. For example, certain of our publicly traded vehicles have elected to be treated as a REIT or RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To maintain their status as a RIC or a REIT, such vehicles must meet, among other things, certain source of income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. ARCC and our publicly traded closed-end fund are subject to complex rules under the Investment Company Act, including rules that restrict certain of our funds from engaging in transactions with ARCC or the closed-end fund. ARCC is required to generally distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income to maintain its RIC status and, subject to certain exceptions, ARCC is generally prohibited from issuing and selling its common stock at a price below net asset value per share and from incurring indebtedness (including for this purpose, preferred stock), if ARCC\u2019s asset coverage, as calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act, equals less than 200% after such incurrence.\nFailure to comply with \u201cpay to play\u201d regulations implemented by the SEC and certain states, and changes to the \u201cpay to play\u201d regulatory regimes, could adversely affect our businesses.\nIn recent years, the SEC and several states have initiated investigations alleging that certain private equity firms and hedge funds or agents acting on their behalf have paid money to current or former government officials or their associates in exchange for improperly soliciting contracts with state pension funds. In June 2010, the SEC approved Rule 206(4)-5 under the Investment Advisers Act regarding \u201cpay to play\u201d practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to government officials able to exert influence on potential government entity clients. Among other restrictions, the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government entity for two years, subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make contributions to certain candidates and officials in a position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government entity. Advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain of the adviser\u2019s employees and engagements of third parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records to enable the SEC to determine compliance with the rule. In addition, there have been similar rules on a state level regarding \u201cpay to play\u201d practices by investment advisers.\nSimilar rule-making and investigations have also occurred in New York. In March 2007, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (the \u201cNY Attorney General\u201d) commenced an industry-wide investigation into pay to play allegations and undisclosed conflicts of interest at public pension funds, including the New York State Common Retirement Fund. As a consequence of the NY Attorney General\u2019s investigation, the NY Attorney General adopted a Public Pension Fund Reform Code of Conduct (the \u201cReform Code of Conduct\u201d) for U.S. public pension funds. This Reform Code of Conduct, among other things, restricts the use of third-party intermediaries and placement agents with respect to the solicitation of funds from U.S. public pension funds. In 2010, we agreed to adopt the Reform Code of Conduct, acknowledging that the Reform Code of Conduct would enhance transparency in fundraising activities before public pension funds on a national basis. As a signatory to the Reform Code of Conduct, we may be at a disadvantage to other fund sponsors that are not similarly restricted from engaging third-party solicitors, notwithstanding that many states and public pension funds have adopted similar restrictions. FINRA also recently proposed its own set of \u201cpay to play\u201d regulations that are similar to the SEC\u2019s regulations.\nAs we have a significant number of public pension plans that are investors in our funds, these rules could impose significant economic sanctions on our businesses if we or one of the other persons covered by the rules make any such contribution or payment, whether or not material or with an intent to secure an investment from a public pension plan. We may also acquire other investment managers who are not subject to the same restrictions as us, but whose activity, and the activity of their principals, prior to our ownership could affect our fundraising. In addition, such investigations may require the attention of senior management and may result in fines if any of our funds are deemed to have violated any regulations, thereby imposing additional expenses on us. Any failure on our part to comply with these rules could cause us to lose compensation for our advisory services or expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the new Basel III capital standards is uncertain.\nIn June 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, an international trade body comprised of senior representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks from 27 countries, including the United States and the EU, announced the final framework for a comprehensive set of capital and liquidity standards, commonly referred to as \u201cBasel III,\u201d for internationally active banking organizations and certain other types of financial institutions. These new standards, which will be fully phased in by 2019, will require banks to hold more capital, predominantly in the form of common equity, than under the\ncurrent capital framework. Implementation of Basel III will require implementing regulations and guidelines by member countries. In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking regulators announced the adoption of final regulations to implement Basel III for U.S. banking organizations, subject to various transition periods. The EU implemented Basel III in June 2013. In April 2014, U.S. regulators adopted rules requiring enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards beginning in January 2018, which would impose capital requirements more stringent than those of the Basel III standards for the most systematically significant banking organizations in the United States. In January 2016, the Basel Committee published its revised capital requirements for market risk, known as Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (\u201cFRTB\u201d), which are expected to generally result in higher global capital requirements for banks that could, in turn, reduce liquidity and increase financing and hedging costs. The impact of FRTB will not be known until after any resulting rules are finalized by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. Compliance with the Basel III standards, the supplemental regulatory standards adopted by U.S. regulators and FRTB may result in significant costs to banking organizations, which in turn may result in higher borrowing costs for the private sector and reduced access to certain types of credit.\nRegulatory changes and other developments in the United States and regulatory compliance failures could adversely affect our reputation, businesses and operations.\nIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law and has imposed significant regulations on nearly every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act established a ten voting-member Financial Stability Oversight Council (the \u201cCouncil\u201d), an interagency body chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, to identify and manage systemic risk in the financial system and improve interagency cooperation. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Council has the authority to review the activities of certain nonbank financial firms engaged in financial activities that are designated as \u201csystemically important,\u201d meaning, among other things, evaluating the impact of the distress of the financial firm on the stability of the U.S. economy. If we were designated as such, it would result in increased regulation of our businesses, including the imposition of capital, leverage, liquidity and risk management standards, credit exposure reporting and concentration limits, restrictions on acquisitions and annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve.\nIn October 2011, the Federal Reserve and other federal regulatory agencies issued a proposed rule implementing a section of the Dodd-Frank Act that has become known as the \u201cVolcker Rule.\u201d In December 2013, the Federal Reserve and other federal regulatory agencies adopted a final rule implementing the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule generally prohibits insured banks or thrifts, any bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, any non-U.S. bank with a U.S. branch, agency or commercial lending company and any subsidiaries and affiliates of such entities, regardless of geographic location, from investing in or sponsoring \u201ccovered funds,\u201d which include private equity funds or hedge funds and certain other proprietary activities. The effects of the Volcker Rule are uncertain but it is in any event likely to curtail various banking activities that in turn could result in uncertainties in the financial markets as well as our business. The final Volcker Rule became effective on April 1, 2014 and is subject to a conformance period (ending July 21, 2017). It contains exemptions for certain \u201cpermitted activities\u201d that would enable certain institutions subject to the Volcker Rule to continue investing in covered funds under certain conditions. Although we do not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will adversely affect our fundraising to any significant extent, there is uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Volcker Rule and its practical implications, and there could be adverse implications on our ability to raise funds from the types of entities mentioned above as a result of this prohibition.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, regulation of the U.S. derivatives market is bifurcated between the CFTC and the SEC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has jurisdiction over swaps and the SEC has jurisdiction over security-based swaps. As part of its Dodd-Frank Act related rule-making process, the CFTC made changes to its rules with respect to the registration and oversight of CPOs. As a result of the CFTC\u2019s revisions to these rules, all swaps (other than security-based swaps) are now included in the definition of commodity interests. As a result, funds that utilize swaps (whether or not related to a physical commodity) as part of their business model may fall within the statutory definition of a commodity pool. If a fund qualifies as a commodity pool, then, absent an available exemption, the operator of such fund is required to register with the CFTC as a CPO. Registration with the CFTC renders such CPO subject to regulation, including with respect to disclosure, reporting, recordkeeping and business conduct, which could significantly increase operating costs by requiring additional resources.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulatory authorities to promulgate certain rules relating to the regulation of the derivatives market. Such rules require or will require the registration of certain market participants, the clearing of certain derivatives contracts through central counterparties, the execution of certain derivatives contracts on electronic platforms, as well as reporting and recordkeeping of derivatives transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides expanded enforcement authority to the CFTC and SEC. While certain rules have been promulgated and are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is still ongoing. In particular, the CFTC has finalized most of its rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, and the SEC has proposed a number of rules regarding security-based swaps but has only finalized some of these rules. We cannot therefore yet predict the ultimate effect of the rules and regulations on our business.\nUnder CFTC and SEC rules, an entity may be required to register as a MSP or MSBSP if it has substantial swaps or security-based swaps positions or has substantial counterparty exposure from its swaps or security-based swaps positions. If any of our funds were required to register as an MSP or MSBSP, it could make compliance more expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our businesses and adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, if any of our funds qualify as \u201cspecial entities\u201d under CFTC rules, it could make it more difficult for them to enter into derivatives transactions or make such transactions more expensive.\nPursuant to rules finalized by the CFTC in December 2012 and September 2016, certain classes of interest rate swaps and certain classes of credit default swaps are subject to mandatory clearing, unless an exemption applies. Many of these swaps are also subject to mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities. At this time, the CFTC has not proposed any rules designating other classes of swaps for mandatory clearing, but it may do so in the future. Mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use, and exposes our funds to the credit risk of the clearing house through which any cleared swap is cleared. In addition, federal bank regulatory authorities and the CFTC have adopted initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers, security-based swap dealers and swap entities, including permissible forms of margin, custodial arrangements and documentation requirements for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps. As a result, swap entities will be required to collect margin for transactions and positions in uncleared swaps and security-based swaps by financial end users. The new rules will become effective for end users on March 1, 2017. On February 13, 2017, the CFTC\u2019s Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight announced a grace period until September 1, 2017, to comply with the variation margin requirements for swaps that are subject to a March 1, 2017 compliance date. The effect of the regulations on us is not fully known at this time. However, these rules may increase the cost of our activity in uncleared swaps and security-based swaps to the extent we are determined to be a financial end user.\nIn December 2016, the CFTC reproposed rules that would set federal position limits for certain referenced contracts, and issued final rules on aggregation among entities under common ownership or control, for position limits on certain futures and options contracts that would apply to the proposed position limits on referenced contracts. It is possible that the CFTC could propose to expand such requirements to other types of contracts in the future. If any when enacted, the proposal could affect our ability and the ability for our funds to enter into derivatives transactions.\nThe CFTC has finalized rules requiring collateral used to margin cleared swaps to be segregated in a manner different from that applicable to the futures market and has finalized other rules allowing parties to an uncleared swap to require that any collateral posted as initial margin be segregated with a third party custodian. Collateral segregation may impose greater costs on us when entering into swaps.\nFinally, the Dodd-Frank Act gave the CFTC expanded anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority, including authority over disruptive trading practices and insider trading. Several investigations have commenced in the United States related to manipulation of the foreign exchange, LIBOR and indices markets. It is possible that new standards will emerge from these proceedings that could impact the way that we trade.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act authorizes federal regulatory agencies to review and, in certain cases, prohibit compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct deemed to encourage inappropriate risk-taking by covered financial institutions. Federal bank regulatory authorities and the SEC have proposed a rule to implement the law that generally (1) prohibits incentive-based payment arrangements that are determined to encourage inappropriate risks by certain financial institutions by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss and (2) requires those financial institutions to disclose information concerning incentive-based compensation arrangements to the appropriate Federal regulator. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires public companies to adopt and disclose policies requiring, in the event the company is required to issue an accounting restatement, the contingent repayment obligations of related incentive compensation from current and former executive officers. Such restrictions could limit our ability to recruit and retain investment professionals and senior management executives.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act amends the Exchange Act to compensate and protect whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information to the SEC and establishes a fund to be used to pay whistleblowers who will be entitled to receive a payment equal to between 10% and 30% of certain monetary sanctions imposed in a successful government action resulting from the information provided by the whistleblower.\nThe SEC requires investment advisers registered or required to register with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act that advise one or more private funds and have at least $150.0 million in private fund assets under management to periodically file reports on Form PF. We have filed, and will continue to file, quarterly reports on Form PF, which has resulted in increased administrative costs and requires a significant amount of attention and time to be spent by our personnel.\nMany of these provisions are subject to further rulemaking and to the discretion of regulatory bodies, such as the Council and the Federal Reserve. On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order addressing regulation of the U.S. financial system. The order purports to give the Department of the Treasury the authority to restructure major provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The ultimate impact of this order and its implementation on existing and proposed regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act and other rules and regulations applicable to the U.S. financial system are uncertain; however, such impact could be material to our industry, business and operations.\nIt is difficult to determine the full extent of the impact on us of the Dodd-Frank Act or any other new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law. In addition, as a result of proposed legislation, shifting areas of focus of regulatory enforcement bodies or otherwise, regulatory compliance practices may shift such that formerly accepted industry practices become disfavored or less common. Any changes or other developments in the regulatory framework applicable to our businesses, including the changes described above and changes to formerly accepted industry practices, may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which we conduct our businesses. Moreover, as calls for additional regulation have increased, there may be a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative asset management funds, including our funds. In addition, we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our businesses and adversely affect our profitability.\nRegulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the United States could adversely affect our businesses.\nCertain of our subsidiaries operate outside the United States. In the United Kingdom, Ares Management Limited and Ares Management UK Limited are subject to regulation by the FCA. Ares European Loan Management LLP, which is not a subsidiary, but in which we are indirectly invested and which procures certain services from Ares Management Limited, is also subject to regulation by the FCA. In some circumstances, Ares Management Limited, Ares Management UK Limited, Ares European Loan Management LLP and other Ares entities are or become subject to UK or EU laws, for instance in relation to marketing our funds to investors in the EEA.\nEuropean Union legislation could impact our business in the United Kingdom and in other EEA member states where we have operations. The following measures are of particular relevance to our business.\nIn March 2013, the predecessor regulator to the FCA published the final rules for the FCA\u2019s regulation and supervision of the LIBOR. In particular, the FCA\u2019s LIBOR rules include requirements that (1) an independent LIBOR administrator monitor and survey LIBOR submissions to identify breaches of practice standards and/or potentially manipulative behavior, and (2) firms submitting data to LIBOR establish and maintain a clear conflicts of interest policy and appropriate systems and controls. These requirements may cause LIBOR to be more volatile than it has been in the past, which may adversely affect the value of investments made by our funds. On February 3, 2014, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited took responsibility for administering LIBOR, following regulatory authorization by the FCA.\nThe Benchmarks Regulation entered into force on June 30, 2016. It aims to introduce a common framework and consistent approach to benchmark regulation across the EU by regulating producers, contributors to and users of benchmarks. The Benchmarks Regulation will replace the current UK framework regulating LIBOR and other specified benchmarks, notably the EURIBOR. Certain requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation have already entered into force, but the majority will apply beginning January 1, 2018. Although there are measures in the Benchmarks Regulation which are designed to prevent certain benchmarks from being undermined by a material reduction of benchmark contributors, it is not yet clear how successful these will be. The Benchmarks Regulation may therefore lead to unpredictable developments in relation to LIBOR and certain other benchmarks, which could affect the value of investments made by our funds.\nThe Directive and CRD IV could restrict the ability of banks and alternative investment funds (\u201cAIFs\u201d) managed in the EU to invest in securitization vehicles including collateralized loan obligations operated by us unless either the \u201coriginator\u201d, \u201coriginal lender\u201d or \u201csponsor\u201d (as those terms are defined in the legislation) retains a prescribed interest in the securitization concerned. Where such securitization arrangements are managed by Ares affiliated undertakings, this risk retention requirement will, at present, need to be held by an appropriately (EU) authorized and regulated entity affiliated with us (i.e., as \u201csponsor\u201d). The holding of that retention on our affiliate\u2019s balance sheet is likely to increase that entity\u2019s regulatory capital requirement and will accordingly adversely affect return on equity. In September 2015, the European Commission published proposals for a new securitization regulation as part of the Securitisation Regulation. The text of the Securitisation Regulation continues to be negotiated and no single compromise text yet exists. Measures likely to be included in the final text include a proposal for a new \"direct approach\" to securitization retention requirements for lenders, originators and sponsors, placing them under a direct obligation to hold the retention slice (rather than creating an indirect obligation through increased capital requirements for EU investors in non-\ncompliant securitizations). There is also likely to be new investor transparency requirements which would require additional information to be disclosed to investors. Compliance with the proposed new requirements in the securitization regulation may result in us incurring material costs.\nThe EU Regulation on OTC derivative transactions, central counterparties and trade repositories (commonly known as EMIR) will require the mandatory clearing of certain OTC derivatives through central counterparties. Beginning June 21, 2017, this mandatory clearing obligation will begin to apply to certain Ares-affiliated undertakings that enter into an eligible derivative transaction with another financial counterparty or a non-financial counterparty whose OTC derivative exposures exceed a prescribed clearing threshold, although the implementation of this requirement may be subject to a delay. EMIR will further require certain Ares-affiliated undertakings to provide margin in respect of OTC derivative transactions that are not cleared by a central counterparty by March 1, 2017. EMIR does not have a material impact on Ares-affiliated undertakings at present, although as these implementation dates are reached the cost of complying with the requirements is likely to increase.\nOn January 29, 2014, the European Commission published a proposal for a new regulation dealing with structural measures to improve the resilience of EU credit institutions, known as the Banking Structural Regulation. Provisions in the proposed regulation would prohibit systemically important EU banks from acquiring, owning, sponsoring or having an exposure to an AIF, unless that AIF is unleveraged, closed-ended and either established in the EEA or, if it is not established in the EEA, marketed in the EEA. There has been considerable political disagreement in relation to the legislative proposals and the precise scope of this proposed regulation and its timescale for coming into force is currently uncertain. However, the European Parliament and European Council are aiming to seek political agreement during 2017. The final proposals, if adopted, may affect our ability to raise capital in our funds from EU banks.\nOn December 14, 2015, the European Banking Authority published guidelines which are relevant to, amongst other things, EU banks' exposures to shadow banking entities. These guidelines have applied since January 1, 2017. The definition of shadow banking entity is extremely wide and could potentially catch a number of different entities, including investment funds and securitization vehicles. AIFs are excluded from the definition of a shadow banking entity unless they: (1) deploy leverage within the meaning of the Directive on a substantial basis; or (2) are permitted to originate loans or purchase third party lending exposures onto their balance sheet pursuant to the relevant fund rules or constitutional documents. These guidelines may affect our ability to raise capital in certain of our funds from EU banks.\nOur UK, other European and Asian operations and our investment activities worldwide are subject to a variety of regulatory regimes that vary by country. In addition, we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the regulations of certain foreign countries in conducting our asset management activities.\nEach of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular activities. We are involved regularly in trading activities that implicate a broad number of foreign (as well as U.S.) securities law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information and market manipulation and a broad number of technical trading requirements that implicate fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of these laws could result in severe restrictions or prohibitions on our activities and damage to our reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses in a number of ways, making it harder for us to raise new funds and discouraging others from doing business with us. In addition, increasing global regulatory oversight of fundraising activities, including local registration requirements in various jurisdictions and the addition of new compliance regimes, could make it more difficult for us to raise new funds or could increase the cost of raising such funds.\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive\nThe Directive was enacted in July 2011 and took effect on July 22, 2013. The Directive applies to (1) AIFMs established in the EEA that manage EEA or non-EEA AIFs, (2) non-EEA AIFMs that manage EEA AIFs and (c) non-EEA AIFMs that market their AIFs to professional investors within the EEA.\nBeginning July 22, 2013, the Directive imposed new operating requirements the categories of AIFMs listed in (1) and (2) in the paragraph above. In addition, each of the AIFMs identified in (1), (2) and (3) of the paragraph above will need to comply with the Directive\u2019s disclosure and transparency requirements when seeking to market within the EEA and, in the case of non-EEA AIFMs seeking to market under jurisdiction specific private placement regimes, additional jurisdiction specific requirements where these exist (e.g., appointing a depositary).\nThe full scope of the Directive may also be extended on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis to non-EEA AIFMs that wish to market an AIF within the EEA pursuant to a pan-European marketing passport. In July 2016, the ESMA published advice to\nEU institutions on extending the passport to certain non-EU jurisdictions. This included positive assessments in respect of extending the passport under the Directive to five non-EEA jurisdictions, which notably did not include the United States or the Cayman Islands. ESMA expressed a qualified assessment in respect of the United States due to concerns about reciprocity of market access. ESMA gave no assessment in respect of the Cayman Islands. The European Commission was expected and arguably required to publish legislation before the end of October 2016 setting a date for the pan-European marketing passport to be made available, at least in respect of the five non-EEA jurisdictions it had assessed positively. It did not publish this legislation in 2016 and, due to a number of reasons, it is unclear when legislation will be implemented to develop the non-EEA AIFM passport.\nCertain of the jurisdiction specific private placement regimes may cease to exist when the non-EEA AIFM passport becomes available. This development could have a negative impact on our ability to raise capital from EEA investors if, for example, a jurisdiction specific private placement regime ceases to operate and the non-EEA AIFM passport is not made available to United States AIFMs.\nThe operating requirements imposed by the Directive include, amongst other things, rules relating to the remuneration of certain personnel, minimum regulatory capital requirements, restrictions on the use of leverage, restrictions on early distributions relating to portfolio companies (so-called \u201casset stripping rules\u201d), disclosure and reporting requirements to both investors and home state regulators, the independent valuation of an AIF\u2019s assets and the appointment of an independent depository to hold assets. As a result, the Directive increases the regulatory burden and the cost of doing business for Ares Management UK Limited and, to a more limited extent, non-EEA AIFMs which market non-EEA AIFs under EEA private placement regimes. This potentially disadvantages our funds as investors in private companies located in EEA member states when compared to non-AIF/AIFM competitors that may not be subject to the requirements of the Directive, thereby potentially restricting our funds\u2019 ability to invest in such companies.\nThe Directive allows AIFMs to invest in securitizations on behalf of the alternative investment funds they manage, only if the originator, sponsor or original lender for the securitization has explicitly disclosed that it will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than 5% of the nominal value of the securitized exposures or of the tranches sold to investors and certain due diligence undertakings are made. AIFMs that discover after the assumption of a securitization exposure that the retained interest does not meet the requirements, or subsequently falls below 5% of the economic risk, are required to take such corrective action as is in the best interests of investors. It remains to be seen how AIFMs will address requirement in practice should these circumstances arise. These requirements, along with other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of securitizations, may negatively affect the value of investments made by our funds.\nThe Directive could also limit our operating flexibility and our investment opportunities, as well as expose us and/or our funds to conflicting regulatory requirements in the United States (and elsewhere).\nSolvency II\nSolvency II sets out stronger capital adequacy and risk management requirements for European insurers and reinsurers and, in particular, dictates how much capital such firms must hold against their liabilities and introduces a risk-based assessment of those liabilities. Solvency II came into force on January 1, 2010 but was only required to be implemented by firms on January 1, 2016. There are also a number of transitional provisions designed to avoid market disruption. Solvency II imposes, amongst other things, substantially greater quantitative and qualitative capital requirements for insurers and reinsurers as well as other supervisory and disclosure requirements. We are not subject to Solvency II; however, many of our European insurer or reinsurer fund investors are subject to this directive, as applied under applicable domestic law. Solvency II may impact insurers\u2019 and reinsurers\u2019 investment decisions and their asset allocations. In addition, insurers and reinsurers will be subject to more onerous data collation and reporting requirements. As a result, Solvency II could have an adverse indirect effect on our businesses by, amongst other things, restricting the ability of European insurers and reinsurers to invest in our funds and imposing on us extensive disclosure and reporting obligations for those insurers and reinsurers that do invest in our funds. The final details and requirements of the subsidiary regulations pursuant to Solvency II remain uncertain and are subject to change as a result of enactment both of related EU legislation, guidelines and national implementing legislation in EEA member states.\nMiFID II\nThe recast Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (collectively referred to as MiFID II) will come into effect beginning January 3, 2018. MiFID II will amend the existing MiFID regime and, amongst other requirements, will introduce new organizational and operational requirements for investment firms in the EEA. Compliance with these new rules may require updates to existing procedures, systems and controls and the development of new internal systems, which may include substantial automated and electronic systems, and is likely to involve material costs to the business.\nThe recent vote in the UK to exit from the EU could adversely affect our business and our operations.\nThe recent vote by the electorate in a referendum in the UK to exit from the EU (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) could disrupt our business and operations, including the liquidity and value of our investments. Since its announcement, Brexit has caused significant geo-political uncertainty and market volatility in the UK and elsewhere. Although the referendum is non-binding, the UK\u2019s leadership has indicated that it expects Brexit to be passed into law and to commence negotiations with the EU to determine the future terms, including with respect to trade, of the UK\u2019s ongoing relationship with the EU. These negotiations are expected to take a number of years, which could prolong the related uncertainty and volatility, which among other things, could affect the pace of capital deployment and investment realizations.\nDepending on the outcome of these negotiations, the UK could lose access to the single EU market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the operations of our portfolio companies. For example, a decline in trade could affect the attractiveness of the UK as a global investment center and, as a result, could make doing business in Europe more difficult. In addition, our current and prospective funds could lose their AIFMD marketing passport, which provides them the license to market funds across borders within the single EU market without obtaining local regulatory approval. The movement of capital and the mobility of personnel may also be restricted. These and other by-products of Brexit, such as the tightening of credit in the UK commercial real estate market, may also increase the costs of having operations, conducting business and making investments in the UK and Europe. As a result, the performance of our funds which are focused on investing in the UK and to a lesser extent across Europe, such as certain funds in our Credit and Real Estate Groups may be disproportionately affected compared to those funds that invest more broadly across global geographies or are focused on different regions.\nThe Brexit vote has also caused exchange rate fluctuations that have resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business, including the British pound and the Euro. Where un-hedged, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may, among other things, adversely affect the results of operations of our funds and investments that are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies and also adversely affect businesses that rely on the strength of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, and thereby have a negative impact on our investments in those businesses. Movements in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar currencies affect the management fees earned by funds with fee earning AUM denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies as well as by funds with fee earning AUM denominated in U.S. dollars that hold investments denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Additionally, movements in exchange rates affect operating expenses for our foreign offices that are denominated in non-U.S. currencies, cash balances we hold in non-U.S. currencies and investments we hold in non-U.S. currencies.\nFurther, the UK\u2019s determination as to which, if any, EU laws to repeal, retain, replace or replicate upon its exit from the EU could exacerbate the uncertainty and result in divergent national laws and regulations. Changes to the regulatory regimes in the UK or the EU and its member states could materially affect our business prospects and opportunities and increase our costs. In addition, Brexit could potentially disrupt the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and affect the tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions in a manner that is adverse to us and/or our funds. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks in using prime brokers, custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents.\nMany of our funds depend on the services of prime brokers, custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents to carry out certain securities and derivatives transactions. The terms of these contracts are often customized and complex, and many of these arrangements occur in markets or relate to products that are not subject to regulatory oversight, although the Dodd-Frank Act provides for new regulation of the derivatives market. In particular, some of our funds utilize prime brokerage arrangements with a relatively limited number of counterparties, which has the effect of concentrating the transaction volume (and related counterparty default risk) of these funds with these counterparties.\nOur funds are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the contract. Any such default may occur suddenly and without notice to us. Moreover, if a counterparty defaults, we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because we lack contractual recourse or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. This inability could occur in times of market stress, which is when defaults are most likely to occur.\nIn addition, our risk-management models may not accurately anticipate the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition, and as a result, we may not have taken sufficient action to reduce our risks effectively. Default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, foresee or evaluate. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one large participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants, which may in turn expose us to significant losses.\nAlthough we have risk-management models and processes to ensure that we are not exposed to a single counterparty for significant periods of time, given the large number and size of our funds, we often have large positions with a single counterparty. For example, most of our funds have credit lines. If the lender under one or more of those credit lines were to become insolvent, we may have difficulty replacing the credit line and one or more of our funds may face liquidity problems.\nIn the event of a counterparty default, particularly a default by a major investment bank or a default by a counterparty to a significant number of our contracts, one or more of our funds may have outstanding trades that they cannot settle or are delayed in settling. As a result, these funds could incur material losses and the resulting market impact of a major counterparty default could harm our businesses, results of operation and financial condition.\nIn the event of the insolvency of a prime broker, custodian, counterparty or any other party that is holding assets of our funds as collateral, our funds might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the prime broker\u2019s, custodian\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s unsecured creditors in relation to the assets held as collateral. In addition, our funds\u2019 cash held with a prime broker, custodian or counterparty generally will not be segregated from the prime broker\u2019s, custodian\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s own cash, and our funds may therefore rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto. If our derivatives transactions are cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, the CFTC has issued final rules regulating the segregation and protection of collateral posted by customers of cleared and uncleared swaps. The CFTC is also working to provide new guidance regarding prime broker arrangements and intermediation generally with regard to trading on swap execution facilities.\nThe counterparty risks that we face have increased in complexity and magnitude as a result of disruption in the financial markets in recent years. For example, the consolidation and elimination of counterparties has increased our concentration of counterparty risk and decreased the universe of potential counterparties, and our funds are generally not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty. In addition, counterparties have generally reacted to recent market volatility by tightening their underwriting standards and increasing their margin requirements for all categories of financing, which has the result of decreasing the overall amount of leverage available and increasing the costs of borrowing.\nA portion of our revenue, net income and cash flow is variable, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of our common units to decline.\nA portion of our revenue, net income and cash flow is variable, primarily due to the fact that the performance fees that we receive from certain of our funds can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. In addition, the investment returns of most of our funds are volatile. We may also experience fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of other factors, including changes in the values of our funds\u2019 investments, changes in the amount of distributions, dividends or interest paid in respect of investments, changes in our operating expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions. Such variability may lead to volatility in the trading price of our common units and cause our results for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in a future period. It may be difficult for us to achieve steady growth in net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis, which could in turn lead to large adverse movements in the price of our common units or increased volatility in the price of our common units generally.\nThe timing and amount of performance fees generated by our funds is uncertain and contributes to the volatility of our results. It takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities, to raise all the funds needed to make an investment and then to realize the cash value or other proceeds of an investment through a sale, public offering, recapitalization or other exit. Even if an investment proves to be profitable, it may be several years before any profits can be realized in cash or other proceeds. We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur. If we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter or year, it may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter or year that may not be replicated in subsequent periods. We recognize revenue on investments in our funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains (or losses) reported by such funds, and a decline in realized or unrealized gains, or an increase in realized or unrealized losses, would adversely affect our revenue, which could increase the volatility of our results.\nWith respect to our funds that generate carried interest, the timing and receipt of such carried interest varies with the life cycle of our funds. During periods in which a relatively large portion of our assets under management is attributable to funds and investments in their \u201charvesting\u201d period, our funds would make larger distributions than in the fund-raising or investment periods that precede harvesting. During periods in which a significant portion of our assets under management is attributable to funds that are not in their harvesting periods, we may receive substantially lower carried interest distributions. Moreover in some cases, we receive carried interest payments only upon realization of investments by the relevant fund, which contributes to the volatility of our cash flow and in other funds we are only entitled to carried interest payments after a return of all contributions and a preferred return to investors.\nWith respect to our funds that pay an incentive fee, the incentive fee is generally paid annually. In many cases, we earn this incentive fee only if the net asset value of a fund has increased or, in the case of certain funds, increased beyond a particular threshold. Some of our funds also have \u201chigh water marks\u201d. If the high water mark for a particular fund is not surpassed, we would not earn an incentive fee with respect to that fund during a particular period even if the fund had positive returns in such period as a result of losses in prior periods. If the fund were to experience losses, we would not be able to earn an incentive fee from such fund until it surpassed the previous high water mark. The incentive fees we earn are, therefore, dependent on the net asset value of our fund investments, which could lead to significant volatility in our results. Finally, the timing and amount of incentive fees generated by our closed-end funds are uncertain and will contribute to the volatility of our net income. Incentive fees depend on our closed-end funds\u2019 investment performance and opportunities for realizing gains, which may be limited.\nBecause a portion of our revenue, net income and cash flow can be variable from quarter to quarter and year to year, we do not plan to provide any guidance regarding our expected quarterly and annual operating results. The lack of guidance may affect the expectations of public market analysts and could cause increased volatility in the price of our common units.\nWe may be subject to litigation risks and may face liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result.\nIn recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against investment managers have been increasing. We make investment decisions on behalf of investors in our funds that could result in substantial losses. This may subject us to the risk of legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty or breach of contract. Further, we may be subject to third-party litigation arising from allegations that we improperly exercised control or influence over portfolio investments. In addition, we and our affiliates that are the investment managers and general partners of our funds, our funds themselves and those of our employees who are our, our subsidiaries\u2019 or the funds\u2019 officers and directors are each exposed to the risks of litigation specific to the funds\u2019 investment activities and portfolio companies and, in the case where our funds own controlling interests in public companies, to the risk of shareholder litigation by the public companies\u2019 other shareholders. Moreover, we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors or regulators relating to our having engaged, or our funds having engaged, in transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed.\nLegal liability could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition or results of operations or cause reputational harm to us, which could harm our businesses. We depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the investment industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be damaging to our businesses.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nOur ability to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds depends heavily upon the reputation of our professionals, especially our senior professionals. We are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our investment management business and our authority over the assets managed by our investment management business. Further, our employees are subject to various internal policies including a Code of Ethics and policies covering information systems, business continuity and information security. The violation of these obligations, standards and policies by any of our employees could adversely affect investors in our funds and us. Our businesses often require that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which our funds may invest. If our employees or former employees were to use or disclose confidential information improperly, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct, and the extensive precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If one or more of our employees or former employees were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, our businesses and our reputation could be adversely affected and a loss of investor confidence could result, which would adversely impact our ability to raise future funds.\nFraud and other deceptive practices or other misconduct at our portfolio companies, properties or projects could similarly subject us to liability and reputational damage and also harm our businesses.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Commission have devoted greater resources to enforcement of the FCPA. In addition, the United Kingdom significantly expanded the reach of its anti-bribery law with the creation of the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (the \u201cUK Bribery Act\u201d). The UK Bribery Act prohibits companies that conduct business in the United Kingdom and their employees and representatives from giving, offering or promising bribes to any person, including non-UK government officials, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting bribes from any person. Under the UK Bribery Act, companies may be held liable for failing to prevent their employees and associated persons from violating the UK Bribery Act. While we\nhave developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure strict compliance by us and our personnel with the FCPA and UK Bribery Act, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or other applicable anti-corruption laws could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties, material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects, financial position or the market value of our common units.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by personnel of portfolio companies, properties or projects in which our funds invest. For example, failures by personnel at our portfolio companies, properties or projects to comply with anti-bribery, trade sanctions, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or Environmental Protection Agency regulations or other legal and regulatory requirements could expose us to litigation or regulatory action and otherwise adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Such misconduct could negatively affect the valuation of a fund\u2019s investments and consequently affect our funds\u2019 performance and negatively impact our businesses.\nOur use of leverage to finance our businesses exposes us to substantial risks.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) and $244.7 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding. We may choose to finance our businesses operations through further borrowings under the Credit Facility or by issuing additional debt. Our existing and future indebtedness exposes us to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage, including those discussed below under \u201c-Risks Related to Our Funds-Dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\u201d The occurrence of any of these risks could cause us to suffer a decline in the credit ratings assigned to our debt by rating agencies, which would cause the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Facility to increase and could result in other material adverse effects on our businesses. We depend on financial institutions extending credit to us on terms that are reasonable to us. There is no guarantee that such institutions will continue to extend credit to us or renew any existing credit agreements we may have with them, or that we will be able to refinance outstanding facilities when they mature. Furthermore, our Credit Facility and the indenture governing our senior notes contain certain covenants with which we need to comply. Non-compliance with any of the covenants without cure or waiver would constitute an event of default, and an event of default resulting from a breach of certain covenants could result, at the option of the lenders, in an acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding. In addition, if we incur additional debt, our credit rating could be adversely impacted.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility will mature in February 2022 (maturity date was extended as of February 24, 2017) and the senior notes mature in October 2024. As these borrowings and other indebtedness mature (or are otherwise repaid prior to their scheduled maturities), we may be required to either refinance them by entering into new facilities or issuing additional debt, which could result in higher borrowing costs, or issuing equity, which would dilute existing unitholders. We could also repay these borrowings by using cash on hand, cash provided by our continuing operations or cash from the sale of our assets, which could reduce distributions to our common unitholders. We may be unable to enter into new facilities or issue debt or equity in the future on attractive terms, or at all. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are LIBOR-based obligations. As a result, an increase in short-term interest rates will increase our interest costs if such borrowings have not been hedged into fixed rates.\nThe risks related to our use of leverage may be exacerbated by our funds\u2019 use of leverage to finance investments. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Funds-Dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of returns on those investments.\u201d\nOperational risks may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth.\nWe face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions. We also face operational risk from transactions and key data not being properly recorded, evaluated or accounted for in our funds. In particular, our Credit Group, and to a lesser extent our Private Equity Group, are highly dependent on our ability to process and evaluate, on a daily basis, transactions across markets and geographies in a time-sensitive, efficient and accurate manner. Consequently, we rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems. New investment products we may introduce could create a significant risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to identify or control the relevant risks in the investment strategies employed by such new investment products.\nIn addition, we operate in a business that is highly dependent on information systems and technology. Our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, particularly our growth internationally, and the cost of maintaining the systems may increase from its current level. Such a failure to accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to the information systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, our headquarters and a substantial portion of our personnel are located in Los Angeles. An earthquake or other disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses, including a disruption involving electronic communications, our internal human resources systems or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, or directly affecting our headquarters, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate our businesses without interruption. Although we have disaster recovery programs in place, these may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.\nFinally, we rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our businesses, including for certain information systems, technology and administration of our funds and compliance matters. Any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties or failures of their information systems and technology could impair the quality of our funds\u2019 operations and could impact our reputation, adversely affect our businesses and limit our ability to grow.\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information and/or damage to our business relationships, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThere has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of the cyber and security threats we face, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally to those that are more advanced and persistent, which may target us because, as an alternative asset management firm, we hold confidential and other price sensitive information about existing and potential investments. As a result, we may face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption with respect to sensitive information resulting from an attack by computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems, as well as data processing systems and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information, which are vulnerable to security breaches and cyber incidents. A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to our information systems for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to our business relationships, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those provided by third-party service providers. We have implemented processes, procedures and internal controls designed to mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions and rely on industry accepted securities measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems; however, these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber-incident, do not guarantee that a cyber-incident will not occur and/or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.\nOur funds\u2019 portfolio companies also rely on similar systems and face similar risks. A disruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on the value of these businesses.\nCybersecurity has become a top priority for regulators in the U.S. and around the world. For example, the Commission has announced that one of the 2017 examination priorities for the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations\u2019 is on investment firms\u2019 cybersecurity procedures and controls. We expect to be required to devote increasing levels of funding and resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to continually monitor and enhance our cybersecurity procedures and controls.\nRisks Related to Our Funds\nThe historical returns attributable to our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our common units.\nThe historical performance of our funds is relevant to us primarily insofar as it is indicative of performance fees we have earned in the past and may earn in the future and our reputation and ability to raise new funds. The historical and potential returns of the funds we advise are not, however, directly linked to returns on our common units. Therefore, holders of our common units should not conclude that positive performance of the funds we advise will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in common units. However, poor performance of the funds we advise would likely cause a decline in our revenues and would therefore likely have a negative effect on our operating results and returns on our common units. An investment in our units is not an investment in any of our funds. Also, there is no assurance that projections in respect of our funds or unrealized valuations will\nbe realized.\nMoreover, the historical returns of our funds should not be considered indicative of the future returns of these or from any future funds we may raise, in part because:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions during previous periods may have been significantly more favorable for generating positive performance than the market conditions we may experience in the future;\n\u2022\nour funds\u2019 rates of returns, which are calculated on the basis of net asset value of the funds\u2019 investments, reflect unrealized gains, which may never be realized;\n\u2022\nour funds\u2019 returns have previously benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not recur, including the availability of debt capital on attractive terms and the availability of distressed debt opportunities, and we may not be able to achieve the same returns or profitable investment opportunities or deploy capital as quickly;\n\u2022\nthe historical returns that we present in this report derive largely from the performance of our earlier funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds or funds not yet formed, which may have little or no realized investment track record;\n\u2022\nour funds\u2019 historical investments were made over a long period of time and over the course of various market and macroeconomic cycles, and the circumstances under which our current or future funds may make future investments may differ significantly from those conditions prevailing in the past;\n\u2022\nthe attractive returns of certain of our funds have been driven by the rapid return of invested capital, which has not occurred with respect to all of our funds and we believe is less likely to occur in the future;\n\u2022\nin recent years, there has been increased competition for private equity investment opportunities resulting from the increased amount of capital invested in alternative funds and high liquidity in debt markets, and the increased competition for investments may reduce our returns in the future; and\n\u2022\nour newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they take to deploy their capital.\nThe future internal rate of return for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical internal rate of return generated by any particular fund, or for our funds as a whole. Future returns will also be affected by the risks described elsewhere in this report, including risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular fund invests.\nValuation methodologies for certain assets can be subject to significant subjectivity, and the values of assets may never be realized.\nMany of the investments in our funds are illiquid and thus have no readily ascertainable market prices. We value these investments based on our estimate, or an independent third party\u2019s estimate, of their fair value as of the date of determination, which often involves significant subjectivity. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith and in many cases fair value is best expressed as a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived. We estimate the fair value of our investments based on third-party models, or models developed by us, which include discounted cash flow analyses and other techniques and may be based, at least in part, on independently sourced market parameters. The material estimates and assumptions used in these models include the timing and expected amount of cash flows, the appropriateness of discount rates used, and, in some cases, the ability to execute, the timing of and the estimated proceeds from expected financings, some or all of which factors may be ascribed more or less weight in light of the particular circumstances. The actual results related to any particular investment often vary materially as a result of the inaccuracy of these estimates and assumptions. In addition, because many of the illiquid investments held by our funds are in industries or sectors which are unstable, in distress or undergoing some uncertainty, such investments are subject to rapid changes in value caused by sudden company-specific or industry-wide developments.\nWe include the fair value of illiquid assets in the calculations of net asset values, returns of our funds and our assets under management. Furthermore, we recognize performance fees from affiliates based in part on these estimated fair values. Because these valuations are inherently uncertain, they may fluctuate greatly from period to period. Also, they may vary greatly from the prices that would be obtained if the assets were to be liquidated on the date of the valuation and often do vary greatly from the prices we eventually realize; as a result, there can be no assurance that such unrealized valuations will be fully or timely realized.\nIn addition, the values of our investments in publicly traded assets are subject to significant volatility, including due to a number of factors beyond our control. These include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of these companies or other companies in their industries, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale, general economic, social or political developments, changes in industry conditions or government regulations, changes in management or capital structure and significant acquisitions and dispositions. Because the market prices of these securities can be volatile, the valuations of these assets change from period to period, and the valuation for any particular period may not be\nrealized at the time of disposition. In addition, because our funds often hold large positions in their portfolio companies, the disposition of these securities often is delayed for, or takes place over, long periods of time, which can further expose us to volatility risk. Even if we hold a quantity of public securities that may be difficult to sell in a single transaction, we do not discount the market price of the security for purposes of our valuations.\nAlthough we frequently engage independent third parties to perform the foregoing valuations, the valuation process remains inherently subjective for the reasons described above.\nIf we realize value on an investment that is significantly lower than the value at which it was reflected in a fund\u2019s net asset values, we would suffer losses in the applicable fund. This could in turn lead to a decline in asset management fees and a loss equal to the portion of the performance fees from affiliates reported in prior periods that was not realized upon disposition. These effects could become applicable to a large number of our investments if our estimates and assumptions used in estimating their fair values differ from future valuations due to market developments. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Segment Analysis\u201d for information related to fund activity that is no longer consolidated. If asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in fund net asset values, fund investors could lose confidence which could, in turn, result in difficulties in raising additional investments.\nMarket values of debt instruments and publicly traded securities that our funds hold as investments may be volatile.\nThe market prices of debt instruments and publicly traded securities held by some of our funds may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control, including actual or anticipated changes in the profitability of the issuers of such securities, general economic, social or political developments, changes in industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecast by securities analysts, inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, financings, refinancings, securities issuances, acquisitions and dispositions. The value of publicly traded securities in which our funds invest may be particularly volatile as a result of these factors. In addition, debt instruments that are held by our funds to maturity or for long terms must be \u201cmarked-to-market\u201d periodically, and their values are therefore vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and the changes in the general state of the credit environment, notwithstanding their underlying performance. Changes in the values of these investments may adversely affect our investment performance and our results of operations.\nOur funds depend on investment cycles, and any change in such cycles could have an adverse effect on our investment prospects.\nCyclicality is important to our businesses. Weak economic environments have often provided attractive investment opportunities and strong relative investment performance. For example, the relative performance of our high yield bond strategy has typically been strongest in difficult times when default rates are highest, and our distressed debt and control investing funds have historically identified investment opportunities during downturns in the economy when credit is not as readily available. Conversely, we tend to realize value from our investments in times of economic expansion, when opportunities to sell investments may be greater. Thus, we depend on the cyclicality of the market to sustain our businesses and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over extended periods. Any prolonged economic expansion or recession could have an adverse impact on certain of our funds and materially affect our ability to deliver attractive investment returns or generate incentive or other income.\nDependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\nSome of our funds and their investments rely on the use of leverage, and our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend on our ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. If our funds or the companies in which our funds invest raise capital in the structured credit, leveraged loan and high yield bond markets, the results of their operations may suffer if such markets experience dislocations, contractions or volatility. Any such events could adversely impact the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to an overall weakening of the U.S. and global economies. In 2015 and again in 2016, interest rates increased and the credit markets tightened, decreasing the availability of leverage and the attractiveness of the terms on which we, our funds and our portfolio companies were able to obtain debt financing. A protracted economic downturn could adversely affect the financial resources of our funds and their investments (in particular those investments that depend on credit from third parties or that otherwise participate in the credit markets) and their ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, outstanding debt when due. Moreover, these events could affect the terms of available debt financing with, for example, higher rates, higher equity requirements and/or more restrictive covenants, particularly in the area of acquisition financings for leveraged buyout and real estate assets transactions.\nThe absence of available sources of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time or an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance\nthose investments. Future increases in interest rates could also make it more difficult to locate and consummate investments because other potential buyers, including operating companies acting as strategic buyers, may be able to bid for an asset at a higher price due to a lower overall cost of capital or their ability to benefit from a higher amount of cost savings following the acquisition of the asset. In addition, a portion of the indebtedness used to finance investments often includes high yield debt securities issued in the capital markets. Availability of capital from the high yield debt markets is subject to significant volatility, and there may be times when we are unable to access those markets at attractive rates, or at all, when completing an investment. Certain investments may also be financed through borrowings on fund-level debt facilities, which may or may not be available for a refinancing at the end of their respective terms. Finally, the interest payments on the indebtedness used to finance our funds\u2019 investments are generally deductible expenses for income tax purposes under current law, subject to limitations under applicable tax law and policy. Any change in such tax law or policy to eliminate or substantially limit these income tax deductions, as has been discussed from time to time in various jurisdictions, would reduce the after-tax rates of return on the affected investments, which may have an adverse impact on our businesses and financial results. See \u201c-Our funds make investments in companies that are based outside of the United States, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the United States.\u201d\nIn the event that our funds are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at an increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms, our funds may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case, either of which could reduce the performance and investment income earned by us. Similarly, our funds\u2019 portfolio companies regularly utilize the corporate debt markets to obtain financing for their operations. If the credit markets continue to render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance of those portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment returns of our funds. In addition, if the markets make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, some of our portfolio companies may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWhen our funds\u2019 existing portfolio investments reach the point when debt incurred to finance those investments matures in significant amounts and must be either repaid or refinanced, those investments may materially suffer if they have not generated sufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt and there is insufficient capacity and availability in the financing markets to permit them to refinance maturing debt on satisfactory terms, or at all. A persistence of the limited availability of financing for such purposes for an extended period of time when significant amounts of the debt incurred to finance our funds\u2019 existing portfolio investments becomes due could have a material adverse effect on these funds.\nOur funds may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs and certain funds, particularly in our Credit Group, regularly borrow a substantial amount of their capital. The use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss in the value of the investment portfolio. A fund may borrow money from time to time to purchase or carry securities or may enter into derivative transactions with counterparties that have embedded leverage. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by appreciation in the securities purchased or carried and will be lost, and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated, in the event of a decline in the market value of such securities. Gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund\u2019s net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. However, if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund\u2019s net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings. In addition, as a business development company registered under the Investment Company Act, ARCC is permitted to incur indebtedness or issue senior securities only in amounts such that its asset coverage ratio equals at least 200% after each such issuance or issuance. ARCC\u2019s ability to pay dividends will be restricted if its asset coverage ratio falls below at least 200% and any amounts that it uses to service its indebtedness are not available for dividends to its common stockholders. An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investments that our funds make. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nSome of our funds may invest in companies that are highly leveraged, which may increase the risk of loss associated with those investments.\nSome of our funds may invest in companies whose capital structures involve significant leverage. For example, in many non-distressed private equity investments, indebtedness may be as much as 75% or more of a portfolio company\u2019s or real estate asset\u2019s total debt and equity capitalization, including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment, whether incurred at or above the investment-level entity. In distressed situations, indebtedness may exceed 100% or more of a portfolio company\u2019s capitalization. Additionally, the debt positions acquired by our funds may be the most junior in what could be a complex capital structure, and thus subject us to the greatest risk of loss.\nInvestments in highly leveraged entities are also inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments. Furthermore, the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:\n\u2022\nsubject the entity to a number of restrictive covenants, terms and conditions, any violation of which could be viewed by creditors as an event of default and could materially impact our ability to realize value from the investment;\n\u2022\nallow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render the entity unable to service its indebtedness, leading to a bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of part or all of our fund\u2019s equity investment in it;\n\u2022\ngive rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow, which might limit the entity\u2019s ability to respond to changing industry conditions if additional cash is needed for the response, to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimit the entity\u2019s ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have relatively less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit the entity\u2019s ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth; and\n\u2022\nlimit the entity\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for capital expenditures, working capital or other general corporate purposes.\nAs a result, the risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less debt. For example, a number of investments consummated by private equity sponsors during 2005, 2006 and 2007 that utilized significant amounts of leverage subsequently experienced severe economic stress and, in certain cases, defaulted on their debt obligations due to a decrease in revenues and cash flow precipitated by the subsequent economic downturn during 2008 and 2009. Similarly, the leveraged nature of the investments of our real estate funds increases the risk that a decline in the fair value of the underlying real estate or tangible assets will result in their abandonment or foreclosure.\nMany of our funds invest in assets that are high risk, illiquid or subject to restrictions on transfer and we may fail to realize any profits from these activities ever or for a considerable period of time.\nMany of our funds invest in securities that are not publicly traded. In many cases, our funds may be prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities for a period of time. Our funds generally cannot sell these securities publicly unless either their sale is registered under applicable securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available. Accordingly, our funds may be forced, under certain conditions, to sell securities at a loss. The ability of many of our funds, particularly our private equity funds, to dispose of these investments is heavily dependent on the public equity markets. For example, the ability to realize any value from an investment may depend upon the ability of the portfolio company in which such investment is held to complete an initial public offering. Even if the securities are publicly traded, large holdings of securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial period of time. Moreover, because the investment strategy of many of our funds, particularly our Private Equity Group funds, often entails our having representation on our funds\u2019 public portfolio company boards, our funds can effect such sales only during limited trading windows, exposing the investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the intended disposition period. In addition, our Credit Group funds may hold investments in portfolio companies of such Private Equity Group funds on which we have board representation and be restricted for extended periods of time from selling their investments. As such, we may fail to realize any profits from our investments in the funds that hold these securities for a considerable period of time or at all, and we may lose some or all of the principal amount of our investments.\nCertain of our funds utilize special situation and distressed debt investment strategies that involve significant risks.\nCertain of the funds in our Credit and Private Equity Groups invest in obligors and issuers with weak financial conditions, poor operating results, substantial financing needs, negative net worth and/or special competitive problems. These funds also invest in obligors and issuers that are involved in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings. In such situations, it may be difficult to obtain full information as to the exact financial and operating conditions of these obligors and issuers. Additionally, the fair values of such investments are subject to abrupt and erratic market movements and significant price volatility if they are publicly traded securities, and are subject to significant uncertainty in general if they are not publicly traded securities. Furthermore, some of our funds\u2019 distressed investments may not be widely traded or may have no recognized market. A fund\u2019s exposure to such investments may be substantial in relation to the market for those investments, and the assets are likely to be illiquid and difficult to sell or transfer. As a result, it may take a number of years for the market value of such investments to ultimately reflect their intrinsic value as perceived by us.\nA central feature of our distressed investment strategy is our ability to effectively anticipate the occurrence of certain corporate events, such as debt and/or equity offerings, restructurings, reorganizations, mergers, takeover offers and other transactions, that we believe will improve the condition of the business. Similarly, we perform significant analysis of the company\u2019s capital structure, operations, industry and ability to generate income, as well as market valuation of the company and its debt, and develop a strategy with respect to a particular distressed investment based on such analysis. In furtherance of that strategy our funds seek to identify the best position in the capital structure in which to invest. If the relevant corporate event that we anticipate is delayed, changed or never completed, or if our analysis or investment strategy is inaccurate, the market price and value of the applicable fund\u2019s investment could decline sharply.\nIn addition, these investments could subject a fund to certain potential additional liabilities that may exceed the value of its original investment. Under certain circumstances, payments or distributions on certain investments may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance, a preferential payment or similar transaction under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws. In addition, under certain circumstances, a lender that has inappropriately exercised control of the management and policies of a debtor may have its claims subordinated or disallowed, or may be found liable for damages suffered by parties as a result of such actions. In the case where the investment in securities of troubled companies is made in connection with an attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in bankruptcy, our funds may become involved in substantial litigation.\nOur funds may be unable to deploy capital at a steady and consistent pace, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and future fundraising.\nThe pace and consistency of our funds\u2019 capital deployment has been, and may in the future continue to be, affected by a range of factors, primarily market conditions and regulatory developments, that are beyond our control. For example, in 2016 our corporate Private Equity Group funds deployed less capital than in prior years as they exercised patience amid elevated purchase price multiples. During the same period, our AUM not yet earning fees, which we refer to as our \u201cshadow\u201d AUM, increased due to ongoing fundraising. While this \u201cshadow\u201d AUM represents significant future fee-earning potential, our inability to deploy this capital on the timeframe we expect, or at all, and on terms that we believe are attractive, would reduce or delay the management and performance fees that we would otherwise expect to earn on this capital. Any such reduction or delay would impair our ability to offset investments in additional resources that we often make to manage new capital, including hiring additional professionals. Moreover, we could be delayed in raising successor funds. The impact of any such reduction or delay would be particularly adverse with respect to funds where management fees are paid on invested capital. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and growth.\nCertain of the funds or accounts we advise or manage are subject to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, and our businesses could be adversely affected if certain of our other funds or accounts fail to satisfy an exception under the \u201cplan assets\u201d regulation under ERISA.\nCertain of the funds and accounts we advise or manage are subject to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. For example, we currently manage some of our funds or accounts as \u201cplan assets\u201d under ERISA. With respect to these funds or accounts, this results in the application of the fiduciary responsibility standards of ERISA to investments made by such funds or accounts, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification, and the possibility that certain transactions that we enter into, or may have entered into, on behalf of these funds or accounts, in the normal course of business, might constitute or result in, or have constituted or resulted in, non-exempt prohibited transactions under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. A non-exempt prohibited transaction, in addition to imposing potential liability upon fiduciaries of an ERISA plan, may also result in the imposition of an excise tax under the Code upon a \u201cparty in interest\u201d (as defined in ERISA) or \u201cdisqualified person\u201d (as defined in the Code) with whom we engaged in the transaction. Some of our other funds or accounts currently qualify as venture capital operating companies (\u201cVCOCs\u201d) or rely on another exception under the \u201cplan assets\u201d regulation under ERISA and therefore are not subject to the fiduciary requirements of ERISA with respect to their assets. However, if these funds or accounts fail to satisfy the VCOC requirements for any reason, including as a result of an amendment of the relevant regulations by the U.S. Department of Labor, or another exception under the \u201cplan assets\u201d regulation under ERISA, such failure could materially interfere with our activities in relation to these funds or accounts or expose us to risks related to our failure to comply with the applicable requirements.\nOur funds may be liable for the underfunded pension liabilities of their portfolio companies.\nUnder ERISA, members of certain \u201ccontrolled groups\u201d of \u201ctrades or businesses\u201d may be jointly and severally liable for contributions required under any member\u2019s tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan and under certain other benefit plans. Similarly, if any member\u2019s tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan were to terminate, underfunding at termination would be the joint and several responsibility of all controlled group members, including members whose employees did not participate in\nthe terminated plan. Similarly, joint and several liability may be imposed for certain pension plan related obligations in connection with the complete or partial withdrawal by an employer from a multiemployer pension plan. Depending on a number of factors, including the level of ownership held by our funds in a particular portfolio company, a fund may be considered to be a member of a portfolio company\u2019s \u201ccontrolled group\u201d for this purpose, and thus may be liable for the underfunded pension liabilities of such portfolio company.\nIn Sun Capital Partners III L.P. v. New England Teamster and Trucking Industry Pension Fund, the First Circuit Court of Appeal held that a fund was engaged in a \u201ctrade or business\u201d with a portfolio company for purposes of the ERISA rules and was thus liable for underfunded pension liabilities. If this decision is applied generally to private equity investing, our funds could be exposed to liability for certain benefit plan contributions, a liability that could be significant if the portfolio company\u2019s pension plan is significantly underfunded.\nOur funds\u2019 performance, and our performance, may be adversely affected by the financial performance of our portfolio companies and the industries in which our funds invest.\nOur performance and the performance of our funds are significantly impacted by the value of the companies in which our funds have invested. Our funds invest in companies in many different industries, each of which is subject to volatility based upon economic and market factors. The credit crisis between mid-2007 and the end of 2009 caused significant fluctuations in the value of securities held by our funds and the recent global economic recession had a significant impact in overall performance activity and the demands for many of the goods and services provided by portfolio companies of the funds we advise. Although the U.S. economy has registered seven consecutive years of growth in real GDP, there remain many obstacles to continued growth in the economy such as global geopolitical events, risks of inflation or deflation and high debt levels, both public and private. These factors and other general economic trends are likely to affect the performance of portfolio companies in many industries and, in particular, industries that anticipated that the GDP in developed economies would quickly return to pre-crisis trend. The performance of our funds, and our performance, may be adversely affected if our fund portfolio companies in these industries experience adverse performance or additional pressure due to downward trends.\nThe performance of our investments with underlying exposure to the commodities markets is also subject to a high degree of business and market risk, as it is dependent upon prevailing prices of commodities such as oil, natural gas and coal. Prices for oil and natural gas, for example, are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as level of consumer product demand, the refining capacity of oil purchasers, weather conditions, government regulations, the price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions, foreign supply of such commodities and overall economic conditions. It is common in making investments with underlying exposure to the commodities markets to deploy hedging strategies to protect against pricing fluctuations but such strategies may or may not protect our investments. Declining global commodity prices have impacted the value of securities held by our funds. Continued volatility could result in lower returns than we anticipated at the time certain of our investments were made.\nIn respect of real estate, even though the U.S. residential real estate market has recently shown signs of stabilizing from a lengthy and deep downturn, various factors could halt or limit a recovery in the housing market and have an adverse effect on investment performance, including, but not limited to, rising mortgage interest rates, a low level of confidence in the economic recovery or the residential real estate market and high unemployment.\nThird-party investors in certain of our funds with commitment-based structures may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested by us, which could adversely affect a fund\u2019s operations and performance.\nInvestors in certain of our funds make capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. We depend on investors fulfilling and honoring their commitments when we call capital from them for those funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their obligations when due. Any investor that did not fund a capital call would be subject to several possible penalties, including having a meaningful amount of its existing investment forfeited in that fund. However, the impact of the penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an investor has invested little or no capital, for instance early in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful. Investors may also negotiate for lesser or reduced penalties at the outset of the fund, thereby limiting our ability to enforce the funding of a capital call. Third-party investors in private equity and real estate funds typically use distributions from prior investments to meet future capital calls. In cases where valuations of existing investments fall and the pace of distributions slows, investors may be unable to make new commitments to third-party managed investment funds such as those advised by us. A failure of investors to honor a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds could have a material adverse effect on the operation and performance of those funds.\nOur funds make investments in companies that are based outside of the United States, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the United States.\nSome of our funds invest a portion of their assets in the equity, debt, loans or other securities of issuers located outside the United States, including Europe and Asia, while certain of our funds invest substantially all of their assets in these types of securities, and we expect that international investments will increase as a proportion of certain of our funds\u2019 portfolios in the future. Investments in non-U.S. securities involve certain factors not typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, including risks relating to:\n\u2022\nour funds\u2019 abilities to exchange local currencies for U.S. dollars and other currency exchange matters, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and costs associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency into another;\n\u2022\ncontrols on, and changes in controls on, foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of invested capital;\n\u2022\nless developed or less efficient financial markets than exist in the United States, which may lead to price volatility and relative illiquidity;\n\u2022\nthe absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and disclosure requirements and less government supervision and regulation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or clarifications to existing laws that could impact our tax treaty positions, which could adversely impact the returns on our investments;\n\u2022\ndifferences in legal and regulatory environments, particularly with respect to bankruptcy and reorganization, labor and employment laws, less developed corporate laws regarding fiduciary duties and the protection of investors and less reliable judicial systems to enforce contracts and applicable law;\n\u2022\npolitical hostility to investments by foreign or private equity investors;\n\u2022\nless publicly available information in respect of companies in non-U.S. markets;\n\u2022\nreliance on a more limited number of commodity inputs, service providers and/or distribution mechanisms;\n\u2022\nhigher rates of inflation;\n\u2022\nhigher transaction costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in enforcing contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nfewer investor protections;\n\u2022\ncertain economic and political risks, including potential exchange control regulations and restrictions on our non-U.S. investments and repatriation of capital, potential political, economic or social instability, the possibility of nationalization or expropriation or confiscatory taxation and adverse economic and political developments; and\n\u2022\nthe imposition of non-U.S. taxes or withholding taxes on income and gains recognized with respect to such securities.\nWhile our funds will take these factors into consideration in making investment decisions, including when hedging positions, there can be no assurance that adverse developments with respect to these risks will not adversely affect our funds that invest in securities of non-U.S. issuers. In addition, certain of these funds are managed outside the United States, which may increase the foregoing risks.\nMany of our funds make investments in companies that we do not control.\nInvestments by many of our funds will include debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control. Such instruments and securities may be acquired by our funds through trading activities or through purchases of securities from the issuer. In addition, our funds may seek to acquire minority equity interests more frequently and may also dispose of a portion of their majority equity investments in portfolio companies over time in a manner that results in the funds retaining a minority investment. Furthermore, while certain of our funds may make \u201ctoe-hold\u201d distressed debt investments in a company with the intention of obtaining control, there is no assurance that a control position may be obtained and such fund may retain a minority investment. Those investments will be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. If any of the foregoing were to occur, the values of the investments held by our funds could decrease and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could suffer as a result.\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty with regard to expense allocation may increase risk of harm.\nWhile we historically have and will continue to allocate the expenses of our funds in good faith and in accordance with the terms of the relevant fund agreements and our expense allocation policy in effect from time to time, due to increased regulatory scrutiny of expense allocation policies in the private investment funds realm, there is no guarantee that our policies and practices\nwill not be challenged by our supervising regulatory bodies. If our supervising regulators were to determine that we have improperly allocated such expenses, we could be required to refund amounts to the funds and could be subject to regulatory censure, litigation from our fund investors and/or reputational harm, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may need to pay \"clawback or contingent repayment\" obligations if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with our funds.\nGenerally, if at the termination of a fund (and increasingly at interim points in the life of a fund), the fund has not achieved investment returns that (in most cases) exceed the preferred return threshold or (in all cases) the general partner receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement, we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the extent to which carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. This obligation is known as a \u201cclawback\" or contingent repayment obligation. Due in part to our investment performance and the fact that our carried interest is generally determined on a liquidation basis, as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, if the funds were liquidated at their fair values at that date, there would have been no contingent repayment obligation or liability. There can be no assurance that we will not incur a contingent repayment obligation in the future. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, had we assumed all existing investments were worthless, the amount of carried interest, net of tax, subject to contingent repayment would have been approximately $418.3 million, $322.2 million and $295.7 million, respectively, of which approximately $323.9 million, $247.9 million and $239.3 million, respectively, is reimbursable to the Company by certain professionals. Although a contingent repayment obligation is several to each person who received a distribution, and not a joint obligation, if a recipient does not fund his or her respective share of a contingent repayment obligation, we may have to fund such additional amounts beyond the amount of carried interest we retained, although we generally will retain the right to pursue remedies against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations. We may need to use or reserve cash to repay such contingent repayment obligations instead of using the cash for other purposes. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contingent Obligations,\u201d Note 2 \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 13 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from funds managed pursuant to management agreements that may be terminated or fund partnership agreements that permit fund investors to request liquidation of investments in our funds on short notice.\nThe terms of our funds generally give either the manager of the fund or the fund itself the right to terminate our investment management agreement with the fund. However, insofar as we control the general partners of our funds that are limited partnerships, the risk of termination of investment management agreement for such funds is limited, subject to our fiduciary or contractual duties as general partner. This risk is more significant for certain of our funds that have independent boards of directors.\nWith respect to our funds that are subject to the Investment Company Act, each fund\u2019s investment management agreement must be approved annually by (a) such fund\u2019s board of directors or by the vote of a majority of such fund\u2019s stockholders and (b) the majority of the independent members of such fund\u2019s board of directors and, in certain cases, by its stockholders, as required by law. The funds\u2019 investment management agreements can also be terminated by the majority of such fund\u2019s stockholders. Termination of these agreements would reduce the fees we earn from the relevant funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Currently, ARDC, a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act, and ARCC, a registered investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act, are subject to these provisions of the Investment Company Act.\nThird-party investors in many our funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund and to terminate the investment period under certain circumstances. In addition, the investment management agreements related to our separately managed accounts may permit the investor to terminate our management of such accounts on short notice. These events would lead to a decrease in our revenues, which could be substantial.\nThe governing agreements of many of our funds provide that, subject to certain conditions, third-party investors in those funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund or terminate the fund, including in certain cases without cause by a simple majority vote. Any such removal or dissolution could result in a cessation in management fees we would earn from such funds and/or a significant reduction in the expected amounts of performance fees or carried interest from those funds. Performance fees or carried interest could be significantly reduced as a result of our inability to maximize the value of investments by a fund during the liquidation process or in the event of the triggering of a \u201ccontingent repayment\" obligation. Finally, the applicable funds would cease to exist after completion of liquidation and winding-up.\nIn addition, the governing agreements of many of our funds provide that, subject to certain conditions, third-party investors in those funds have the right to terminate the investment period of the fund, including in certain cases without cause. Such an\nevent could have a significant negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow of such fund. The governing agreements of our funds may also provide that upon the occurrence of events, including in the event that certain \u201ckey persons\u201d in our funds do not meet specified time commitments with regard to managing the fund, investors in those funds have the right to vote to terminate the investment period, including in certain cases by a simple majority vote in accordance with specified procedures. In addition to having a significant negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow, the occurrence of such an event with respect to any of our funds would likely result in significant reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our future fundraising efforts.\nWe currently manage a portion of investor assets through separately managed accounts whereby we earn management fees and performance fees or carried interest, and we intend to continue to seek additional separately managed account mandates. The investment management agreements we enter into in connection with managing separately managed accounts on behalf of certain clients may in certain cases be terminated by such clients on as little as 30 days\u2019 prior written notice. In addition, the boards of directors of the investment management companies we manage could terminate our advisory engagement of those companies on as little as 30 days\u2019 prior written notice. ARCC\u2019s investment management agreement can be terminated by the majority of its stockholders upon 60 days\u2019 prior written notice. In the case of any such terminations, the management fees and performance fees or carried interest we earn in connection with managing such account or company would immediately cease, which could result in a significant adverse impact on our revenues.\nIn addition, if we were to experience a change of control (as defined under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or as otherwise set forth in the partnership agreements of our funds), continuation of the investment management agreements of our funds would be subject to investor consent. There can be no assurance that required consents will be obtained if a change of control occurs. In addition, with respect to our funds that are subject to the Investment Company Act, each fund\u2019s investment management agreement must be approved annually (a) by such fund\u2019s board of directors or by a vote of the majority of such fund\u2019s stockholders and (b) by the independent members of such fund\u2019s board of directors and, in certain cases, by its stockholders, as required by law. Termination of these agreements would cause us to lose the management fees and performance fees we earn from such funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA downturn in the global credit markets could adversely affect our CLO investments.\nAmong the sectors that have been particularly challenged by a downturn in the global credit markets are the CLO and leveraged finance markets. CLOs are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. In 2008 and through early 2009, liquidity in the credit markets was significantly reduced, resulting in an increase in credit spreads and a decline in ratings, performance and market values for leveraged loans. We have significant exposure to these markets through our investments in our CLO funds. CLOs invest on a leveraged basis in loans or securities that are themselves highly leveraged investments in the underlying collateral, which increases both the opportunity for higher returns as well as the magnitude of losses when compared to unlevered investments. As a result of such funds\u2019 leveraged position, CLOs and their investors are at greater risk of suffering losses. The CLO market in which we invest has experienced an increase in downgrades, defaults and declines in market value and defaults in respect of leveraged loans in their collateral. Many CLOs have failed in the past or may in the future fail one or more of their \u201covercollateralization\u201d tests. The failure of one or more of these tests will result in reduced cash flows that may have been otherwise available for distribution to us. This would reduce the value of our investment. There can be no assurance that market conditions giving rise to these types of consequences will not once again occur, subsist or become more acute in the future.\nOur funds may face risks relating to undiversified investments.\nWhile diversification is generally an objective of our funds, there can be no assurance as to the degree of diversification, if any, that will be achieved in any fund investments. Difficult market conditions or slowdowns affecting a particular asset class, geographic region or other category of investment could have a significant adverse impact on a fund if its investments are concentrated in that area, which would result in lower investment returns. This lack of diversification may expose a fund to losses disproportionate to market declines in general if there are disproportionately greater adverse price movements in the particular investments. If a fund holds investments concentrated in a particular issuer, security, asset class or geographic region, such fund may be more susceptible than a more widely diversified investment partnership to the negative consequences of a single corporate, economic, political or regulatory event. Accordingly, a lack of diversification on the part of a fund could adversely affect a fund\u2019s performance and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe performance of our investments may fall short of our expectations and the expectations of the investors in our funds.\nBefore making investments, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. The due diligence investigation that we will carry\nout with respect to an investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity.\nOnce we have made an investment in a portfolio company, our funds generally establish the capital structure on the basis of financial projections prepared by the management of such portfolio company. These projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed. General economic conditions, which are not predictable, along with other factors, may cause actual performance to fall short of the projections.\nAdditionally, we may cause our funds to acquire an investment that is subject to contingent liabilities. Such contingent liabilities could be unknown to us at the time of acquisition or, if they are known to us, we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks that they present. Acquired contingent liabilities could thus result in unforeseen losses for our funds. In addition, in connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company, a fund may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of such portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. A fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment if any such representations are inaccurate. These arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities by a fund, even after the disposition of an investment. Accordingly, the inaccuracy of representations and warranties made by a fund could harm such fund\u2019s performance.\nOur funds may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time.\nOur funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved, either by expiration of such fund\u2019s term or otherwise. Although we generally expect that investments will be disposed of prior to dissolution or be suitable for in-kind distribution at dissolution, and the general partners of the funds have only a limited ability to extend the term of the fund with the consent of fund investors or the advisory board of the fund, as applicable, our funds may have to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time as a result of dissolution. This would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself.\nOur real estate funds are subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and the construction and development of real estate.\nInvestments in our real estate funds will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and real estate-related businesses and assets. These risks include the following:\n\u2022\nthose associated with the burdens of ownership of real property;\n\u2022\ngeneral and local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in supply of and demand for competing properties in an area (as a result, for example, of overbuilding);\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the average occupancy and room rates for hotel properties;\n\u2022\nthe financial resources of tenants;\n\u2022\nchanges in building, environmental and other laws;\n\u2022\nenergy and supply shortages;\n\u2022\nvarious uninsured or uninsurable risks;\n\u2022\nliability for \u201cslip-and-fall\u201d and other accidents on properties held by our funds;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations (such as rent control and tax laws);\n\u2022\nchanges in real property tax and transfer tax rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe reduced availability of mortgage funds which may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable;\n\u2022\nnegative developments in the economy that depress travel activity;\n\u2022\nenvironmental liabilities;\n\u2022\ncontingent liabilities on disposition of assets;\n\u2022\nunexpected cost overruns in connection with development projects;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks, war and other factors that are beyond our control; and\n\u2022\ndependence on local operating partners.\nAlthough real estate values have generally rebounded with the rest of the economy, other than certain high profile assets in the best markets, various factors could halt or limit a recovery in the housing market.\nIf our real estate funds acquire direct or indirect interests in undeveloped land or underdeveloped real property, which may often be non-income producing, they will be subject to the risks normally associated with such assets and development\nactivities, including risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory or environmental approvals, the cost and timely completion of construction (including risks beyond the control of our fund, such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages) and the availability of both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms. Additionally, our funds\u2019 properties may be managed by a third party, which makes us dependent upon such third parties and subjects us to risks associated with the actions of such third parties. Any of these factors may cause the value of the investments in our real estate funds to decline, which may have a material impact on our results of operations.\nCertain of our funds invest in the energy sector which is subject to significant market volatility. As such, the performance of investments in the energy sector is subject to a high degree of business and market risk.\nThe energy companies in which certain of our funds invest have been and will be negatively impacted by material declines in energy related commodity prices and are subject to other risks, including among others, supply and demand risk, operational risk, regulatory risk, depletion risk, reserve risk and catastrophic event risk. Commodity prices fluctuate for several reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions, the impact of weather on demand, levels of domestic production and international production, policies implemented by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, energy conservation, domestic and foreign governmental regulation and taxation and the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems.\nHedging strategies may adversely affect the returns on our funds\u2019 investments.\nWhen managing our exposure to market risks, we may (on our own behalf or on behalf of our funds) from time to time use forward contracts, options, swaps, caps, collars, floors, foreign currency forward contracts, currency swap agreements, currency option contracts or other strategies. Currency fluctuations in particular can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and financial condition. The success of any hedging or other derivative transactions generally will depend on our ability to correctly predict market or foreign exchange changes, the degree of correlation between price movements of a derivative instrument and the position being hedged, the creditworthiness of the counterparty and other factors. As a result, while we may enter into a transaction to reduce our exposure to market or foreign exchange risks, the transaction may result in poorer overall investment performance than if it had not been executed. Such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a hedged position increases.\nWhile such hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail certain other risks. These arrangements may require the posting of cash collateral at a time when a fund has insufficient cash or illiquid assets such that the posting of the cash is either impossible or requires the sale of assets at prices that do not reflect their underlying value. Moreover, these hedging arrangements may generate significant transaction costs, including potential tax costs, that reduce the returns generated by a fund. Finally, the CFTC has made several public statements that it may soon issue a proposal for certain foreign exchange products to be subject to mandatory clearing, which could increase the cost of entering into currency hedges.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nIf we were deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nAn entity will generally be deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d for purposes of the Investment Company Act if:\n\u2022\nit is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; or\n\u2022\nabsent an applicable exemption, it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\nWe believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of providing investment management services and not primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We hold ourselves out as an asset management firm and do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are an \u201corthodox\u201d investment company as defined in Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act and described in the first bullet point above. Furthermore, we have no material assets other than interests in certain direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act), which in turn have no material assets other than partnership units in the Ares Operating Group entities. These wholly owned subsidiaries are the general partners of certain of the Ares Operating Group entities and are vested with all management and control over such Ares Operating Group entities. We do not believe that the equity interests of Ares Management, L.P. in its wholly owned subsidiaries or the partnership units of these wholly owned subsidiaries in the Ares Operating Group entities are investment securities. Moreover, because we believe that the capital interests\nof the general partners of our funds in their respective funds are neither securities nor investment securities, we believe that less than 40% of Ares Management, L.P.\u2019s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis are composed of assets that could be considered investment securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that Ares Management, L.P. is an inadvertent investment company by virtue of the 40% test in Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act as described in the second bullet point above.\nThe Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operation of investment companies. Among other things, the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, generally prohibit the issuance of options and impose certain governance requirements. We intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If anything were to happen that would cause us to be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, requirements imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on capital structure, the ability to transact business with affiliates and the ability to compensate senior employees, could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses as currently conducted, impair the agreements and arrangements between and among the Ares Operating Group, us, our funds and our senior management, or any combination thereof, and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to limit the amount of investments that we make as a principal or otherwise conduct our businesses in a manner that does not subject us to the registration and other requirements of the Investment Company Act.\nOur common unitholders do not elect our general partner or, except in limited circumstances, vote on our general partner\u2019s directors and have limited ability to influence decisions regarding our businesses.\nOur general partner manages all of our operations and activities. On January 31 of each year, our general partner will determine whether the total voting power held collectively by (i) holders of the special voting units in Ares Management, L.P. (including our general partner, members of Ares Partners Holdco LLC and their respective affiliates), (ii) then-current or former Ares personnel (including indirectly through related entities) and (iii) Ares Owners Holdings L.P. is at least 10% of the voting power of the outstanding voting units of Ares Management, L.P. (the \u201cAres control condition\u201d). For purposes of determining whether the Ares control condition is satisfied, our general partner will treat as outstanding, and as held by the foregoing persons, all voting units deliverable to such persons pursuant to equity awards granted to such persons. If the Ares control condition is satisfied, the board of directors of our general partner has no authority other than that which its member chooses to delegate to it. If the Ares control condition is not satisfied, the board of directors of our general partner will be responsible for the oversight of our business and operations. See \u201cItem 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Limited Powers of Our Board of Directors.\u201d\nUnlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our common unitholders have limited voting rights and have no right to remove our general partner or, except in the limited circumstances described below, elect the directors of our general partner. Our common unitholders have no right to elect the directors of our general partner unless the Ares control condition is not satisfied. For so long as the Ares control condition is satisfied, our general partner\u2019s board of directors will be elected in accordance with its limited liability company agreement, which provides that directors may be appointed and removed by Ares Partners Holdco LLC, the member of our general partner. Ares Partners Holdco LLC is owned by the Holdco Members and managed by a board of managers, which is composed of Messrs. Arougheti, de Veer, Kaplan, Ressler and Rosenthal (the \u201cManagers\u201d). Decisions by the board of managers generally are made by a majority of the Managers, which majority, subject to a minimum ownership requirement, must include Antony P. Ressler. As a result, our common unitholders have limited ability to influence decisions regarding our businesses.\nThe Holdco Members will be able to determine the outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of our common unitholders.\nAres Voting LLC, an entity wholly owned by Ares Partners Holdco LLC, which is in turn owned and controlled by the Holdco Members, holds a special voting unit that provides it with a number of votes, on any matter that may be submitted for a vote of our common unitholders (voting together as a single class on all such matters), that is equal to the aggregate number of Ares Operating Group Units held by the limited partners of the Ares Operating Group entities that do not hold a special voting unit. The Holdco Members, through Ares Owners Holdings L.P. and the special voting unit held by Ares Voting LLC, hold approximately 72.13% of the voting power of Ares Management, L.P. Accordingly, the Holdco Members have sufficient voting power to determine the outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of our common unitholders.\nOur common unitholders\u2019 voting rights are further restricted by the provision in our partnership agreement that states that any common units held by a person that beneficially owns 20% or more of any class of our common units then outstanding (other than our general partner, Ares Owners Holdings L.P., a member of Ares Partners Holdco LLC or their respective affiliates,\na direct or subsequently approved transferee of our general partner or its affiliates or a person who acquired such common units with the prior approval of our general partner) cannot be voted on any matter. In addition, our partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of our common unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the ability of our common unitholders to influence the manner or direction of our management. Our partnership agreement also does not restrict our general partner\u2019s ability to take actions that may result in our being treated as an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable state) income tax purposes. Furthermore, the common unitholders are not be entitled to dissenters\u2019 rights of appraisal under our partnership agreement or applicable Delaware law in the event of a merger or consolidation, a sale of substantially all of our assets or any other transaction or event.\nAs a result of these matters and the provisions referred to under \u201c-Our common unitholders do not elect our general partner or, except in limited circumstances, vote on our general partner\u2019s directors and have limited ability to influence decisions regarding our businesses,\u201d our common unitholders may be deprived of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common units in the future through a sale of Ares Management, L.P., and the trading prices of our common units may be adversely affected by the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.\nPotential conflicts of interest may arise among our general partner, its affiliates or associates and us. Our general partner and its affiliates and associates have limited fiduciary duties to us and our preferred and common unitholders, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our preferred and common unitholders.\nConflicts of interest may arise among our general partner or its affiliates or associates, on the one hand, and us or our preferred and common unitholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner, which is wholly owned by Ares Partners Holdco LLC, which is in turn owned and controlled by Holdco Members, may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates or associates (including the Holdco Members) over our interests or the interests of our preferred and common unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nour general partner determines the amount and timing of our investments and dispositions, indebtedness, issuances of additional partnership interests and amounts of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to our common unitholders;\n\u2022\nour general partner, in resolving conflicts of interest, is entitled to take into account only such factors as it determines in its sole discretion to be relevant, reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances, which may include factors affecting parties other than us and our preferred and common unitholders (including the Holdco Members), which has the effect of limiting its duties (including fiduciary duties) to us and our preferred and common unitholders. For example, our subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of our funds have fiduciary and contractual obligations to the investors in those funds, as a result of which we expect to regularly take actions in a manner consistent with such duties and obligations but that might adversely affect our results of operations or cash flow;\n\u2022\nbecause our senior professional owners hold their Ares Operating Group Units through an entity that is not subject to corporate income taxation and Ares Management, L.P. holds Ares Operating Group Units directly or through direct subsidiaries, some of which are subject to corporate income taxation, conflicts may arise between our senior professional owners and Ares Management, L.P. relating to the selection, structuring and disposition of investments and other matters;\n\u2022\nother than as set forth in the fair competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality agreements to which the Holdco Members are subject, which may not be enforceable, affiliates of our general partner and existing and former personnel employed by our general partner are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us;\n\u2022\nour general partner and its affiliates and associates have limited their liability and reduced or eliminated their duties (including fiduciary duties) under our partnership agreement, while also restricting the remedies available to our preferred and common unitholders for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of duty (including fiduciary duty). In addition, we have agreed to indemnify our general partner and its affiliates and associates (including the Holdco Members) to the fullest extent permitted by law, except with respect to conduct involving bad faith or criminal intent. By purchasing our preferred and common units, holders of our preferred and common units have agreed and consented to the provisions set forth in our partnership agreement, including the provisions regarding conflicts of interest situations that, in the absence of such provisions, might constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law;\n\u2022\nour partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered, or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf, so long as the terms of any such additional contractual arrangements are agreed to by our general partner in good faith as determined under our partnership agreement;\n\u2022\nour general partner determines how much we pay for acquisition targets and the structure of such consideration,\nincluding whether to incur debt to fund the transaction, whether to issue units as consideration and the number of units to be issued and the amount and timing of any earn-out payments;\n\u2022\nthe sole member of our general partner determines whether to allow senior professionals to exchange their units or waive certain restrictions relating to such units;\n\u2022\nour general partner determines how much debt we incur and that decision may adversely affect our credit ratings;\n\u2022\nour general partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us;\n\u2022\nour general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates; and\n\u2022\nour general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.\nSee \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) of our general partner and its affiliates and associates and limit remedies available to preferred and common unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of duty. It is difficult for a preferred and common unitholder to successfully challenge a resolution of a conflict of interest by our general partner or by its conflicts committee.\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that waive or consent to conduct by our general partner or its affiliates or associates that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with fiduciary duties or applicable law. For example, our partnership agreement provides that when our general partner is acting in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner, it or any of its affiliates or associates causing it to do so may act without any duties (including fiduciary duties) or obligations to us or our preferred and common unitholders whatsoever. When our general partner, in its capacity as our general partner, is permitted to or required to make a decision in its \u201csole discretion\u201d or \u201cdiscretion\u201d or under a grant of similar authority or latitude or pursuant to any provision not subject to an express standard of \u201cgood faith,\u201d then our general partner is entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests or the interests of the Holdco Members, and has no duty or obligation (fiduciary or otherwise) to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting us or any preferred and common unitholders and is not subject to any different standards imposed by our partnership agreement, or otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise. These provisions are expressly permitted by Delaware law. Unless our general partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our partnership agreement, we and our preferred and common unitholders do not have any recourse against our general partner even if our general partner were to act in a manner that was inconsistent with traditional fiduciary duties. Furthermore, even if there has been a breach of our partnership agreement, our partnership agreement provides that our general partner and its members, managers, officers and directors will not be liable to us or our preferred and common unitholders for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or its members, managers, officers or directors acted in bad faith or with criminal intent. These modifications are detrimental to the preferred and common unitholders because they restrict the remedies available to preferred and common unitholders for actions that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty (including fiduciary duty).\nWhenever a potential conflict of interest exists between us, any of our subsidiaries or any of our partners and our general partner or its affiliates or associates, our general partner may resolve such conflict of interest in good faith. If our general partner subjectively believes that its resolution of the conflict of interest is not opposed to our best interests, then it will be conclusively deemed that its resolution was made in good faith and will not be a breach of our partnership agreement or any duty. A preferred or common unitholder seeking to challenge this resolution of the conflict of interest would bear the burden of overcoming such presumption. This is different from the situation with Delaware corporations, where a conflict resolution by an interested party would be presumed to be unfair and the interested party would have the burden of demonstrating that the resolution was fair.\nAlso, if our general partner obtains the approval of its conflicts committee or a majority of the voting units, the resolution will be conclusively deemed approved by us and our preferred and common unitholders and not a breach of our partnership agreement (or any agreement referred to therein) or of any duties that our general partner or its affiliates or associates may owe to us or our preferred and common unitholders. This is different from the situation with Delaware corporations, where a conflict resolution by a committee consisting solely of independent directors may, in certain circumstances, merely shift the burden of demonstrating unfairness to the plaintiff. Preferred and common unitholders are treated as having consented to the provisions set forth in our partnership agreement, including provisions regarding conflicts of interest situations that, in the absence of such provisions, might be considered a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law. As a result, preferred and common unitholders will, as a practical matter, not be able to successfully challenge an informed decision by the conflicts committee. See \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nThe potential requirement to convert our financial statements from being prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to International Financial Reporting Standards may strain our resources and increase our annual expenses.\nAs a public entity, the SEC may require in the future that we report our financial results under International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) instead of under GAAP. IFRS is a set of accounting principles that has been gaining acceptance on a worldwide basis. These standards are published by the London-based International Accounting Standards Board and are more focused on objectives and principles and less reliant on detailed rules than GAAP. Today, there remain significant and material differences in several key areas between GAAP and IFRS which would affect us. Additionally, GAAP provides specific guidance in classes of accounting transactions for which equivalent guidance in IFRS does not exist. The adoption of IFRS is highly complex and would have an impact on many aspects of us and our operations, including but not limited to financial accounting and reporting systems, internal controls, taxes, borrowing covenants and cash management. It is expected that a significant amount of time, internal and external resources and expenses over a multi-year period would be required for this conversion.\nThe requirements of being a public entity and sustaining growth may strain our resources.\nAs a public entity, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and requires our management and independent auditors to report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, significant resources and management oversight is required. We have implemented procedures and processes to address the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. If we are not able to maintain the necessary procedures and processes, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely or accurate basis, which could subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the Commission or violations of applicable NYSE listing rules, and result in a breach of the covenants under the agreements governing any of our financing arrangements. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements could also suffer if our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could have a material adverse effect on us and lead to a decline in the price of our common units.\nIn addition, sustaining our growth also requires us to commit additional management, operational, and financial resources to identify new professionals to join the firm and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe control of our general partner may be transferred without common unitholder consent.\nOur general partner may transfer all or any part of its general partner interest without the consent of our common unitholders. Furthermore, at any time, the member of our general partner may sell or transfer all or part of its interests in our general partner without the approval of the common unitholders. A new general partner may not be willing or able to form new funds and could form funds that have investment objectives and governing terms that differ materially from those of our current funds. A new owner could also have a different investment philosophy, employ investment professionals who are less experienced, be unsuccessful in identifying investment opportunities or have a track record that is not as successful as our track record. If any of the foregoing were to occur, we could experience difficulty in making new investments, and the value of our existing investments, our businesses, our results of operations and our financial condition could materially suffer.\nOur ability to pay distributions to our common unitholders may be limited by our holding partnership structure, applicable provisions of Delaware law and contractual restrictions or obligations.\nAs a holding partnership, our ability to pay distributions will be subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide cash to us. Ares Management, L.P. has no material assets other than investments in the Ares Operating Group entities, either directly or through direct or indirect subsidiaries. We have no independent means of generating revenues. Accordingly, we intend to cause the Ares Operating Group entities to make distributions to their members and partners, including Ares Management, L.P.\u2019s direct or indirect subsidiaries, to fund any distributions Ares Management, L.P. may declare on the common units. If the Ares Operating Group entities make such distributions, all holders of Ares Operating Group Units will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on their partnership interests in the Ares Operating Group.\nBecause our direct subsidiary, Ares Holdings, Inc. (\u201cAHI\u201d), is taxable as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is subject to entity-level income taxes and may be obligated to make payments under the tax receivable agreement, the amounts ultimately distributed by Ares Management, L.P. to common unitholders are generally expected to be less, on a per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the Ares Operating Group to the holders of Ares Operating Group Units in respect of their Ares Operating Group Units. In addition, each Ares Operating Group entity has issued a series of preferred units (\u201cGP Mirror Units\u201d) with economic terms designed to mirror those of the Series A Preferred Units. The GP Mirror Units pay the same 7.00% rate per annum to our wholly owned subsidiaries, including AHI, that we pay on our Series A Preferred Units. Although income allocated in respect of distributions on the GP Mirror Units made to AHI is subject to tax, cash distributions to holders of Series A Preferred units will not be reduced on account of any income taxes owed by AHI.\nThe declaration and payment of any future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our general partner, which may change our distribution policy at any time. There can be no assurance that any distributions, whether quarterly or otherwise, can or will be paid. Our ability to make cash distributions to our common unitholders depends on a number of factors, including among other things, general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and other anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations, including fulfilling our current and future capital commitments, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, restrictions and other implications on the payment of distributions by us to our common unitholders or by our subsidiaries to us, payments required pursuant to the tax receivable agreement and such other factors as our general partner may deem relevant.\nUnder the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the \u201cDelaware Limited Partnership Act\u201d), we may not make a distribution to a partner if after the distribution all our liabilities, other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership, would exceed the fair value of our assets. If we were to make such an impermissible distribution, any limited partner who received a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act would be liable to us for the amount of the distribution for three years. In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility or other financing arrangements may from time to time include covenants or other restrictions that could constrain our ability to make distributions. In addition, the Ares Operating Group\u2019s cash flow may be insufficient to enable them to make required minimum tax distributions to their members and partners, in which case the Ares Operating Group may have to borrow funds or sell assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. Our partnership agreement contains provisions authorizing us to issue additional partnership interests that have designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to our common units on the terms and conditions determined by our general partner in its sole discretion at any time without common unitholder approval.\nFurthermore, by making cash distributions rather than investing that cash in our businesses, we risk slowing the pace of our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations, new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures, should the need arise.\nWe will be required to pay the TRA Recipients for most of the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax basis step-up we receive in subsequent sales or exchanges of Ares Operating Group Units and related transactions. In certain circumstances, payments to the TRA Recipients may be accelerated and/or could significantly exceed the actual tax benefits we realize.\nThe holders of Ares Operating Group Units, subject to any applicable transfer restrictions and other provisions, may, on a quarterly basis, from and after May 7, 2016 (the second anniversary of the date of the closing of our initial public offering) (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), exchange their Ares Operating Group Units for our common units on a one-for-one basis (provided that Alleghany may exchange up to half of its Ares Operating Group Units from and after the first anniversary of our initial public offering and former employees of EIF and their related parties are entitled to exchange all of their Ares Operating Group Units) or, at our option, for cash. A holder of Ares Operating Group Units must exchange one Ares Operating Group Unit in each of the three Ares Operating Group entities to effect an exchange for a common unit of Ares Management, L.P. Subsequent exchanges are expected to result in increases (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the relevant Ares Operating Group entity. These increases in tax basis generally will increase (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and potentially reduce gain on sales of assets and, therefore, reduce the amount of tax that Ares Management, L.P.\u2019s direct subsidiaries that are taxable as corporations for U.S. federal tax purposes, which we refer to as the \u201ccorporate taxpayers,\u201d would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of these deductions and tax basis increases, and a court could sustain such a challenge.\nWe have entered into a tax receivable agreement with certain direct and indirect holders of AOG Units (the \u201cTRA Recipients\u201d) that provides for the payment by the corporate taxpayers to the TRA Recipients of 85% of the amount of cash tax\nsavings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax or franchise tax that the corporate taxpayers actually realize (or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by the corporate taxpayers or a change of control, as discussed below) as a result of increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. The payments our corporate taxpayers may make to the TRA Recipients could be material in amount and we may need to incur debt to finance payments under the tax receivable agreement if our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise. Assuming that the market value of a common unit were to be equal to $19.20 per common unit, which is the closing price per common unit as of December 31, 2016, and that LIBOR were to be 1.25%, we estimate that the aggregate amount of these termination payments would be approximately $642.0 million. The foregoing amount is merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ materially.\nIf the IRS were to challenge a tax basis increase (or the ability to amortize such increase), the TRA Recipients will not reimburse us for any payments previously made to them under the tax receivable agreement. The corporate taxpayers\u2019 ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under the tax receivable agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, as discussed above, including the timing and amount of our future income. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments to the TRA Recipients under the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of the corporate taxpayers\u2019 cash tax savings.\nIn addition, the tax receivable agreement provides that, upon a change of control, or if, at any time, the corporate taxpayer elects an early termination of the tax receivable agreement, the corporate taxpayer's obligations under the tax receivables agreement with respect to exchanged or acquired units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such change of control) would be based on certain assumptions, including that the corporate taxpayer would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement and, in the case of an early termination election, that any Ares Operating Group Units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the common units at the time of termination. See \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d\nTax consequences to the direct and indirect holders of Ares Operating Group Units may give rise to conflicts of interests.\nAs a result of the tax gain inherent in our assets held by the Ares Operating Group at the time of this report, upon a realization event, certain direct and indirect holders of Ares Operating Group Units may incur different and potentially significantly greater tax liabilities as a result of the disproportionately greater allocations of items of taxable income and gain to such holders. As these direct and indirect holders will not receive a corresponding greater distribution of cash proceeds, they may, subject to applicable fiduciary or contractual duties, have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing, timing and other material terms of any sale, refinancing, or disposition, or whether to sell such assets at all. Decisions made with respect to an acceleration or deferral of income or the sale or disposition of assets with unrealized built-in tax gains may also influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by the TRA Recipients (including, among others, the Holdco Members and other executive officers) under the tax receivable agreement. In general, we anticipate that earlier disposition of assets with unrealized built-in tax gains following such exchange will tend to accelerate such payments and increase the present value of the tax receivable agreement, and disposition of assets with unrealized built-in tax gains before an exchange generally will increase an exchanging holder\u2019s tax liability without giving rise to any rights to any payments under the tax receivable agreement. Decisions made regarding a change of control also could have a material influence on the timing and amount of payments received by the TRA Recipients pursuant to the tax receivable agreement.\nWe are a limited partnership and as a result will qualify for and intend to rely on exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements under the rules of the NYSE.\nWe are a limited partnership and qualify for exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements of the rules of the NYSE. Pursuant to these exceptions, limited partnerships may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, including the requirements that (i) a majority of the board of directors of our general partner consist of independent directors, (ii) we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors, (iii) we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (iv) the compensation committee consider certain independence factors when engaging compensation consultants, legal counsel and other committee advisers. In addition, we are not required to hold annual meetings of our common unitholders. We have availed ourselves of these exceptions. Accordingly, holders of our common units do not have the same protections afforded to equityholders of entities that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nWe are a Delaware limited partnership, and there are certain provisions in our partnership agreement regarding exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors that differ from the Delaware General Corporation Law in a manner that may be less protective of the interests of our unitholders.\nOur partnership agreement provides that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law the directors and officers of our general partner will not be liable to us unless they act in bad faith or with criminal intent. However, under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director or officer would be liable to us for (i) breach of duty of loyalty to us or our equityholders, (ii) intentional misconduct or knowing violations of the law that are not done in good faith, (iii) improper redemption of units or declaration of dividend or (iv) a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. In addition, our partnership agreement provides that we indemnify the directors and officers of our general partner for acts or omissions to the fullest extent provided by law unless they act in bad faith or with criminal intent. However, under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation can only indemnify directors and officers for acts or omissions if the director or officer acted in good faith, in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation, and, in criminal action, if the officer or director had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Accordingly, our partnership agreement is less protective of the interests of our common unitholders, when compared to the Delaware General Corporation Law, insofar as it relates to the exculpation and indemnification of officers and directors.\nRisks Related to Our Preferred and Common Units\nThe market price and trading volume of our common units may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our common unitholders.\nThe market price of our common units may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common units may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common units declines significantly, holders of our common units may be unable to resell their common units at or above their purchase price, if at all. The market price of our common units may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our common units or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common units include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results or distributions, which variations we expect will be substantial;\n\u2022\nour policy of taking a long-term perspective on making investment, operational and strategic decisions, which is expected to result in significant and unpredictable variations in our quarterly returns;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or the investment management industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common units;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of our senior professionals and other key management personnel;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nchanges or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our businesses or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u2022\na lack of liquidity in the trading of our common units;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about the asset management industry generally or, more specifically, private equity fund practices or individual scandals; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\nIn the past few years, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against public companies. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe tax attributes of our common units may cause mutual funds to limit or reduce their holdings of common units.\nU.S. mutual funds that are treated as regulated investment companies (\u201cRICs\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of their investment company taxable income to their shareholders to maintain their favorable U.S. income tax status. RICs generally are required to meet this distribution requirement regardless of whether their investments generate cash distributions equal to their taxable income. Accordingly, these investors\nhave a strong incentive to invest in securities in which the amount of cash generated is at least equal to the amount of taxable income recognized. Our common unitholders, however, may be allocated an amount of income and gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes that exceeds the amount of cash we distribute to them. Additionally, for non-U.S. investors in RICs, certain complex rules may limit the benefits of investing in a RIC to the extent that such RIC\u2019s holdings include our common units. This may make it difficult for RICs to maintain a meaningful portion of their portfolio in our common units and may force those RICs that do hold our common units to sell all or a portion of their holdings of our common units. These actions could increase the supply of, and reduce the demand for, our common units, which could cause the price of our common units to decline.\nAn investment in our common units is not an investment in any of our funds, and the assets and revenues of our funds are not directly available to us.\nCommon unitholders will not directly participate in the performance of our underlying funds, and any benefits from such performance will directly inure to investors in those funds. Our common units are securities of Ares Management, L.P. only. While our historical consolidated financial information includes financial information, including assets and revenues, of our funds on a consolidated basis, and our future financial information will continue to consolidate certain of these funds, such assets and revenues are available to the fund and not to us except to a limited extent through management fees, performance fees, distributions and other proceeds arising from agreements with funds, as discussed in more detail in this report.\nThe market price of our common units may decline due to the large number of common units eligible for exchange and future sale.\nThe market price of our common units could decline as a result of sales of a large number of common units in the market in the future or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell common units in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Subject to the lock-up restrictions described below, we may issue and sell in the future additional common units.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our senior professional owners owned, indirectly, an aggregate of 117,928,313 Ares Operating Group Units. We have entered into an exchange agreement with the holders of Ares Operating Group Units so that such holders, subject to any applicable transfer and other restrictions, may up to four times each year from and after May 7, 2016 (the second anniversary of the date of our initial public offering) (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) exchange their Ares Operating Group Units for our common units on a one-for-one basis (provided that Alleghany may exchange all of its Ares Operating Group Units from and after May 7, 2016), subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications, or, at our option, for cash. A holder of Ares Operating Group Units must exchange one Ares Operating Group Unit in each of the three Ares Operating Group entities to effect an exchange for a common unit of Ares Management, L.P. The common units we issue upon such exchanges would be \u201crestricted securities,\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, unless we register such issuances.\nAres Owners Holdings L.P., ADIA and Alleghany (together with ADIA, the \u201cStrategic Investors\u201d) have the right, under certain circumstances and subject to certain restrictions, to require us to register under the Securities Act common units delivered in exchange for Ares Operating Group Units or common units of Ares Management, L.P. otherwise held by them. In addition, we may be required to make available shelf registration statements permitting sales of common units into the market from time to time over an extended period. Lastly, Ares Owners Holdings L.P. and the Strategic Investors will have the ability to exercise certain piggyback registration rights in respect of common units held by them in connection with registered offerings requested by other registration rights holders or initiated by us. See \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Investor Rights Agreement.\u201d See \u201cItem 11. Executive Compensation-Director Compensation-Common Units and Ares Operating Group Units.\u201d However, transfers may occur notwithstanding such restrictions pursuant to transactions or programs approved by our general partner.\nUnder our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, we have granted options to purchase 24,835,227 common units and 4,936,051 restricted units to be settled in common units, which are subject to specified vesting requirements, to certain of our senior professionals. During the course of 2016, awards representing 2,367,560 common units were forfeited and became available for issuance under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2016, 30,397,280 additional common units were available for award under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. We have filed two registration statements and intend to file more registration statements on Form S-8 with the Commission covering the common units issuable under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. Subject to vesting and contractual lock-up arrangements (including through May 1, 2019 for restricted units granted in connection with our initial public offering.), upon effectiveness of the relevant registration statement on Form S-8, such common units are freely tradable.\nIn addition, our partnership agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities\nand options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to partnership securities for the consideration and on the terms and conditions determined by our general partner in its sole discretion without the approval of any limited partners. In accordance with the Delaware Limited Partnership Act and the provisions of our partnership agreement, we may also issue additional partnership interests that have certain designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to our common and Series A Preferred units. Similarly, the governing agreements of the Ares Operating Group entities authorize the direct subsidiaries of Ares Management, L.P. which are the general partners of those entities to issue an unlimited number of additional units of the Ares Operating Group entity with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to the Ares Operating Group Units, and which may be exchangeable for our common units.\nWe cannot assure holders of our common units that our intended distributions will be paid each quarter or at all.\nOur intention is to distribute to our common unitholders on a quarterly basis substantially all of Ares Management, L.P.\u2019s share of distributable earnings, net of applicable corporate taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement, in excess of amounts determined by our general partner to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our businesses, to make appropriate investments in our businesses and our funds, to comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements or to provide for future distributions to our common unitholders for any ensuing quarter, subject to a base quarterly distribution in a target range of 80% to 90% of distributable earnings. The declaration, payment and determination of the amount of quarterly distributions, if any, will be at the sole discretion of our general partner, which may change our distribution policy at any time. We cannot assure our common unitholders that any distributions, whether quarterly or otherwise, can or will be paid. In making decisions regarding our quarterly distribution, our general partner considers general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and other anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations, legal, tax, regulatory and other restrictions that may have implications on the payment of distributions by us to our common unitholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our general partner may deem relevant.\nDistributions on the Series A Preferred Units are discretionary and non-cumulative.\nDistributions on the Series A Preferred Units are discretionary and non-cumulative. Holders of our Series A Preferred Units will only receive distributions when, as and if declared by the board of directors of our general partner. Consequently, if the board of directors of our general partner does not authorize and declare a distribution for a distribution period, holders of the Series A Preferred Units would not be entitled to receive any distribution for such distribution period, and such unpaid distribution will not be payable in such distribution period or in later distribution periods. We will have no obligation to pay distributions for a distribution period if the board of directors of our general partner does not declare such distribution before the scheduled record date for such period, whether or not distributions are declared or paid for any subsequent distribution period with respect to the Series A Preferred Units or any other preferred units we may issue. This may result in holders of the Series A Preferred Units not receiving the full amount of distributions that they expect to receive, or any distributions, and may make it more difficult to resell Series A Preferred Units or to do so at a price that the holder finds attractive. The board of directors of our general partner may, in its sole discretion, determine to suspend distributions on the Series A Preferred Units, which may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurances that our operations will generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to pay distributions on the Series A Preferred Units. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic and industry conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nThe U.S. Congress has considered legislative proposals that, if enacted, would subject us to U.S. federal income tax as a corporation on our net income which would materially increase our U.S. federal income tax liability, could materially reduce the amount available for distribution to unitholders and would materially alter the tax considerations in connection with an investment in, the ownership of and the disposition of our units.\nOn several occasions in recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislative proposals that, if enacted, would repeal the exception from taxation as a corporation currently available to certain publicly traded partnerships. Enactment of any such legislation likely would materially increase our entity-level tax liability, and therefore reduce amounts otherwise available for us to distribute to holders of our units. In addition, if we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, ownership of our units would have the same U.S. federal income tax considerations as ownership of stock of a corporation. As a result, any such proposal that is ultimately enacted into law would materially alter the U.S. federal income tax considerations in connection with an investment in, the ownership of and the disposition of our units. As of the date of this report, it is not possible to predict if, whether or when any proposal previously introduced, or a similar proposal, might be enacted, in what form or with what effective date. Investors should discuss with their own tax advisors the possibility that we might cease to be treated as a partnership for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes and other possible changes in tax law.\nOver the past several years, there have been legislative proposals that, if enacted, would tax certain unitholders with respect to certain of our income and gains at increased rates. If such legislation, or similar legislation, were to be enacted, a substantial portion of our income, as well as gain from the disposition of units, could be taxed at a higher rate to certain unitholders.\nOver the past several years, there have been proposals by both Congress and the executive branch, as well as from states and other jurisdictions, that, if enacted, generally would cause, among other things, some or all of a partner\u2019s share of certain partnership income and certain income realized upon a disposition of partnership interests, that, in each case, otherwise would be treated as long-term capital gains for U.S. federal income tax purposes to be recharacterized as ordinary income, and therefore potentially subject to a higher rate of U.S. federal income tax (or higher state or local tax rates). It is unclear when or whether Congress will pass such legislation or what provisions will be included in any legislation, if enacted.\nSome legislative and administrative proposals have provided that, for taxable years beginning after the date of enactment (or, in some cases, beginning ten years after the date of enactment), income derived with respect to carried interest would not meet the qualifying income requirements under publicly traded partnership rules. Therefore, if similar legislation is enacted, following such enactment (or such ten-year period), we would be precluded from qualifying as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the IRS and the Treasury Department have issued proposed regulations that could have implications with respect to whether certain types of income inclusions under current anti-deferral regimes may consist of qualifying income to us, if the inclusion is not accompanied by an actual cash distribution. If we were taxed as a U.S. corporation, our effective tax rate would increase significantly. The federal statutory tax rate for corporations is currently 35%. In addition, we could be subject to increased state and local taxes. Furthermore, unitholders could be subject to tax on our conversion into a corporation. As of the date of this report, it is not possible to predict whether or when any proposal previously introduced, or a similar proposal, might be enacted, in what form or with what effective date. If such proposals, or similar proposals, were to be enacted, the tax liability of certain of our unitholders could increase significantly and our ability to fund cash distributions could be reduced.\nAdditional proposed changes in the U.S. and foreign taxation of businesses could adversely affect us.\nMost recently, members of Congress and the Trump administration have raised reform proposals that would dramatically change the U.S. federal tax system. These proposals would meaningfully reduce individual and corporate tax rates and under one or more of those proposals, would convert the federal income tax system into a \u201cdestination-based cash flow\u201d tax system, under which, net interest expense would not be deductible, investment in tangible property and intangible assets (other than land) would be immediately deductible, export revenue would not be taxable, and the cost of imports would not be deductible. We cannot predict whether and to what extent these proposals, or any other legislative or administrative changes, if and when enacted, could affect the value of any investments made by us, and the tax consequences to us and our unitholders; however, such consequences could be significant.\nCongress, HM Treasury, the OECD and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates invest or do business have maintained a focus on issues related to the taxation of businesses, including multinational entities. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued guidance through its BEPS project that contemplates changes to longstanding international tax norms that determine each country\u2019s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade and profits. On June 29, 2016, the Treasury Department and the IRS issued final regulations that would require the parent entity of certain U.S. multinational enterprise groups to file an annual report that would provide information on a country-by-country basis related to the group\u2019s income and taxes paid. These changes in law or guidance and additional proposals for reform, if enacted by the United States or by other countries in which we or our affiliates invest or do business or, even if not enacted, could adversely affect our investment returns, including by increasing our tax compliance costs. Whether these or other proposals will be enacted by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction and in what form is unknown, as are the ultimate consequences of any such proposed legislation.\nOur structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure also is subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of our unitholders depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Additionally, changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof could make it more difficult or impossible to satisfy the requirements for us to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not taxable as a corporation, affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments, affect the tax considerations of an investment in us, change the character or treatment of portions of our income and adversely affect an investment in our units. Additionally, our\norganizational documents and governing agreements permit our general partner to modify our partnership agreement from time to time, without the consent of our unitholders, to address certain changes in U.S. federal income tax regulations, legislation or interpretation. In some circumstances, such revisions could have a material adverse impact on some or all of our unitholders.\nIf, pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the \u201c2015 Act\u201d), any audit by the IRS of our income tax returns for any fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2017 results in any adjustments, the IRS may collect any resulting taxes, including any applicable penalties and interest, directly from us, in which case the cash available for distributions to our unitholders may be substantially reduced.\nUnder current law, when the IRS audits a partnership tax return, the IRS generally determines tax adjustments at the partnership level, but is required to collect any additional taxes, interest and penalties from each of the partners. The 2015 Act changed this procedure for partnership tax audits and audit adjustments for partnership returns for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nPursuant to the 2015 Act, if any audit by the IRS of our income tax returns for any fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2017 results in any adjustments, the IRS may collect any resulting taxes, including any applicable penalties and interest, directly from us. Generally, we will have the ability to collect such tax liability from our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will elect to do so or be able to do so under all circumstances. If we do not collect such tax liability from our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us in the tax year under audit, our available cash for quarterly distributions to current unitholders may be substantially reduced. Accordingly, our common unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units during the tax year under audit.\nIn January 2017, the IRS issued proposed regulations that implement the provisions of the 2015 Act. These regulations, however, have been withdrawn in response to a freeze on the publication of new regulations effected by the Trump administration.\nIf we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax or state tax purposes, then the amount available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced and the value of our units would be adversely affected.\nAn entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes may nonetheless be treated as, and taxable as, a corporation if it is a \u201cpublicly traded partnership\u201d unless an exception to such treatment applies. An entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership is a publicly traded partnership if interests in the entity are traded on an established securities market or interests in the entity are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof, and we believe we are publicly traded for this purpose. However, a publicly traded partnership can avoid being treated as a corporation by satisfying the \u201cQualifying Income Exception,\u201d which requires at least 90% of such entity\u2019s gross income (determined under specific tax rules) for every taxable year that it is a publicly traded partnership consist of qualifying income (which generally includes certain interest income, dividends, real property rents, gains from the sale or other disposition of real property, and gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset or other property held for the production of income that otherwise constitutes qualifying income), and the entity must not be required to register under the Investment Advisers Act. We intend to manage our affairs so that we will meet the Qualifying Income Exception in 2017 and each succeeding taxable year to be treated as a partnership and not as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf we failed to meet the requirements described above and, as a result, we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, we would be subject to U.S. corporate income tax on our U.S. taxable income at regular corporate rates and our cash available for distribution would be reduced. Accordingly, our being treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes could materially reduce our unitholders\u2019 after-tax return and thus could substantially reduce the value of our units.\nOur common unitholders will be required to take into account their allocable share of our taxable income and gain, regardless of whether they receive any cash distributions from us.\nAs long as we are treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership, and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation, our common unitholders will be required to take into account their allocable share of our items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit on an annual basis in calculating their U.S. federal income taxable income.\nAs a result, our common unitholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their allocable share of our items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit (including our allocable share of those items of any entity in which we invest that is treated as a partnership or is otherwise subject to tax on a flow through basis) for each of our taxable years ending with or within their taxable years, regardless of whether or not our common unitholders receive cash distributions from us. Additionally, our common\nunitholders may not receive cash distributions equal to their allocable share of our net taxable income or gain, or even the amount of their U.S. federal, state and local income tax liability that results from that income or gain. Also, certain of our holdings, such as stock in a controlled foreign corporation or a passive foreign investment company or an entity that is fiscally transparent or a financial conduit for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may produce taxable income prior to the receipt of cash relating to such income, and common unitholders that are U.S. taxpayers generally will be required to take such income into account in determining their U.S. federal taxable income. In the event of an inadvertent termination of our partnership status, and provided that the IRS were to grant to us limited relief available under statute, each holder of our common units would be obligated to make adjustments as required by the IRS to maintain our status as a partnership. In such a circumstance, such adjustments may require persons holding our common units to recognize additional amounts of taxable income in respect of the taxable years to which such allocations applied.\nIf the amount of distributions on the Series A Preferred Units is greater than our gross ordinary income, then the amount that a holder of Series A Preferred Units would receive upon liquidation may be less than the Preferred Unit Liquidation Value.\nIn general, to the extent of our gross ordinary income in any taxable year, we will specially allocate to the Series A Preferred Units items of our gross ordinary income in an amount equal to the distributions paid in respect of the Series A Preferred Units during the taxable year. Allocations of gross ordinary income will increase the capital account balance of the holders of the Series A Preferred Units. Distributions will correspondingly reduce the capital account balance of the holders of the Series A Preferred Units. So long as our gross ordinary income equals or exceeds the distributions paid to the holders of the Series A Preferred Units, the capital account balance of the holders of Series A Preferred Units will equal the sum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per Series A Preferred Unit and declared and unpaid distributions, if any, to, but excluding, the date we liquidate, dissolve or wind up (the \u201cPreferred Unit Liquidation Value\u201d) at the end of each taxable year. If the distributions paid in respect of the Series A Preferred Units during a taxable year exceed the amount of our gross ordinary income for such year, however, the capital account balance of the holders of the Series A Preferred Units will be reduced below the Preferred Unit Liquidation Value by the amount of such excess. In that event, to the extent of our gross ordinary income in any taxable year, we will allocate additional gross ordinary income in subsequent years until such excess is eliminated. If we were to have insufficient gross ordinary income to eliminate such excess, holders of Series A Preferred Units would be entitled, upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, to less than the Preferred Unit Liquidation Value. In addition, if we make additional allocations of gross ordinary income in a taxable year to eliminate such excess from prior years, the gross ordinary income allocated to holders of the Series A Preferred Units in such taxable year would exceed the distributions paid to the Series A Preferred Units during such taxable year. In such years, holders of Series A Preferred Units would recognize taxable income in excess of our cash distributions, which could give rise to a tax liability for such holders that must be satisfied from sources other than our cash distributions.\nUnitholders will be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements as a result of owning our units.\nIn addition to U.S. federal income taxes, our unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes, that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future, even if our common unitholders do not reside in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders may be required to file state and local income tax returns in some or all of these jurisdictions and may be required to pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these jurisdictions. Further, unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. It is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all U.S. federal, state and local tax returns that may be required of such common unitholder.\nCertain of our businesses are held through entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which will reduce the amount available for distributions to holders of our common units in respect of such investments and could adversely affect the value of our common unitholders\u2019 investment.\nTo comply with the publicly traded partnership rules under U.S. federal income tax law and other requirements, we hold our interest in certain of our businesses through AHI and Ares Offshore Holdings Ltd., which are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may hold additional interests in other businesses through other entities treated as corporations. Such corporations could be liable for significant U.S. federal income taxes and applicable state and local taxes that would not otherwise be incurred, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distributions to holders of our common units and adversely affect the value of their investment.\nIn addition, the GP Mirror Units pay the same 7.00% rate per annum to our wholly owned subsidiaries, including AHI, that we pay on our Series A Preferred Units. Although income allocated in respect of distributions on the GP Mirror Units made to AHI is subject to tax, cash distributions to holders of Series A Preferred units will not be reduced on account of any income taxes owed by AHI.\nTax gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.\nIf our common unitholders sell their common units, they will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their adjusted tax basis in those common units. Prior distributions to our common unitholders in excess of the total net taxable income allocated to them, which decreased the tax basis in their common units, will in effect become taxable income or gain to the holders of our common units if the common units are sold at a price greater than the unitholder\u2019s tax basis in those common units, even if the price is less than the original cost. A portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be ordinary income to the common unitholder.\nBecause we do not intend to make, or cause to be made, an otherwise available election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code to adjust our asset basis or the asset basis of certain of the Ares Operating Group entities, a holder of units could be allocated more taxable income in respect of those units prior to disposition than if we had made such an election.\nWe have not made and currently do not intend to make, or cause to be made, an election to adjust asset basis under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to us or Ares Investments L.P. If no such election is made, there generally will be no adjustment to the basis of the assets of Ares Investments L.P. upon our acquisition of interests in Ares Investments L.P., or to our assets or to the assets of Ares Investments L.P. upon a subsequent transferee\u2019s acquisition of units from a prior holder of such units, even if the purchase price for those interests or units, as applicable, is greater than the share of the aggregate tax basis of our assets or the assets of Ares Investments L.P. attributable to those interests or units immediately prior to the acquisition. Consequently, upon a sale of an asset by us or Ares Investments L.P., gain allocable to a holder of units could include built-in gain in the asset existing at the time we acquired those interests, or such holder acquired such units, which built-in gain would otherwise generally be eliminated if we had made a Section 754 election.\nOur units may not be uniform, which could result in IRS examination of our tax returns and the tax returns of our unitholders, and could have a negative impact on the value of our unitholder\u2019s investment.\nWe cannot match transferors and transferees of our units, and as a result we will adopt depreciation, amortization and other tax accounting positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders, and could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on the sale of our units. This could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audits of and adjustments to our U.S. federal tax returns and the tax returns of our unitholders.\nIn addition, our taxable income and losses will be determined and apportioned among investors using conventions we regard as consistent with applicable law. As a result, if our unitholders transfer their units, they may be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us after the date of transfer. Similarly, a transferee may be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of the transferee\u2019s acquisition of our units. A transferee may also bear the cost of withholding tax imposed with respect to income allocated to a transferor through a reduction in the cash distributed to the transferee.\nThe sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profit interests will result in the termination of our partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profit interests within a 12-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and may result in more than 12 months of our taxable income or loss being includable in the holder\u2019s taxable income for the year of termination. A termination could also result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination had occurred.\nNon-U.S. persons could face different U.S. tax issues from owning units than U.S. persons, and such differences may result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nSome of our investment activities may cause us to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case some portion of our income would be treated as effectively connected income (\u201cECI\u201d) with respect to a non-U.S. Holders. A \u201cnon-U.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of the units that is not a U.S. Holder (generally, a common unitholder that is a \u201cUnited States person\u201d within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) and is not an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, dividends received from an investment that we make in a REIT that are attributable to gains from the sale of U.S. real property interests and sales of certain investments in interests in U.S. real property, including stock of certain U.S. corporations owning significant U.S. real property, may be treated as ECI with respect to non-U.S. Holders that are not qualified pension plans, entities wholly owned by qualified pension plans or certain foreign publicly traded entities. In addition, certain income of non-U.S. Holders from U.S. sources not connected to any such U.S. trade or business conducted\nby us could be treated as ECI. To the extent our income is treated as ECI, non-U.S. Holders generally would be subject to withholding tax on their allocable shares of such income, would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return for such year reporting their allocable shares of income effectively connected with such trade or business and any other income treated as ECI, and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular U.S. tax rates on any such income. Non-U.S. Holders that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax on their allocable share of such income. In addition, certain income from U.S. sources that is not ECI allocable to non-U.S. Holders will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest effective applicable tax rate. Finally, if we are treated as being engaged in a U.S. trade or business, a portion of any gain recognized by non-U.S. unitholders on the sale or exchange of units may be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as ECI, and hence such non-U.S. unitholders could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the sale or exchange of units.\nGenerally, under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (\u201cFIRPTA\u201d) provisions of the Code, certain non-U.S. persons are subject to U.S. federal income tax in the same manner as U.S. persons on any gain realized on the disposition of an interest, other than an interest solely as a creditor, in U.S. real property. In December 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 was signed into law providing some exemptions from FIRPTA tax for certain types of non-U.S. persons. An interest in U.S. real property includes stock in a U.S. corporation (except for certain stock of publicly traded U.S. corporations) if interests in U.S. real property constitute 50% or more by value of the sum of the corporation\u2019s assets used in a trade or business, its U.S. real property interests and its interests in real property located outside the United States (a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d). The FIRPTA tax applies to certain non-U.S. holders holding an interest in a partnership that realizes gain in respect of an interest in U.S. real property or an interest in a USRPHC. We may, from time to time, make certain investments (other than direct investments in U.S. real property), for example, through one of our investment funds held by Ares Investments that could constitute investments in U.S. real property or USRPHCs. If we make such investments certain non- U.S. holders will be subject to U.S. federal income tax under FIRPTA on such holder\u2019s allocable share of any gain we realize on the disposition of a FIRPTA interest and will be subject to the tax return filing requirements regarding ECI discussed above.\nNon-U.S. persons may face adverse tax consequences in their countries of residence from owning units.\nAres Management, L.P. will own interests in one or more entities in which no member has unlimited liability and which is treated as a fiscally transparent pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or a \u201chybrid entity,\u201d such as a limited liability company. It is possible that a non-U.S. jurisdiction will treat such a hybrid entity as fiscally opaque. In that case, a non-U.S. Holder could be subject to different results in respect of timing and character of income and gain recognition, as well as the availability of losses, credits or deductions, including in respect of any taxes paid or deemed paid by or on behalf of the non-U.S. Holder, in such non-U.S. jurisdiction.\nTax-exempt entities face special U.S. federal income tax issues from owning units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nA tax-exempt partner of a partnership generally must include in computing its \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d (\u201cUBTI\u201d) its pro rata share (whether or not distributed) of such partnership\u2019s gross income derived from a trade or business conducted by such partnership which is unrelated to the exempt function of the tax-exempt partner. Moreover, a tax-exempt partner of a partnership could be treated as earning UBTI to the extent that such partnership derives income from \u201cdebt-financed property,\u201d or if the partnership interest itself is debt financed. Debt-financed property means property held to produce income with respect to which there is \u201cacquisition indebtedness\u201d (i.e., indebtedness incurred in acquiring or holding property). We are under no obligation to minimize UBTI, and a U.S. Holder of our units that is a tax-exempt organization for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, generally exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, may be subject to \u201cunrelated business income tax\u201d to the extent, if any, that its allocable share of our income consists of UBTI.\nWe may not be able to furnish to each unitholder specific tax information within 90 days after the close of each calendar year, which means that our unitholders who are U.S. taxpayers may anticipate the need to file annually a request for an extension of the due date of their income tax return. In addition, it is possible that unitholders who are otherwise required to file U.S. federal income tax returns may be required to file amended income tax returns.\nWe have agreed to furnish to each unitholder, as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of each taxable year, tax information (including Schedule K-1), which describes on a U.S. dollar basis such holder\u2019s share of our taxable income, gain, loss, deduction and credit for our preceding taxable year. It may require longer than 90 days after the end of our fiscal year to obtain the requisite information from all lower-tier entities. Consequently, holders of our units who are U.S. taxpayers or otherwise required to file U.S. tax returns may need to file annually with the IRS (and, if applicable, certain states) a request for an extension past the applicable due date of their income tax return for the taxable year. In addition, each unitholder generally is required to file U.S. federal and state tax returns consistently with the information provided by us for the taxable year for all relevant tax purposes. In preparing this information, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions, some of which have been\nmentioned in the previous discussion, to determine such holder\u2019s share of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit. The IRS or state tax authorities may successfully contend that certain of these reporting conventions are impermissible, which could result in an adjustment to such holder\u2019s income or loss and could result in an increase in overall tax due. Additionally, we may be audited by taxing authorities from time to time. Adjustments resulting from a tax audit may require a holder to adjust a prior year\u2019s tax liability and possibly may result in an audit of such holder\u2019s own tax return. Any audit of such holder\u2019s tax return could result in adjustments not related to our tax returns as well as those related to our tax returns, and could result in an increase in overall tax due.\nWe may hold or acquire certain investments through entities classified as PFICs or CFCs for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nCertain of our investments may be in foreign corporations or may be acquired through a foreign subsidiary that would be classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such an entity may be a passive foreign investment company (a \u201cPFIC\u201d) or a controlled foreign corporation (a \u201cCFC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders of units considered to own an interest in a PFIC or a CFC may experience adverse U.S. federal and state income tax consequences and significantly more complex filing obligations.\nApplicable U.S. tax law could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from certain foreign investors.\nUnder Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such Sections, along with the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act or \u201cFATCA\u201d), a broadly defined class of foreign financial institutions are required to comply with a U.S. tax reporting regime or be subject to certain U.S. withholding taxes. The reporting obligations imposed under FATCA require foreign financial institutions to enter into agreements with the IRS to obtain and disclose information about certain account holders and investors to the IRS (or in the case of certain foreign financial institutions that are resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into an intergovernmental agreement (the \u201cIGA\u201d) to implement this legislation, to comply with comparable non-U.S. laws implementing the IGA). Additionally, certain non-U.S. entities that are not foreign financial institutions are required to provide certain certifications or other information regarding their U.S. beneficial ownership or be subject to certain U.S. withholding taxes under FATCA. Failure to comply with these requirements could expose us and/or our investors to a 30% withholding tax on certain U.S. payments (and beginning in 2019, a 30% withholding tax on gross proceeds from the sale of U.S. stocks and securities), and possibly limit our ability to open bank accounts and secure funding in the global capital markets. There are uncertainties regarding the implementation of FATCA and it is difficult to determine at this time what impact any future administrative guidance may have. The administrative and economic costs of compliance with FATCA may discourage some foreign investors from investing in U.S. funds, which could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from these investors or reduce the demand for our units. Moreover, we expect to incur additional expenses related to our compliance with FATCA, which could increase our tax compliance costs generally. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the Cayman Islands, have implemented regimes similar to that of FATCA.\nCertain U.S. holders of units are subject to additional tax on \u201cnet investment income.\u201d\nU.S. holders of units that are individuals, estates or trusts are subject to a Medicare tax of 3.8% on \u201cnet investment income\u201d (or undistributed \u201cnet investment income,\u201d in the case of estates and trusts) for each taxable year, with such tax applying to the lesser of such income or the excess of such person\u2019s adjusted gross income (with certain adjustments) over a specified amount. Net investment income includes net income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties and rents and net gain attributable to the disposition of investment property. It is anticipated that net income and gain attributable to an investment in our units will be included in U.S. holder\u2019s \u201cnet investment income\u201d subject to this Medicare tax.\nItems of deductions or losses may be adjusted (including by reallocation to other Ares Operating Group entities) or disallowed in a manner that could materially increase the tax liability of our direct subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in particular AHI.\nWhile we have and will continue to allocate items of deductions or losses in good faith and in accordance with our expense allocation policy or practice in effect from time to time, there is no guarantee that our policies or practices will not be challenged by the IRS or state taxing authorities. If the IRS or state taxing authorities were to determine that we have improperly allocated such items of deductions or losses among the Ares Operating Group entities, such items of deductions or losses could be adjusted (including by reallocation to other Ares Operating Group entities) or disallowed in a manner that could materially increase the tax liability of our direct subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in particular AHI.", "PERMNO": 14617, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "ARES"}
