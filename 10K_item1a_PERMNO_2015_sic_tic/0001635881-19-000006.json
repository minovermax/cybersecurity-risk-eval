{"cik": "1635881", "company": "Exterran Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs described in Part I (\u201cDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d), this report contains forward-looking statements regarding us, our business and our industry. The risk factors described below, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements. The risk factors described below are not the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. If any of the following risks or any other risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nLow oil and natural gas prices could depress or reduce demand or pricing for our natural gas compression and oil and natural gas processing and treating equipment and services and, as a result, adversely affect our business.\nOur results of operations depend upon the level of activity in the global energy market, including oil and natural gas development, production, processing and transportation. Oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a sustained reduction in oil or natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil or natural gas prices by oil and natural gas exploration, development and production companies can result in their decision to cancel, reduce or postpone major expenditures or to reduce or shut in well production.\nOil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity can be volatile. In periods of volatile commodity prices, the timing of any change in activity levels by our customers is difficult to predict. As a result, our ability to project the anticipated activity level for our business, and particularly our product sales segment may be limited.\nDuring periods of lower oil or natural gas prices, our customers typically decrease their capital expenditures, which generally results in lower activity levels. A reduction in demand for our products and services could force us to reduce our pricing substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, due to the low oil and natural gas price environment during 2015 and the majority of 2016, our customers sought to reduce their capital and operating expenditure requirements, and as a result, the demand and pricing for the equipment we manufacture was adversely impacted. Recently, oil and natural gas prices have declined again, reversing a recent upward trend. We do not know whether this will be a prolonged decline and, if so, whether and to what degree it will impact the demand and pricing for the equipment we manufacture. Any reduction in demand for our products and services could result in our customers seeking to preserve capital by canceling contracts, canceling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression and oil and natural gas processing and treating equipment, ceasing commitments for new contract operations services contracts or new compression and oil and natural gas processing and treating equipment, or canceling or delaying orders for our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers finance their exploration and development activities through cash flows from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. During times when the oil or natural gas markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience a downturn in their financial condition. A reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, the lack of availability of debt or equity financing or other factors that negatively impact our customers\u2019 financial condition could result in our customers seeking to preserve capital by reducing prices under existing contracts or cancelling contracts with us, determining not to renew contracts with us, cancelling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression and oil and natural gas processing and treating equipment, determining not to enter into contract operations agreements or not to purchase new compression and oil and natural gas processing and treating equipment, or determining to cancel or delay orders for our products and services. Any such action by our customers would reduce demand for our products and services. Reduced demand for our products and services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, in the event of the financial failure of a customer, we could experience a loss on all or a portion of our outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer.\nFailure to timely and cost-effectively execute on larger projects could adversely affect our business.\nSome of our projects have a relatively larger size and scope than the majority of our projects, which can translate into more technically challenging conditions or performance specifications for our products and services. Contracts with our customers for these projects typically specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. Any failure to estimate the cost of and execute these larger projects in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur losses on fixed-price contracts, which constitute a significant portion of our business.\nIn connection with projects and services performed under fixed-price contracts, we generally bear the risk of cost over-runs, operating cost inflation, labor availability and productivity, and supplier and subcontractor pricing and performance, unless additional costs result from customer-requested change orders. Under both our fixed-price contracts and our cost-reimbursable contracts, we may rely on third parties for many support services, and we could be subject to liability for their failures. Any failure to accurately estimate our costs and the time required for a fixed-price project at the time we enter into a contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations in international markets are subject to many risks.\nThe majority of our contract operations and aftermarket services businesses, and a portion of our product sales business, are conducted in countries outside the U.S. We currently operate in approximately 25 countries. With respect to any particular country in which we operate, the risks inherent in our activities may include the following, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing international operations, including our ability to timely and cost effectively execute projects;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, laws or policies by foreign agencies or governments;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\ntraining and retaining qualified personnel in international markets;\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nactions by governments or national oil companies that result in the nullification or renegotiation on less than favorable terms of existing contracts, or otherwise result in the deprivation of contractual rights, and other difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations;\n\u2022\ngovernmental actions that: result in restricting the movement of property or that impede our ability to import or export parts or equipment; require a certain percentage of equipment to contain local or domestic content; or require certain local or domestic ownership, control or employee ratios in order to do business in or obtain special incentives or treatment in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npotentially longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\nchanges in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, including general political unrest, the nationalization of energy related assets, civil uprisings, community protests, blockades, riots, kidnappings, violence associated with drug cartels and terrorist acts;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences or tax law changes;\n\u2022\ncurrency controls or restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nexpropriation, confiscation or nationalization of property without fair compensation;\n\u2022\nthe risk that our international customers may have reduced access to credit because of higher interest rates, reduced bank lending or a deterioration in our customers\u2019 or their lenders\u2019 financial condition;\n\u2022\ncomplications associated with installing, operating and repairing equipment in remote locations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on insurance coverage;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nthe geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences among personnel in different areas of the world; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing new international offices and the risks inherent in establishing new relationships in foreign countries.\nIn addition, we may expand our business in international markets where we have not previously conducted business. The risks inherent in establishing new business ventures, especially in international markets where local customs, laws and business procedures present special challenges, may affect our ability to be successful in these ventures or avoid losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe results of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nWe have subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe more generally; although these subsidiaries do not have significant active operations in the United Kingdom or Europe. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) in a national referendum (\u201cBrexit\u201d). The referendum was advisory, but the United Kingdom initiated its withdrawal process on March 29, 2017. As a result, the United Kingdom has until March 29, 2019 to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal from the E.U. After extensive negotiations, a deal was reached between the United Kingdom and the E.U., but this deal was recently rejected by the House of Commons in the United Kingdom. It is unclear whether a revised agreement will be approved by the House of Commons or whether the United Kingdom could be forced to leave the E.U. without an agreement in place regarding the various trade, immigration and other laws currently negotiated by the E.U. on behalf of its member states. As a result, Brexit has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the E.U. and has given rise to calls for certain regions within the United Kingdom to preserve their place in the E.U. by separating from the United Kingdom, as well as for the governments of other E.U. member states to consider withdrawal.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the exact terms of any Brexit, or whether there will be a negotiated agreement at all, has rippled through the global economy and may in the future have a material and adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of the global financial markets, and significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility as a result. Lack of clarity about applicable future laws, regulations or treaties as the United Kingdom finalizes its withdrawal, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws, employment laws and other rules that would apply to us and our subsidiaries could increase our costs, restrict our access to capital within the United Kingdom and the E.U., depress economic activity globally and decrease foreign direct investment in the United Kingdom.\nIf the United Kingdom and the E.U. are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other E.U. member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the United Kingdom and other E.U. member states or within the European Economic Area overall could be diminished or eliminated. This could affect, amongst other items, the ability to move cash between our United Kingdom and E.U. subsidiaries. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur contract operations segment is dependent on companies that are controlled by the government in which it operates.\nThe countries with our largest contract operations businesses include Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. We generate a significant portion of our revenue in these countries from national oil companies, including Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales in Argentina, Petrobras in Brazil and Petroleos Mexicanos in Mexico. Contracts with national oil companies may expose us to greater commercial, political and operational risks than we assume in other contracts. Our ability to resolve disputes or enforce contractual provisions may be negatively impacted by the significant bargaining leverage that national oil companies have over us. If our national oil company customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the international markets in which we operate.\nWe operate in many international countries and anticipate that there will be instances in which costs and revenues will not be exactly matched with respect to currency denomination. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities that are receivable or payable in currencies other than our subsidiaries\u2019 functional currency are included in our statements of operations. In addition, currency fluctuations cause the U.S. dollar value of our international results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations. A decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As we expand geographically, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In the future, we may utilize derivative instruments to manage the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could potentially impact our future earnings and forecasted cash flows. However, the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency, resulting in our inability to hedge against some or all of these risks.\nSee further discussion of foreign exchange risks under Item 7A \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe are involved in governmental investigations, which may result in substantial financial and other penalties, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nContemporaneously with filing the Form 8-K on April 26, 2016, we self-reported the errors and possible irregularities related to our Belleli EPC business to the SEC. Since then, we have been cooperating with the SEC in its investigation of this matter. The SEC\u2019s investigation related to the circumstances giving rise to the restatement is continuing, and we are presently unable to predict the duration, scope or results or whether the SEC will commence any legal action. If we are found to have violated securities laws or other federal statutes, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, including, but not limited to injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil and criminal fines and penalties, modifications to business practices including the termination or modification of existing business relationships, modifications of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance. The imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and stock price.\nThe termination of or any price reductions under certain of our contract operations services contracts could have a material impact on our business.\nThe termination of or a demand by our customers to reduce prices under certain of our contract operations services contracts may lead to a reduction in our revenues and net income, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may be unable to renew, or enter into new, contracts with customers on favorable commercial terms, if at all. To the extent we are unable to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on terms that are favorable to us or to successfully manage our overall contract mix over time, our business, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nProduct sales backlog may be subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations.\nThe expected future revenues reflected in our product sales backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. Due to potential project cancellations or changes in project scope and schedule, we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be performed. In addition, even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that contracted parties may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us or poor project performance could increase the cost associated with a project. Delays, suspensions, cancellations, payment defaults, scope changes and poor project execution could materially reduce the revenues and reduce or eliminate profits that we actually realize from projects in backlog. We may be at greater risk of delays, suspensions and cancellations during periods of low oil and natural gas prices.\nReductions in our product sales backlog due to cancellation or modification by a customer or for other reasons may adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog. Contracts in our product sales backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event customers cancel projects. These cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out-of-pocket costs, revenues for work performed prior to cancellation and a varying percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed. However, we typically have no contractual right upon cancellation to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. Projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments to contracts reflected in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, litigation and other proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us, requiring material future cash payments or charges, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to various claims, both in litigation and binding arbitration proceedings. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to various claims, which, if not resolved within amounts we have accrued, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, any claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nWe depend on particular suppliers and may be vulnerable to product shortages and price increases.\nSome of the components used in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks, including price increases, quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner. Additionally, we occasionally experience long lead times from our sources for major components and may at times make purchases in anticipation of future business. We do not have long-term contracts with some of these sources, and the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a negative impact on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships. Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe face significant competitive pressures that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance.\nOur businesses face intense competition and have low barriers to entry. Our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to technological changes within our industry and changes in economic and market conditions and more readily take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities. Our ability to renew or replace existing contract operations services contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products, equipment or services or substantially decrease the price at which they offer their products, equipment or services, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nIn addition, we could face significant competition from new entrants into the compression services and product sales businesses. Some of our existing competitors or new entrants may expand or develop new processing, treating and compression equipment that would create additional competition for the products, equipment or services we provide to our customers.\nOur ability to manage and grow our business effectively may be adversely affected if we lose management or operational personnel.\nWe believe that our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be challenging and important. The supply of experienced operational and field personnel, in particular, decreases as other energy and manufacturing companies\u2019 needs for the same personnel increase. Our ability to grow and to continue our current level of service to our customers will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully hire, train and retain these important personnel.\nOur employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm.\nSafety is a leading focus of our business, and our safety record is critical to our reputation and is of paramount importance to our employees, customers and stockholders. However, we often work on large-scale and complex projects which can place our employees and others near large mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, dangerous processes and in challenging environments. Although we have a functional group whose primary purpose is to implement effective quality, health, safety, environmental and security procedures throughout our company, if we fail to implement effective safety procedures, our employees and others may become injured, disabled or lose their lives, our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations.\nUnsafe conditions at project work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase project costs and raise our operating costs. Additionally, many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability, or lost project awards or customers. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nOur operations entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures and natural disasters, which could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. These risks may expose us, as an equipment operator and developer, to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. The insurance we carry against many of these risks may not be adequate to cover our claims or losses. In addition, we are substantially self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation, employer\u2019s liability, property, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe may be subject to risks arising from changes in technology.\nThe supply chains in which we operate are subject to technological changes and changes in customer requirements. We may not successfully develop or implement new or modified types of products or technologies that may be required by our customers in the future. Further, the development of new technologies by competitors that may compete with our technologies could reduce demand for our products and affect our financial performance. Should we not be able to maintain or enhance the competitive values of our products or develop and introduce new products or technologies successfully, or if new products or technologies fail to generate sufficient revenues to offset research and development costs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur information technology infrastructure could be subject to service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, which could result in the disruption of operations or the loss of data confidentiality.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet and third-party service providers, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, collection, communication with our employees, customers, suppliers, dealers and suppliers, business acquisitions and other corporate transactions, compliance with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, and research and development. These information technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components, power outages, hardware failures or computer viruses. While we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, if these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Further, we cannot ensure we have insurance coverages to cover these issues.\nIn addition, information technology security threats and sophisticated cyber-based attacks, including, but not limited to, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, worms, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, or physical breaches, may cause deliberate or unintentional damage, destruction or misuse, manipulation, denial of access to or disclosure of confidential or important information by our employees, suppliers or third-party service providers. Additionally, advanced persistent attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems and those of third-party service providers we rely on are increasing in sophistication and frequency. We have experienced attacks on our information technology systems and networks, and we expect to continue to confront attempts by hackers and other third parties to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks. These attacks to date have not resulted in unauthorized access to confidential information regarding our customers, suppliers or employees and have not had a material impact on our business. However, we could in the future experience attacks that materially disrupt our business or result in access to such confidential information about our customers, suppliers and employees or material information about our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe are continuously developing and enhancing our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. This continued development and enhancement will require us to expend additional resources, including to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities that may be detected. Despite our ongoing investments in security resources, talent, and business practices, we are unable to assure that these enhanced security measures will be effective.\nWe can provide no assurance that our efforts to actively manage technology risks potentially affecting our systems and networks will be successful in eliminating or mitigating risks to our systems, networks and data or in effectively resolving such risks when they materialize. A failure of or breach in information technology security of our own systems, or those of our third-party suppliers, could expose us and our employees, customers, dealers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. Any of these events in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, including loss of customers and revenue, business, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability, as well as the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.\nTo conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national and state borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of E.U. law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, became effective in May 2018. Other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders and various states are enacting additional data laws that may impact us. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nWe are subject to a variety of governmental regulations; failure to comply with these regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to, for example, export controls, currency exchange, labor and employment and taxation. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. From time to time, as part of our operations we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities in the various countries in which we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance, any of which may have a negative impact on our financial condition, profitability and results of operations.\nOur international operations require us to comply with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and anti-corruption. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage.\nWe operate in many parts of the world that experience high levels of corruption, and our business brings us in frequent contact with foreign officials. Our compliance policies and programs mandate compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance. Our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents. If we undergo an investigation of potential violations of anti-corruption laws or if we fail to comply with these laws, we may incur significant legal expenses or be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other sanctions and remedial measures, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe also are subject to other laws and regulations governing our operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons and customs requirements. Trade control laws are complex and constantly changing. Our compliance policies and programs increase our cost of doing business and may not work effectively to ensure our compliance with trade control laws. If we undergo an investigation of potential violations of trade control laws by U.S. or foreign authorities or if we fail to comply with these laws, we may incur significant legal expenses or be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other sanctions and remedial measures, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in locations throughout the U.S. and internationally and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governments. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. In addition, U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Moreover, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. Changes to our tax positions resulting from tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges from taxing authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nU.S. federal, state, local and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells, and adversely affect demand for our products.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil, from dense subsurface rock formations. We do not perform hydraulic fracturing, but many of our customers do. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state agencies, but recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, and proposals have been made to enact separate U.S. federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.\nFor example, at the U.S. federal level, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act, and proposed regulations under the CWA governing wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations. On March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) released a final rule that updates existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on U.S. federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water. The final rule never went into effect due to pending litigation and on December 28, 2017, the BLM announced that it had rescinded the 2015 final rule, in part citing a review that found that each of the 32 states with federal oil and gas leases has regulations that already address hydraulic fracturing.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of, or prohibiting the performance of, drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. In addition, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict oil and natural-gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing in particular. For example, in 2018, Colorado voters ultimately rejected Proposition 112, a Colorado ballot initiative that would have drastically limited the use of hydraulic fracturing in Colorado. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. In countries outside of the U.S., including provincial, regional, tribal or local jurisdictions therein where we conduct operations, there may exist similar governmental restrictions or controls on our customers\u2019 hydraulic fracturing activities, which, if such restrictions or controls exist or are adopted in the future, our foreign customers may face the same challenges as our U.S. customers. Any such restrictions, domestically or foreign, could reduce demand for our products, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers\u2019 inability to acquire adequate supplies of water or dispose of or recycle the water used in operations, could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells, and adversely affect demand for our products.\nOil and gas development activities require the use of water. For example, the hydraulic fracturing process to produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas from many reservoirs requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain areas, there may be a scarcity of water for drilling activities due to various factors, including insufficient local aquifer capacity or government regulations restricting the use of water. Our customers\u2019 inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle the water used in operations, could adversely impact our or our customers\u2019 operations in certain areas. The imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations, could further restrict our customers\u2019 ability to conduct certain operations disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. Any such restrictions could reduce demand for our products, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the environment, and worker health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance. Certain of these laws also may impose joint and several and strict liability for environmental contamination, which may render us liable for remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that may have been lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior owners or operators or other third parties. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and costs associated with new information, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could negatively impact our financial condition, profitability and results of operations.\nWe may need to apply for or amend facility permits or licenses from time to time with respect to storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling, or air emissions relating to manufacturing activities or equipment operations, which subjects us to new or revised permitting conditions. These permits and authorizations may contain numerous compliance requirements, including monitoring and reporting obligations and operational restrictions, such as emission limits, which may be onerous or costly to comply with. Given the large number of facilities in which we operate, and the numerous environmental permits and other authorizations that are applicable to our operations, we may occasionally identify or be notified of technical violations of certain requirements existing in various permits or other authorizations. Occasionally, we have been assessed penalties for our non-compliance, and we could be subject to such penalties in the future.\nThe modification or interpretation of existing environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production, gathering and pipeline companies, including our customers, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.\nGlobal climate change is an increased international concern and could increase operating costs or reduce the demand for our products and services.\nContinuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions, such as cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. For example, in December 2015, the U.S. joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and represent a progression in their intended greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. While the U.S. announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, several U.S. state and local governments and major corporations headquartered in the U.S. announced an intent to honor the U.S.\u2019s commitments. Several U.S. cities, counties and state governments have also filed lawsuits against certain oil and gas companies seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts. To date, none of these suits has been successful, and we are not a party to these proceedings. In the U.S., the EPA has also begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the federal Clean Air Act and regulatory agencies and legislative bodies in other countries where we operate have adopted greenhouse gas emission reduction programs. The adoption of new or more stringent legislation or regulatory programs restricting greenhouse gas emissions in any of the jurisdictions where we or our customers operate could require us to incur higher operating costs or increase the cost of, and thus reduce the demand for, the hydrocarbon products of our customers. These increased costs or reduced demand could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability or results of operations.\nFurther, some scientists have concluded that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere may produce physical effects, such as increased severity and frequency of storms, droughts, floods and other climate events. To the extent there are significant changes in the Earth\u2019s climate in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be materially impacted, and demand for our products and services could fall. Demand for our products and services may also be adversely affected by conservation plans and efforts undertaken in response to global climate change. Many governments also provide, or may in the future provide, tax advantages and other subsidies to support the use and development of alternative energy technologies. Our operations and the demand for our products and services or our customers\u2019 products could be materially impacted by the development and adoption of these technologies.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for companies engaged in business involving fossil fuels, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, investment funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. This could make it more difficult for our customers to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream energy business activities.\nRisks Related to Our Level of Indebtedness\nOur outstanding debt obligations could limit our ability to fund future growth and operations and increase our exposure to risk during adverse economic conditions.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had a long-term debt balance of $403.8 million. Many factors, including factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness. These factors include those discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors and those listed in the Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section included in Part I of this Annual report.\nOur debt and associated commitments could have important adverse consequences. For example, these commitments could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions or other corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because the interest payments on borrowings under our revolving credit facility are based upon variable interest rates and can adjust based upon certain financial covenant ratios;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or less restrictive covenants in such debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds in the future.\nCovenants in our debt agreements may restrict our ability to operate our business.\nOur credit agreement, consisting of a $700.0 million revolving credit facility expiring in October 2023, contains various covenants with which we, Exterran Energy Solutions, L.P. (\u201cEESLP\u201d), our wholly owned subsidiary, and our respective restricted subsidiaries must comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, liens on assets, repurchasing equity, making distributions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, dispositions of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. Additionally, we are required to maintain certain financial covenant ratios. If we fail to remain in compliance with these restrictions and financial covenants, we would be in default under our credit agreement. In addition, if we experience a material adverse effect on our assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations that, taken as a whole, impact our ability to perform our obligations under our credit agreement, this could lead to a default. A default under one of our debt agreements might trigger cross-default provisions under our other debt agreement, which would accelerate our obligation to repay our indebtedness under those agreements. If the repayment obligations on any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not be able to repay the debt or refinance the debt on acceptable terms, and our financial position would be materially adversely affected. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreement.\nAs a result of a covenant restriction included in our credit agreement, $578.4 million of the $608.3 million of undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facility was available for additional borrowings as of December 31, 2018.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect our results of operations.\nLIBOR and certain other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. In particular, on July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether, at that time, LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. As of December 31, 2018, $35.0 million of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility had interest rate payments determined directly or indirectly based on LIBOR. Any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the performance of LIBOR relative to its historic values. If the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, or if LIBOR ceases to perform as it has historically, our interest expense associated with our outstanding indebtedness or any future indebtedness we incur may increase. Further, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may be forced to substitute an alternative reference rate under our revolving credit facility or rely on base rate borrowings in lieu of LIBOR-based borrowings. At this point, it is not clear what, if any, alternative reference rate may replace LIBOR, however, any such alternative reference rate may increase the interest expense associated with our existing or future indebtedness. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our borrowing costs, business and results of operations.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial condition, may decrease our profitability or could dilute our shareholders.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, our shareholders\u2019 ownership in us would be diluted. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect our shareholders.\nRisks Related to the Spin-off\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax liabilities of Archrock.\nCertain tax liabilities of Archrock may become our obligations. Pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Archrock consolidated U.S. federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the Spin-off is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire Archrock consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Archrock that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Archrock consolidated tax reporting group between us and Archrock. If Archrock is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.\nOur prior and continuing relationship with Archrock exposes us to risks attributable to businesses of Archrock.\nArchrock is obligated to indemnify us for losses that third parties may seek to impose upon us or our affiliates for liabilities relating to the business of Archrock that are incurred through a breach of the separation and distribution agreement or any ancillary agreement by Archrock or its affiliates other than us, or losses that are attributable to Archrock in connection with the Spin-off or are not expressly assumed by us under our agreements with Archrock. Any claims made against us that are properly attributable to Archrock in accordance with these arrangements would require us to exercise our rights under our agreements with Archrock to obtain payment from Archrock. We are exposed to the risk that, in these circumstances, Archrock cannot, or will not, make the required payment.\nIn connection with our separation from Archrock, Archrock will indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we will indemnify Archrock for certain liabilities. If we are required to act on these indemnities to Archrock, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, and our financial results could be negatively impacted. In the case of Archrock\u2019s indemnity, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or as to Archrock\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and other agreements with Archrock, Archrock has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify Archrock for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Under the separation and distribution agreement, we and Archrock will generally release the other party from all claims arising prior to the Spin-off that relate to the other party\u2019s business, subject to certain exceptions. Also pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, we have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to remove Archrock as a party to certain of our contracts with third parties. In the event that Archrock remains as a party, we expect to indemnify Archrock for any liabilities relating to such contracts. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Archrock will not be subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Spin-off.\nWith respect to Archrock\u2019s agreement to indemnify us, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Archrock will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Archrock will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Archrock any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and stock market conditions;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;\n\u2022\nchanges in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks or terrorist acts;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives.\nThese broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternate forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, in each case, as amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. This forum selection provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable or cost-effective for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.", "PERMNO": 15710, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "EXTN"}
