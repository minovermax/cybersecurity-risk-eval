RISK FACTORS\nWe face a number of material risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and significant risk and market disruption remain as the public health crisis continues. While we describe risks stemming from operating in the COVID-19 economic environment separately from each of the other risks we identify as material, a number of the risks described are interrelated, and certain of these risks could trigger effects of other risks described below. Also, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we do not currently consider to be material, could also potentially impair and/or have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Economic and Market Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and financial results, and the ultimate impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created extensive disruptions to the global economy and to the lives of individuals throughout the world, and will likely continue to have an impact for at least the near term. The pandemic and related efforts to contain it have disrupted global economic activity, adversely affected the functioning of financial markets, impacted interest rates, increased economic and market uncertainty, and disrupted trade, supply chains and the labor market. During the past two years, governments, businesses, and the public have taken unprecedented actions to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus packages, vaccine and mask mandates, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. At present, most restrictions on movement have been lifted and widely available vaccines have proved to be effective in minimizing serious illness or death from the novel coronavirus; however, the emergence of new variants of the virus have impeded the ability to fully resolve the public health risk and, as such, disruption of typical social and economic conditions persists. The scope, duration, and full effects of COVID-19 continue to evolve and are not yet fully known. If these effects continue for a prolonged period, it could result in sustained economic stress or recession, and such effects could have a material adverse impact on us in a number of ways related to credit, collateral, customer demand, funding, operations, interest rate risk, liquidity and litigation, as described in more detail below.\nCredit Risk. Timely loan repayment and the value of collateral supporting our loans are affected by the strength of our borrowers\u2019 businesses. The continuation of the COVID-19 public health crisis has constrained and is likely to continue to constrain commercial activity and financial transactions. At present, labor shortages and supply chain interruptions continue to present obstacles to economic recovery and have contributed to inflationary conditions. These conditions have and are expected to continue to result in overall economic and financial market instability and affect businesses\u2019 profitability and individuals\u2019 purchasing power, all of which may cause our customers to be unable to make scheduled loan payments. If the economic effects of COVID-19 result in widespread and sustained repayment shortfalls on loans in our portfolio, we could incur significant delinquencies, foreclosures and credit losses, particularly if the available collateral is insufficient to cover our exposure. The future effects of COVID-19 on economic activity could negatively affect the collateral values associated with our existing loans, the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our residential and commercial real estate loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing, the future demand for or profitability of our lending and services, and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers. Further, in the event of delinquencies, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making business decisions in response to such delinquencies or may result in a delay in taking certain remediation actions, such as foreclosure. In addition, we have unfunded commitments to extend credit to customers that could pose additional credit risk in an economic downturn. Furthermore, in an effort to support our communities during the pandemic, we participated in the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) under the CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, whereby loans to small businesses are originated. These loans require forbearance of loan payments for a specified time and also limit our ability to pursue all available remedies in the event of a loan default. If the borrower fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, or if the SBA determines there is a deficiency in the manner in which any PPP loans were originated, funded or serviced by the Bank, we are subject to repayment risk as well as the heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates as compared to loans to customers that we would have otherwise extended credit.\nStrategic Risk. Our financial condition and results of operations may be affected by a variety of external factors, such as economic conditions, labor shortages, and the various responses of governmental and nongovernmental authorities to economic instability. These and other factors may impact the price or marketability of our products and services, cause changes in interest rates that may reduce our earnings and/or increase our funding costs, reduce demand for our financial products, or impact our ability to implement strategic initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has led to severe disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. Furthermore, many of the governmental actions in response to the pandemic were directed toward curtailing household and business activity to contain COVID-19. The future effects of COVID-19 on economic activity could negatively affect the future banking products we provide, including the level of our loan originations.\nOperational Risk. If restrictions are reinstituted that affect our workforce\u2019s access to our facilities, it could limit our ability to meet customer servicing expectations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, quarantines and health concerns have continued to result in a larger percentage of associates working remotely when compared to pre-pandemic levels. We rely on business processes and branch activity that largely depend on people and technology, including access to information technology systems as well as information, applications, payment systems and other services provided by third parties. Technology in employees\u2019 homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the employees\u2019 access to the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to employees to be more limited or less reliable to them than in our offices. The continuation of work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including a small measure of increased cybersecurity risk. These cyber risks include slightly greater phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations, increased risk of\nunauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers.\nMoreover, we rely on many third parties in our business operations, including the appraiser of the real property collateral, vendors that supply essential services such as loan servicers, providers of financial information, systems and analytical tools and providers of electronic payment and settlement systems, and local and federal government agencies, offices, and courthouses. These entities may limit the availability and access of their services due to the pandemic and related labor shortages. For example, loan origination could be delayed due to the limited availability of real estate appraisers for the collateral. Loan closings could be delayed due to staff reductions in recording offices or the closing of courthouses in certain counties or parishes, which slows the process for title work, mortgage and UCC filings in those counties or parishes. If our third-party service providers continue to have limited capacities for a prolonged period or if additional limitations or potential disruptions in these services materialize, it may negatively affect our operations.\nFurther, we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating credit losses, grading loans and extending credit, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations. Our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may be incorrect, particularly in times of market distress or volatility, as we have experienced and expect to continue to experience as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant. As a result, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we operate. If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management or other business or financial decisions. Furthermore, strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable, and as a result, we may realize losses or other lapses.\nInterest Rate Risk. Our net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability are and are likely to continue to be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent in response to the economic disruption that occurred at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has continued into 2022. The prolonged period of low interest rates has and is expected to continue to cause downward pressure on our net interest margin, including reduced yield on our variable rate loans and on new loans, and realized yields on investments securities. However, we expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates more than once in the next twelve months. Increasing interest rates can have a negative impact on our business by reducing the amount of money our customers borrow or by adversely affecting their ability to repay outstanding loan balances that may increase due to adjustments in their variable rates. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment we may have to offer more attractive interest rates to depositors to compete for deposits, or pursue other sources of liquidity, such as wholesale funds. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could result in a decrease in net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates impacts both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, or financial condition. A prolonged period of volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies.\nWe have ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates and actively manage these risks through hedging and other risk mitigation strategies. However, if our assumptions are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than anticipated, our risk mitigation techniques may be ineffective or costly.\nBecause there have been no comparable recent global pandemics that resulted in a similar global impact, we do not yet know the full extent of and the long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business, operations, or the global economy as a whole. Any future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of our work from home arrangements, third party providers\u2019 ability to support our operations, and any actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. The uncertainty surrounding this crisis has and could continue to materially and adversely affect our business, operations, operating results, financial condition, liquidity or capital levels.\nLiquidity and Litigation Risk. Federal, state and local governments have mandated or encouraged financial services companies to make accommodations to borrowers and other customers financially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Legal and regulatory responses to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business. The Company instituted a program to assist customers financially impacted by COVID-19, including temporary waivers of certain fees and charges and payment deferment and other loan relief, as appropriate. The Company has also granted certain longer-term loan modifications for customers financially impacted by COVID-19. If these deferrals and modifications are not effective in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s customers, it may adversely affect its business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time.\nSince the inception of the PPP, we and other banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP and some banks have received negative media attention associated with the PPP. The Company and the Bank could be exposed to additional litigation risk and to negative media attention. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation or negative media attention could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe PPP has also attracted interest from federal and state enforcement authorities, oversight agencies, regulators and Congressional committees. State attorneys general and other federal and state agencies may assert that they are not subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and the PPP regulations entitling the Bank to rely on borrower certifications, and they may take more aggressive actions against the Bank for alleged violations of the provisions governing the Bank\u2019s participation in the PPP. Federal and state regulators can impose or request that we consent to substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements if they determine there are violations of laws, rules or regulations or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe may be vulnerable to certain sectors of the economy and to economic conditions both generally and locally across the specific markets in which we operate.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by macroeconomic factors that affect the U.S. economy. Unfavorable economic conditions, particularly in the Gulf South region, could significantly affect the demand for our loans and other products, the ability of borrowers to repay loans, and the value of collateral securing loans.\nVolatility in global financial markets may have a spillover effect that would ultimately impair the performance of the U.S. economy and, in turn, our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to lending concentration risk.\nOur loan portfolio contains several industry, collateral and other concentrations including, but not limited to, commercial and residential real estate, healthcare, hospitality, shared national credits, leveraged loans and energy. Due to the exposure in these concentrations, disruptions in markets, economic conditions, including those resulting from the global response to COVID-19, changes in laws or regulations or other events could significantly impact the ability of our borrowers to repay and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. In weak economies, or in areas where real estate market conditions are distressed, we may experience a higher than normal level of nonperforming real estate loans. The collateral value of the portfolio and the revenue stream from those loans could come under stress, and additional provisions for the allowance for credit losses could be necessitated. Our ability to dispose of foreclosed real estate at prices at or above the respective carrying values could also be impaired, causing additional losses.\nCertain changes in interest rates, mortgage origination, inflation, or the financial markets could affect our results of operations, demand for our products and our ability to deliver products efficiently.\nOur assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature and we are subject to significant risks tied to changes in interest rates that are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Inflation can influence the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting level of capitalization. Inflation also affects the level of market interest rates, and therefore, the pricing of financial instruments. We believe the most significant potential impact of inflation on our financial results is our ability to manage the impact of changes in interest rates. Further, an increase in inflation could cause our operating costs related to salaries and benefits, technology and supplies to increase at a faster pace than revenues.\nOur ability to operate profitably is largely dependent upon net interest income. Net interest income is the primary component of our earnings and is affected by both local external factors such as economic conditions in the Gulf South and local competition for loans and deposits, as well as broader influences, such as federal monetary policy and market interest rates. Unexpected movement in interest rates markedly changing the slope of the current yield curve could cause our net interest margins to decrease, subsequently reducing net interest income. In addition, such changes could adversely affect the valuation of our assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, loan originations, and potentially loan revenues, could be adversely impacted by sharply rising interest rates. If market rates of interest increase, it would increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers; adversely affect those borrowers\u2019 ability to pay as contractually obligated; potentially reduce loan demand or result in additional delinquencies or charge-offs; and increase the cost of our deposits, which are a primary source of funding.\nThe fair market value of our securities portfolio and the investment income from these securities also fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.\nAn underperforming stock market could adversely affect wealth management fees associated with managed securities portfolios and could also reduce brokerage transactions, therefore reducing investment brokerage revenues.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented an effective asset and liability management strategy to manage the potential effects of changes in interest rates, including the use of adjustable rate and/or short-term assets, and FHLB advances or longer term repurchase agreements, any substantial, unexpected change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operation and our strategies may not always be successful in managing the risk associated with changes in interest rates.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect our profitability.\nInterest rates and our financial performance are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve include open market transactions in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, we cannot predict the potential impact of future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, and loan demand on our business and earnings. Furthermore, the actions of the U.S. government and other governments may result in currency fluctuations, exchange controls, market disruption, material decreases in the values of certain of our financial assets and other adverse effects.\nThe Federal Reserve reduced rates to near zero in March 2020 in response to economic disruption that occurred at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has continued into 2022. The prolonged period of low interest rates has and is expected to continue to cause downward pressure on our net interest margin, including reduced yield on our variable rate loans and on new loans, and realized yields on investments securities. Further rate changes are dependent on the Federal Reserve\u2019s assessment of economic data as it becomes available. We expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates more than once in the next twelve months. Historically, when the Federal Reserve Board increases the Fed Funds rate, overall interest rates have also risen, which may negatively impact the U.S. economy, and could have a negative impact on our business by reducing the amount of money our customers borrow or by adversely affecting their ability to repay outstanding loan balances that may increase due to adjustments in their variable rates. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment we may have to offer more attractive interest rates to depositors to compete for deposits, or pursue other sources of liquidity, such as wholesale funds. Further, when interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in net interest income.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence (i) the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities, (ii) the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, (iii) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (iv) the fair value of our assets and liabilities, and (v) the reinvestment risk associated with changes in the duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company's control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent changes and potential for additional changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that the Company's customers import or export, including among others, agricultural products, could cause the prices of our customers' products to increase, could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt.\nIn addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on the Company or on the markets in which the Company operates its business, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.\nThe financial soundness and stability of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and financial soundness and stability of other financial institutions as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships with such institutions. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, and even rumors regarding, other financial institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could impair our ability to effect such transactions and could lead to losses or defaults by us. In addition, a number of our transactions\nexpose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. Additionally, our credit risk may be increased if the collateral we hold in connection with such transactions cannot be realized or can only be liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to cover the full amount of our financial exposure. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on its intention to extend the retirement date of certain offered rates whereby the publication of the one week and two month LIBOR offered rates will cease after December 31, 2021; but, the publication of the remaining LIBOR offered rates will continue until June 30, 2023.The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has published recommended alternative rates for certain financial instruments currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently considering industry wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. On July 29, 2021, ARCC formally recommended SOFR as its preferred alternative replacement rate for LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nUpon the cessation of the use of LIBOR, interest rates on our floating rate obligations, loans, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. In addition, the cessation of the use of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates.\nA substantial portion of our variable rate loans, along with certain derivative and other financial instruments, are indexed to LIBOR. While the majority of these instruments contain either provisions for the designation of an alternate benchmark rate or \u201cfallback\u201d provisions providing for alternative rate calculations in the event LIBOR is unavailable, not all of our loans, derivatives or financial instruments contain such provisions, and the existing provisions and/or recent modifications to our documents to address transition may not adequately address the actual changes to LIBOR or the financial impact of successor benchmark rates. We may not be able to successfully amend these loans, derivatives and financial instruments to provide for alternative benchmarks or alternative rate calculations and such amendments could prove costly and may impact our ability to maintain hedge accounting treatment on certain cash flow hedges. Even with provisions allowing for designation of alternative benchmarks or \u201cfallback\u201d provisions, the discontinuance of LIBOR could result in customer uncertainty and disputes arising as a consequence of the transition from LIBOR. All of this could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customers and additional costs to us, all of which could be material.\nTax law and regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to tax laws, including a repeal of all or part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, could significantly impact our business in the form of greater than expected income tax expense and taxes payable. Such changes may also negatively impact the financial condition of our customers and/or overall economic conditions. Further, we expect the current administration to seek to implement reforms that could include a heightened focus and scrutiny on BSA/AML-related compliance, expansion of consumer protections, the regulation of loan portfolios and credit concentrations to borrowers impacted by climate change, increased capital and liquidity requirements and limitations on share repurchases and dividends, all of which could increase our costs and impact our business.\nGovernmental responses to market disruptions and other events may be inadequate and may have unintended consequences.\nCongress and financial regulators may implement measures designed to stabilize financial markets in periods of disruption, including in reaction to the financial impact of COVID-19 and inflation. The overall impact of these efforts on the financial markets may be ineffective and could adversely affect our business.\nWe compete with a number of financial services companies that are not subject to the same degree of regulatory oversight. The impact of the existing regulatory framework and any future changes to it could negatively affect our ability to compete with these institutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects.\nWe may need to rely on the financial markets to provide needed capital.\nOur common stock is listed and traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. If our capital resources are inadequate to meet our capital requirements in the future, we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital. If conditions in the capital markets are not\nfavorable, we may be constrained in raising capital. We maintain a consistent analyst following; therefore, downgrades in our prospects by one or more of our analysts may cause our stock price to fall and significantly limit our ability to access the markets for additional capital requirements. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when and if needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that we, our affiliates and/or our securities receive from recognized rating agencies. Our credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and some factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally, and remain subject to change at any time. A downgrade to the credit rating of us or our affiliates could affect our ability to access the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs and negatively impact our profitability. A downgrade to us, our affiliates or our securities could create obligations or liabilities under the terms of our outstanding securities that could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, a downgrade to the credit rating of any particular security issued by us or our affiliates could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.\nBecause our decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. In addition, geopolitical and worldwide market conditions may cause disruption or volatility in the U.S. equity and debt markets, which could hinder our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the future on favorable terms.\nRisks Related to the Financial Services Industry\nWe must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to support our operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as to meet regulatory requirements. Our access to sources of liquidity in amounts adequate to fund our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include an economic downturn that affects the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated, or any material deterioration of the credit markets. Our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors and the loss of deposits to alternative investments. Although we have historically been successful in replacing maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we might not be able to duplicate that success in the future, especially if a large number of our depositors were to withdraw their amounts on deposit. A failure to maintain an adequate level of liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, liquidity in excess of current demand or operating needs may result in lower-earning assets that may adversely affect our results of operation.\nGreater loan losses than expected may adversely affect our earnings.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit risk is inherent in our business and any material level of credit failure could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our credit risk with respect to our real estate and construction loan portfolio relates principally to the creditworthiness of our corporate borrowers and the value of the real estate pledged as security for the repayment of loans. Our credit risk with respect to our commercial and consumer loan portfolio will depend on the general creditworthiness of businesses and individuals within our local markets. Our credit risk with respect to our energy loan portfolio is subject to commodity pricing that is determined by factors outside of our control.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for estimated loan losses based on a number of factors. This process requires subjective and complex judgments, including analysis of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. If our assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses. We may have to increase our allowance in the future in response to the request of one of our primary banking regulators, to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions, to adjust for changes in resolution strategies, or as a result of any deterioration in the quality of our loan and lease portfolio. Losses in excess of the existing allowance or any provisions for loan losses taken to increase the allowance will reduce our net income and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future provisions for loan losses may vary materially from the amounts of past provisions.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d commonly referred to as Current Expected Credit Losses, or CECL. Under CECL, entities are required to recognize at the reporting date the full amount of expected credit losses for the lifetime of the financial assets, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While the standard does not impact actual losses, it does accelerate the timing of the recognition of expected losses and adds additional uncertainty and potential volatility with added length of forecast period and additional assumptions such as prepayment speeds and funding of lending\ncommitments not previously impacting the allowance. Changes in forecast assumptions may result in an unfavorable impact to our results of operations and our capital level.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we rely in substantial part on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors if made available. If this information is inaccurate, we may be subject to loan defaults, financial losses, regulatory action, reputational harm or other adverse effects with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks in connection with any sale of loans we may conduct.\nFrom time to time we may sell all or a portion of one of more loan portfolios, and in connection therewith we may make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser concerning the loans sold and the procedures under which those loans have been originated and serviced. If any of these representations and warranties are incorrect, we may be required to indemnify the purchaser for any related losses, or we may be required to repurchase part or all of the affected loans. We may also be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default by the borrower on a loan we have sold. If we are required to make any indemnity payments or repurchases and do not have a remedy available to us against a solvent counterparty to the loan or loans, we may not be able to recover our losses resulting from these indemnity payments and repurchases. Consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause financial losses.\nOur ability to adequately conduct and grow our business is dependent on our ability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizational control infrastructure. Operational risk can arise in numerous ways including employee fraud, theft or malfeasance; customer fraud; and control lapses in bank operations and information technology. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors in processing or recording transactions appropriately may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered. We have recently and plan to continue to make investments in new technologies for sales and service, including mobile and online banking, as well as teller, customer service and loan origination platforms. These new technologies and/or operational changes may lead to increased operational risk. Our dependence on our employees and automated systems, including the automated systems used by acquired entities and third parties, to record and process transactions may further increase the risk that technical failures or tampering of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We are also subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. In addition, products, services and processes are continually changing and we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Failure to maintain an appropriate operational infrastructure can lead to loss of service to customers, additional expenditures related to the detection and correction of operational failures, reputational damage and loss of customer confidence, legal actions, and noncompliance with various laws and regulations.\nWe continuously monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements when we believe it to be appropriate to do so. However, there are inherent limits to such capabilities. In some instances, we may build and maintain these capabilities ourselves. We also outsource some of these functions to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. Third parties may fail to properly perform services or comply with applicable laws and regulations, and replacing third party providers could entail significant delay and expense. We also face risk from the integration of new infrastructure platforms and/or new third party providers of such platforms into existing businesses.\nOur operational and communications systems and infrastructure may fail or may be the subject of a breach or cyber-attack that, if successful, could adversely affect our business and disrupt business continuity.\nWe depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of client transactions and to communicate with clients and other institutions on a continuous basis. Our clients depend on us for access to their assets and account information.\nOur online, business, financial, accounting, data processing, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be sudden increases in client transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, and hurricanes; pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters,\nincluding terrorist acts; occurrences of employee error, fraud, or malfeasance; and, as described below, cyber-attacks. Furthermore, for most financial institutions, transitioning from existing systems and software (or transitioning legacy systems and software) to a new provider is a significant and expensive undertaking and includes a number of risks, including crashes and system downtime, transition costs, decreased productivity, security risk, and legal and regulatory compliance risks.\nAlthough we have response plans, business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our operations and communications may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and infrastructure that support our businesses and clients. While we continue to evolve and modify our response and business continuity plans, there can be no assurance in an escalating threat environment that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts. Our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us or the industry.\nSecurity risks for financial institutions such as ours have dramatically increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication, resources and activities of hackers, terrorists, activists, organized crime, and other external parties, including nation state actors. In addition, clients may use devices or software to access our products and services that are beyond our control environment, which may provide additional avenues for attackers to gain access to confidential information. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, certain of our technologies, systems, networks, and clients\u2019 devices and software have in the past and in the future likely will continue to be the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, use, loss, change or destruction of our or our clients\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information (including personal identifying information of individuals), or otherwise disrupt our or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. From time to time, we, like other financial institutions, become aware of information security vulnerabilities in software emanating from outside vendors and must take active steps to mitigate and prevent the potential exploitation of such vulnerabilities. Further, U.S. financial institutions and financial services companies will continue to face breaches in security of their websites or other systems, including attempts to shut down access to their networks and systems in an attempt to extract compensation from them to regain control. Financial institutions have also experienced, and will continue to be the target of, distributed denial-of-service attacks, a sophisticated and targeted attack intended to disable or degrade internet service or to sabotage systems.\nWe and others in our industry are, and will continue to be, regularly the subject of attempts by attackers to gain unauthorized access to our networks, systems, data and other infrastructure, or to obtain, change, or destroy confidential data (including personal identifying information of individuals) through a variety of means, including computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, computer viruses or other malicious codes, phishing, employee error or malfeasance, catastrophes, unforeseen events or other cyber-attacks. In the future, these attacks may result in unauthorized individuals obtaining access to our confidential information or that of our clients, or otherwise accessing, damaging, or disrupting our systems or infrastructure. The higher instance of remote work on the part of our associates and our customers in response to COVID-19 has heightened these risks.\nTo date, we have seen no material adverse impact on our business or operations from cyber-attacks or events. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data, could result in significant disruption of our operations, reimbursement and other costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits and other legal exposure, a loss of trust in us on the part of our clients, vendors or other counterparties, client attrition and damage to our reputation. Any of these could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial condition, and/or our share price. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies we acquire. We are continuously enhancing our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our networks, systems, data and other infrastructure from attack, damage or unauthorized access. This continued enhancement will require us to expend additional resources, including to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities that may be detected. Despite our ongoing investments in security resources, talent, and business practices, there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data.\nWe, or third-parties from whom we license critical information technology systems, may be alleged to have infringed upon intellectual property rights owned by others.\nCompetitors or other third parties may allege that we, or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us or from whom we license critical information technology systems, infringe on their intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, an assertion of an infringement claim against us or our vendors may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim (even if we ultimately prevail); to pay significant money damages; to lose significant revenues; to be prohibited from using the relevant systems, processes, technologies or other intellectual property; to cease offering certain products or services or to incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses. Moreover, it has become common in recent years for individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours. Even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the\ndiversion of time and attention of our management and employees. In addition, although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs, such indemnifying party may refuse, or be unable, to uphold its contractual obligations.\nEmployee misconduct could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nWe are vulnerable to reputational harm because we operate in an industry in which integrity and the confidence of our customers are of critical importance. Our employees could engage in fraudulent, illegal, wrongful or suspicious activities, improper use or disclosure of confidential information and/or activities resulting in consumer harm that adversely affects our customers and/or our business. The precautions we take to detect and prevent such misconduct may not always be effective, and we may be exposed to regulatory sanctions and/or penalties, and serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships and ability to attract new customers.\nReturns on pension plan assets may not be adequate to cover future funding requirements.\nInvestments in the portfolio of our defined benefit pension plan may not provide adequate returns to fully fund benefits as they come due, thus causing higher annual plan expenses and requiring additional contributions by us to the defined benefit pension plan.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nA significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate our taking charges in the future to reflect an impairment of our goodwill. Future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment.\nAdverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of our intangible assets including significant loss of core deposits, customer relationships acquired in our trust and asset management transaction, losses of acquired credit card accounts and/or balances, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent these intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, a non-cash impairment charge would be recorded. While an impairment charge does not impact regulatory capital, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy\nWe are subject to industry competition which may have an impact upon our success.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully in a highly competitive market for banking and financial services, and we expect such challenges to continue. Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do. We face competition in our regional market areas from other commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, securities brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies, and other financial institutions that offer similar services. Some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive supervision and regulation to which we or the Bank are subject, and may accordingly have greater flexibility in competing for business. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by other firms. These developments could result in our competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, or being able to offer a broader range of products and services with more geographic range.\nSome of our competitors have reduced or eliminated certain service charges on deposit accounts, including overdraft fees, and additional competitors may be willing to reduce or eliminate service or other fees in order to attract additional customers. If the Company chooses to reduce or eliminate certain categories of fees, including those related to deposit accounts, fee income related to these products and services would be reduced. If the Company chooses not to take such actions, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in attracting customers for certain fee producing products.\nAnother competitive factor is that the financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, primarily as a result of the increased digitization of banking services, the demand for which was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We compete with many forms of payments offered by both bank and non-bank providers, including a variety of new and evolving alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products, such as aggregators and web-based and wireless payment platforms or technologies, digital or \u201ccrypto\u201d currencies, prepaid systems and payment services targeting users of social networks, communications platforms and online gaming. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to use technology competitively to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and create additional efficiencies in our operations. The widespread adoption of new technologies has and will continue to require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt our systems to remain competitive and offer new products and services. Our ability to effectively implement new technologies to improve our operations and systems will impact our competitive position in the financial services industry. Furthermore, we may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology, or those new products may not be accepted by customers.\nIf we are unable to successfully compete with traditional competitors as well as the evolving landscape of fintech companies and other nontraditional competitors to attract and retain customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations may also be adversely affected, perhaps materially. In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers desiring to do business with our competitors, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin.\nThe implementation of new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk.\nWe continuously evaluate our service offerings and may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business in the future. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. The development of new lines of business or new products and services often requires the commitment of significant resources that may not be recouped if not successful. Variables beyond our control or that we do not foresee may prevent the successful implementation of new lines of business, products or services. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could require the establishment of new key and other controls and have a significant impact on our existing system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits from our efficiency and growth initiatives, which could negatively impact our future profitability.\nOperating costs must decrease or grow at a slower pace than overall revenue in order to thrive in the competitive banking environment. We have and will continue to implement strategies to grow our loan portfolio and increase noninterest income in order to realize earnings growth and to remain competitive with the other banks in the markets we serve. We are continuously focused on growth initiatives and strategies for expense reductions to increase efficiencies. While we have had success in cost-savings and revenue growth in the past, there is no guarantee that these initiatives will be successful in the future. In addition, while expense control continues to be a top focus for us, management also expects to continue to make strategic investments in technology that are expected to improve our customer experience and support future growth, which will require an increase in expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will ultimately realize the anticipated benefits of our expense reduction and growth strategies, which may impair our earnings growth. Further, we may not be able to realize cost savings or revenue benefits in the time period expected, which could negatively affect our near-term profitability.\nOur future growth and financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to successfully execute our growth plans, which may include acquisitions and de novo branching.\nWe may not be able to continue our organic, or internal, growth, which depends upon economic conditions, our ability to identify appropriate markets for expansion, our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, our ability to fund growth at a reasonable cost, sufficient capital to support our growth initiatives, competitive factors, banking laws, and other factors.\nWe may seek to supplement our internal growth through acquisitions. We cannot predict the number, size or timing of acquisitions, or whether any such acquisition will occur at all. Our acquisition efforts have traditionally focused on targeted banking entities in markets in which we currently operate and markets in which we believe we can compete effectively. However, as consolidation of the financial services industry continues, the competition for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and, as the number of appropriate targets decreases, the prices for potential acquisitions could increase which could reduce our potential returns, and reduce the attractiveness of these opportunities to us. We may compete with other financial services companies for acquisition opportunities, and many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more for an acquisition than we are able or willing to pay.\nWe also may be required to use a substantial amount of our available cash and other liquid assets, or seek additional debt or equity financing, to fund future acquisitions. Such events could make us more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures, and additional debt service requirements may impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to locate suitable acquisition candidates willing to sell on terms acceptable to us, or we are otherwise unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing necessary for us to continue making acquisitions, we would be required to find other methods to grow our business and we may not grow at the same rate we have in the past, or at all.\nWe must generally satisfy several conditions, including receiving federal regulatory approval, in order execute most acquisition transactions. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and future prospects. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels; the competence, experience, and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution\u2019s record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act) and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering\nactivities. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. We may also be required to sell banks or branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition. Additionally, federal and/or state regulators may charge us with regulatory and compliance failures of an acquired business that occurred prior to the date of acquisition, and such failures may result in the imposition of formal or informal enforcement actions.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully consolidate any business or assets we acquire with our existing business. The integration of acquired operations and assets may require substantial management effort, time and resources and may divert management\u2019s focus from other strategic opportunities and operational matters. Acquisitions may not perform as expected when the transaction was consummated and may be dilutive to our overall operating results and stockholders\u2019 equity per share of common stock. Specifically, acquisitions could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees or other consequences that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees. We may also sell or consider selling one or more of our businesses. Such a sale would generally be subject to certain federal and/or state regulatory approvals, and may not be able to generate gains on sale or related increases in shareholder\u2019s equity commensurate with desirable levels.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, as opportunities arise, we may explore de novo branching as a part of our internal growth strategy and possibly enter into new markets through de novo branching. De novo branching and any acquisition carry numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs and anticipated operating losses associated with establishing a de novo branch or a new bank;\n\u2022\nthe inability to secure the services of qualified senior management;\n\u2022\nthe failure of the local market to accept the services of a new bank owned and managed by a bank holding company headquartered outside of the market area of the new bank;\n\u2022\neconomic downturns in the new market;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain attractive locations within a new market at a reasonable cost; and\n\u2022\nthe additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls.\nWe have experienced, to some extent, many of these risks with our de novo branching to date.\nChanges in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact our investments in bank premises, equipment, technology and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change our retail distribution channel.\nWe have significant investments in bank premises and equipment for our branch network. Advances in technology such as e-commerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including automated teller machines and other equipment, as well as an increasing customer preference for these other methods of accessing our products and services, could decrease the value of our branch network, technology, or other retail distribution physical assets and may cause us to change our retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce our remaining branches and work force. In 2021, the Company recorded $13.9 million in losses on facilities and equipment related to such consolidation. Similar actions in the future could lead to additional losses on disposition of such assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of any long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate, reconfigure or close a number of our remaining branches or to otherwise reform our retail distribution channel.\nRisks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal and state entities.\nWe are subject to the regulations of the Commission, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the CFPB and the MDBCF. New regulations issued by these or other agencies may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business activities. We are subject to various federal and state laws, and certain changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations. Other than the federal securities laws, the laws and regulations governing our business are intended primarily for the protection of our depositors, our customers, the financial system and the FDIC insurance fund, not our shareholders or other creditors. Further, we must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain activities, and our regulators have the ability to compel us to, or restrict us from, taking certain actions entirely, such as increasing dividends, entering into merger or acquisition transactions, acquiring or establishing new branches, and entering into certain new businesses. Noncompliance with certain of these regulations may impact our business plans, including our ability to branch, offer certain products, or execute existing or planned business strategies.\nFor additional information regarding laws and regulations to which our business is subject, see \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nAny of the laws or regulations to which we are subject, including tax laws, regulations or their interpretations, may be modified or changed from time to time, and we cannot be assured that such modifications or changes will not adversely affect us. Failure to appropriately comply with any such laws or regulations could result in sanctions by regulatory authorities, civil monetary penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs.\nWe and other financial institutions have been the subject of litigation, investigations and other proceedings which could result in legal liability and damage to our reputation.\nWe and certain of our directors, officers and subsidiaries may be named from time to time as defendants in various class actions and other litigation relating to our business and activities. Past, present and future litigation has included or could include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We are also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental, law enforcement and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business. These matters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, amendments and/or restatements of our Commission filings and/or financial statements, determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures or other relief. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us, as well as matters in which we are involved that are ultimately determined in our favor, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, cause significant reputational harm to our business, divert management attention from the operation of our business and/or result in additional litigation.\nIn addition, in recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed \u201clender liability.\u201d Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders. We have been and in the future could become subject to claims based on this or other evolving legal theories.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nFuture issuances of equity securities could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock, and our common stock ranks junior to indebtedness.\nOur common stock ranks junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness with respect to distributions and liquidation. In addition, future issuances of equity securities, including pursuant to outstanding options, could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders, including you, and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, phantom shares, stock appreciation rights, options or warrants to purchase our common stock in the future and those stock appreciation rights, options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units vest, our shareholders may experience further dilution.\nHolders of our shares of common stock do not have preemptive rights. Additionally, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets and the availability of those shares for sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur ability to deliver and pay dividends depends primarily upon the results of operations of our subsidiary Bank, and we may not pay, or be permitted to pay, dividends in the future.\nWe are a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through our subsidiary Bank. As a result, our ability to make dividend payments on our common stock will depend primarily upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from the Bank.\nThe ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other payments to us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, is limited by the Bank\u2019s obligation to maintain sufficient capital and by other general regulatory restrictions on its dividends, which have tightened since the financial crisis. The Federal Reserve has stated that bank holding companies should not pay dividends from sources other than current earnings. If these requirements are not satisfied, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe may also decide to limit the payment of dividends even when we have the legal ability to pay them in order to retain earnings for use in our business, which could adversely affect the market value of our common stock. There can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends in the future.\nMississippi law, and anti-takeover provisions in our amended articles of incorporation and bylaws could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult and may adversely affect share value.\nOur amended articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us (even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders) and for holders of our securities to receive any related takeover premium for their securities.\nWe are also subject to certain provisions of state and federal law and our articles of incorporation that may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity, or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, including shares of our common stock. Banking agencies review the acquisition to determine if it will result in a change of control. The banking agencies have 60 days to act on the notice, and take into account several factors, including the resources of the acquirer and the antitrust effects of the acquisition. Additionally, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank. There are also Mississippi statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. As a result, these statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nShares of our common stock are not insured deposits and may lose value.\nShares of our common stock are not savings accounts, deposits or other obligations of any depository institution and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nSecurities analysts might not continue coverage on our common stock, which could adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts, and they may not continue to cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not continue to cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If securities analysts continue to cover our common stock, and our common stock is the subject of an unfavorable report, the price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe must attract and retain skilled personnel.\nOur success depends, in substantial part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled, experienced personnel in key positions within the organization. Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that we serve is intense. If we are not able to hire, adequately compensate, or retain these key individuals, we may be unable to execute our business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Recent labor shortages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may also restrict our ability to attract and retain personnel.\nNatural and man-made disasters, including those caused or exacerbated by climate change, could affect our ability to operate.\nOur market areas are often impacted by hurricanes and flooding. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, flooding, tornados, freezes and other natural and man-made disasters, such as oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, can disrupt our operations, result in significant damage to our properties or properties and businesses of our borrowers, including property pledged as collateral, interrupt our ability to conduct business, negatively affect the local economies in which we operate, and increase circumstances leading to litigation.\nWe cannot predict whether or to what extent damage caused by future hurricanes and other disasters will affect our operations or the economies in our market areas, but such events could cause a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing the loans and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures, loan losses and litigation. Climate change may increase the nature, severity and frequency of adverse weather conditions in our footprint, making the impact from these types of natural disasters on us or our customers worse.\nWe rely on the existence of, and ability of private and public insurance programs to provide coverage for these types of events. The unavailability of these types of coverage or the inability of these entities to perform could have a materially adverse impact on our operations.\nSocietal, legislative and regulatory responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The Company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions and operating process changes. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including a significant presence in areas that are\nvulnerable to natural and man-made disasters that may be exacerbated by climate change or reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to the Company could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nWe are exposed to reputational risk.\nNegative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged improper activities, such as lending practices, data security breaches, corporate governance policies and decisions, and acquisitions, any of which may damage our reputation. Negative public opinion can also result from action or inaction related to environmental, social and corporate governance matters. Additionally, actions taken by government regulators and community organizations may also damage our reputation. Negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers or expose us to litigation and regulatory action.\nChanges in accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), including the accounting rules and regulations of the Commission and the FASB, requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that impact our financial statements by affecting the value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because materially different amounts may be reported if different estimates or assumptions are used. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the Commission change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of such standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict, may require extraordinary efforts or additional costs to implement and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we may be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements in material amounts.", "PERMNO": 76684, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HWC"}
