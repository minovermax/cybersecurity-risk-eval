{"cik": "1498301", "company": "Ascena Retail Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are risks associated with an investment in our securities. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our prospects, our operational results, our financial condition, our liquidity, the trading price of our securities, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. The risk factors generally have been separated into four groups: (1) Bankruptcy Specific Risks; (2) Macroeconomic and Industry Risks; (3) Operational Risks; and (4) Legal and Regulatory Risks. Based upon information currently known to us, the Company believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company and our securities. However, the risks and uncertainties are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. Our operational results, financial position and cash flows could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to, those described below. If we are not successful in managing these risks, they could have a negative impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nBankruptcy Specific Risks\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks.\nWe expect that our equity holders could experience a complete loss on their investment, depending on the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. The terms of the restructuring support agreement contemplates that the Company\u2019s common stock will be canceled. We caution that trading in our securities, including our common stock, during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Trading prices for our common stock may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders of our securities in the Chapter 11 Cases. See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information on the restructuring support agreement and the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOn July 23, 2020, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries commenced the Chapter 11 Cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our strategic business plan, as well as our continuation as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include the following:\n\u2022our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan or alternative restructuring transaction;\n\u2022the high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related fees;\n\u2022our ability to obtain court approval with respect to motions filed in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases from time to time;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our relationships with our landlords, suppliers, vendors, service providers, customers, employees and other third parties;\n\u2022our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u2022the ability of third parties to seek and obtain approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us;\n\u2022the ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a Chapter 11 plan, to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, or to convert the Chapter 11 Cases to a Chapter 7 proceeding; and\n\u2022the action and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in the Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our strategic business plan.\nDelays in our Chapter 11 Cases increase the risks of us being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events associated with the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our relationships with our landlords, suppliers, vendors, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, we need the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact of events that will occur during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our strategic business plans.\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including our ability to reduce expenses, implement any strategic initiatives and generally maintain favorable relationships with, and secure the confidence of, our counterparties. Further, due to the uncertainty around the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related disruption to our business and financial impacts, and because our plans, including those in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, are not yet finalized, fully executed, or approved by the Bankruptcy Court, we cannot guarantee that the proposed financial restructuring will achieve our stated goals nor can we give any assurance of our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOperating under Bankruptcy Court protection for an extended period of time may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization. An extended period of operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on business, operational results, financial position and cash flows. So long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. In addition, the longer the Chapter 11 Cases continue, the more likely it is that our landlords, suppliers and customers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and will seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nAdditionally, so long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, we will be required to incur significant costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases. Although we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to operate our business during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, there can be no assurance that the cash made\navailable to us under the DIP Facilities (as defined in Item 7 herein) or otherwise in our restructuring process and revenue generated by our business operations will be sufficient to fund our operations. In the event that revenues and other available cash are not sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements, we may be required to seek additional financing, and there can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available or, if available, offered on terms that are acceptable. If we are unable to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all, our chances of successfully reorganizing our business may be seriously jeopardized, and the likelihood that we instead will be required to liquidate our assets may be enhanced.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities that will be subject to a plan of reorganization. Even once a plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders and other counterparties to do business with a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nTo emerge successfully from Bankruptcy Court protection as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory requirements with respect to adequacy of disclosure with respect to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, solicit and obtain the requisite acceptances of such plan and fulfill other statutory conditions for confirmation of such plan, which have not occurred to date. The confirmation process is subject to numerous, unanticipated potential delays. If a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims against us would ultimately receive with respect to their claims.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources, and in addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the Chapter 11 Cases and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) availability under the DIP Facilities and our ability to comply with their terms, conditions and covenants, (ii) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any cash collateral order that may be entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iv) our ability to generate cash flow from operations, (v) our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan or other alternative restructuring transaction, and (vi) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. There is no certainty that we will be able to comply with the covenants of the DIP Facilities or that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 Cases until we are able to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nBecause of our financial condition, we will have heightened exposure to, and less ability to withstand, the operating risks that are customary in our industry, such as fluctuations in raw material prices and currency exchange rates. Any of these factors could result in the need for substantial additional funding. A number of other factors, including the Chapter 11 Cases, our recent financial results, our substantial indebtedness and the competitive environment we face, adversely affect the availability and terms of funding that might be available to us during bankruptcy. As such, we may not be able to source capital at rates acceptable to us, or at all, to fund our current operations. The inability to obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on us and on our ability to sustain our operations.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nDuring the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely to not be indicative of our financial performance after the date of the bankruptcy filing. In addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to July 23, 2020, would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and/or discharged in accordance with the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged through the plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have a material adverse effect on business, operational results, financial position and cash flows on a post-reorganization basis.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases have and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition.\nWhile the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the cases. This diversion of attention may have a material adverse effect on business, operational results, financial position and cash flows, particularly if the Chapter 11 Cases are protracted. Additionally, as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and our employees likely will face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incent key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team or material erosion of employee morale could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on business, financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nThere can be no assurance as to whether we will successfully reorganize and emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases or, if we do successfully reorganize, as to when we would emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nIf the Bankruptcy Court finds that it would be in the best interest of creditors and/or the Debtors, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate the Debtors\u2019 assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to the Debtors\u2019 creditors than those provided for in a Chapter 11 plan or reorganization because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a disorderly fashion over a short period of time rather than reorganizing or selling in a controlled manner the Debtors\u2019 businesses as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, cash flow and results of operations for an extended period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy as federal, state and local governments react to, and manage, this public health crisis, which has created significant uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the significant impact of the pandemic on the economy, our customers, supply chain partners, associates and stores, and consumer sentiment in general. In response to the pandemic, which has materially adversely affected our near-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows, and resulting economic uncertainty, and in an effort to preserve capital, we have, among other measures, closed stores and furloughed associates, reduced base salaries, reduced advertising expenses and planned capital expenditures, extended vendor payment terms and withheld rent payments. We have also reduced merchandise inventory orders, which could impact product availability and sales in future periods due to both the operational issues associated with the reduced orders as well as the result of extended payment terms. In May 2020, we began the process of reopening our stores to the public in accordance with local, state and federal health and safety guidelines, and in June 2020, previous reductions in base salaries were restored.\nThe substantial majority of our retail stores have re-opened to the public, most with restricted operations. However, we are experiencing significantly reduced customer traffic relative to the same period last year, even with respect to our fully re-opened stores. As our stores re-open, new practices or protocols could impact our business and may continue and/or increase our operating costs, such as, for example, occupancy limitations. The Company continues to closely monitor changes in government guidelines, as well as any possible resurgence of the pandemic, and may have to as a result extend closures or restrict operations of our stores, corporate offices and distribution facilities. In addition, in some cases, we have had to close stores that had reopened. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial position, cash flows and\nresults of operations will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration, spread, severity, impact and possible resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of the pandemic on our customers, associates and vendors, and the regulatory response and the impact of stimulus measures adopted by local, state and federal governments, and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. As such, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business remain highly uncertain. Additionally, an extended period of remote working by the Company\u2019s corporate employees could strain its technology resources and introduce operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk. Remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic, by materially reducing our near-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows, also magnifies many of the other risks to our business, operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nEven after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we may continue to experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of an economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future due to a continued erosion in consumer sentiment or the effect of high unemployment on our customer base. Furthermore, the financial condition of our customers may be adversely impacted, which may result in a decrease in discretionary consumer spending and our store traffic and sales. These events may, in turn, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nEconomic and political conditions and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control impacting consumer spending may adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions that are beyond the Company\u2019s control that could impact consumer discretionary spending. Some of the factors negatively impacting consumer spending and consumer sentiment include volatility in national and international financial markets, recession, inflation, deflation, consumer confidence, fiscal and monetary policies of government, unemployment and wage levels, increased taxation, credit availability, high consumer debt, higher fuel costs, energy and other prices, tax policies and changes in tax laws, increasing interest rates, severe or unseasonable weather conditions, natural disasters, public health concerns, including global pandemics, civil disturbances, the threat of or actual terrorist attacks, military conflicts, the domestic or international political environment, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment as well as the prospects of these factors and events. Such macroeconomic and other factors could have a negative effect on consumer spending in the U.S., which in turn could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nExisting and increased competition and fundamental shifts in the women\u2019s and girls\u2019 retail apparel industry may reduce our net revenues, operational results and market share.\nThe women\u2019s and girls\u2019 retail apparel industry is highly competitive. Although the Company is a large specialty retailer, we have numerous and varied competitors at the national, regional and local level, primarily consisting of department stores, off-price retailers, other specialty stores, discount stores, mass merchandisers, boutiques, and Internet retailers, some of whom have advantages over us, including substantially greater financial, marketing or promotional resources. Many retailers, such as department stores, also offer a broader selection of merchandise than we offer, continue to be promotional by reducing their selling prices, and in some cases are expanding into markets in which we have a significant presence.\nIn addition, the growth and prominence of fast-fashion and value-fashion retailers and expansion of off-price retailers have fundamentally shifted customers\u2019 expectations of affordable pricing of well-known brands and has resulted in the continuation of increased promotional pressure. The rise of these retailers as well as the shift in shopping preferences away from brick-and-mortar stores to the direct channel, where online-only businesses or those with robust direct channel capabilities can facilitate competitive entry and comparison shopping in our brands, have increased the difficulty of maintaining and gaining market share. The Company\u2019s execution of its own omni-channel strategy to adapt to these changes, in relation to its competitors\u2019 actions as well as to its customers\u2019 adoption of new technology, presents a specific risk.\nThese competitive factors, including unanticipated changes in pricing, promotional activity such as free shipping and pricing pressures, and other practices of the Company\u2019s competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nExtreme weather could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nFrequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, hurricanes, rainstorms or other extreme or unseasonable weather conditions over an extended period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores, may cause a disruption in the shipment or receipt of our merchandise, and may influence customer trends, consumer traffic and shopping habits, which could negatively impact the Company's operational results. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which the Company's stores are located could negatively affect the Company's business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nActs of terrorism, active shooter situations, political unrest, public health incidents, man-made and natural disasters or other catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nActs of terrorism and other catastrophic events remain a significant threat to the global economy. Terrorism and potential military responses, active shooter situations, political unrest, natural disasters, global pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and other health issues have disrupted or could in the future disrupt commerce, impact our ability to operate our stores, offices or distribution and fulfillment centers in the affected areas or impact our ability to provide critical functions or services necessary to the operation of our business, including our and our third-party vendors\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other providers\u2019 systems and the networks as well as the utilities and telecommunications infrastructure on which our business depends. A disruption of commerce, or an inability to recover critical functions or services from such a disruption, could interfere with the production, shipment or receipt of our merchandise in a timely manner or increase our costs to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows. In addition, any of the above disruptions could undermine consumer confidence, which could negatively impact consumer spending or customer traffic, and thus have an adverse effect on our operational results.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse impact of any of the above disruptions also depends, in part, upon the effectiveness of our disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning. However, we cannot be certain that our plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an actual disaster or other catastrophic situation. In addition, although we maintain insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us.\nDisruptions at ports used to import our products could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe currently ship the vast majority of our products by ocean. If a disruption occurs in the operation of ports through which our products are imported, we and our vendors may have to ship some or all of our products from Asia or other regions by air freight or to alternate shipping destinations in the United States. Shipping by air is significantly more expensive than shipping by ocean and our profitability could be reduced. Similarly, shipping to alternate destinations in the United States could lead to increased lead times and costs for our products. A disruption at ports (domestic or abroad) through which our products are imported could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nIncreases in the price of raw materials, labor, energy, freight and trade relations could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nRaw materials used to manufacture our merchandise are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high or low demand for fabrics, labor conditions, trade wars and higher tariffs, transportation or freight costs, currency fluctuations, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, economic inflation, market speculation and other factors. Increases in the demand for and price of cotton, wool and other raw materials used in the production of fabric and accessories, as well as increases in labor and energy costs or shortages of skilled labor, could result in increases for the costs of our products as well as their distribution to our distribution centers, retail locations and to our customers. The Company is also susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of transportation. Additionally, substantially increased uncertainty with respect to trade relations, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could result in trade wars, higher barriers and tariffs, and higher product costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOperational Risks\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion trends and customer preferences in a timely manner.\nSpecialty fashion apparel trends and customer preferences tend to change rapidly, particularly for women and tween girls, and our business is dependent upon our ability to effectively manage our inventory. Our success depends largely on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, our failure to anticipate, identify and react to changing fashion trends or styles could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our merchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business and our image with our customers. Because the lead times required for many of our design and purchase decisions must be made well in advance of the applicable selling season, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer trends, preferences, price shifting, and the optimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. A miscalculation of either the demand for our merchandise or our customers\u2019 tastes or purchasing habits could lead to, among other things, inventory shortages or excess inventory that we may be required to sell at reduced prices, which would have an adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to effectively manage our inventory levels.\nInventory is one of the largest assets on our balance sheet and represented approximately 14% of our total assets at August 1, 2020. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers\u2019 demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impact our financial results. If our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends or purchasing actions, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial results. We have recorded significant inventory write-downs from time to time in the past and there can be no assurances that we will not record additional inventory charges in the future. We continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks, but we cannot assure that we will be successful in our inventory management. Failing to successfully manage our inventory balances could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nAny divestitures, strategic investments, joint ventures or other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives and result in operating difficulties, liabilities and expenses.\nWe have undertaken, and may undertake in the future, divestitures, strategic investments or other transactions in connection with our comprehensive portfolio review. As part of the Chapter 11 Cases, we have divested the Catherines\u2019 E-Commerce business and Justice\u2019s intellectual property and other assets. We have also entered into an agreement to sell assets relating to the Company\u2019s Ann Taylor, LOFT and Lane Bryant brands. In addition, our Company\u2019s business model may include a certain level of joint venture and/or divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time deliver against our business objectives.\nSpecifically, with respect to divestitures, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings and corporate overhead contribution/allocation associated with divested brands. We may experience difficulty separating out portions of the entire business, incur potential loss of revenue or experience negative impact on margins, or we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits from these transactions. Such transactions may also delay achievement of our strategic objectives, cause us to incur additional expenses, potentially disrupt customer or employee relationships, and expose us to unanticipated or ongoing obligations and liabilities, including any indemnification obligations, and divert management\u2019s and our employees\u2019 time and attention. Further, during the pendency of a divestiture, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business, loss of employees, customers, or suppliers and the risk that the transaction may not close, any of which would have a material adverse effect on the business to be divested and the Company. If a divestiture is not completed for any reason, we may not be able to find another buyer on the same terms, and we may have incurred significant costs without the corresponding benefit.\nOur financial results could also be impacted in the event of joint venture activities if changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to decline below book value, or we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such joint ventures, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement and optimize our omni-channel retail strategy and maintain a relevant and reliable omni-channel experience for our customers.\nOne of our strategic priorities is to further develop and refine the omni-channel shopping experience, with our buy-online-pickup-in-store program for our customers through the integration of our store and direct shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further direct channel integration, use of advance analytics, customer personalization, the assessment and implementation of emerging technologies. These initiatives involve significant investments in information technology systems, operational changes, and employee resources.\nIn addition, successful implementation of our omni-channel strategy is dependent on our ability to develop our direct channel capabilities in conjunction with optimizing our physical store operations and market coverage, while maintaining profitability. The Company\u2019s ability to optimize its store operations and market coverage requires active management of its real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve by brand over time. These efforts may involve the relocation or closing of existing stores or possibly the opening of additional stores, which could potentially increase the cost of doing business and the risk that the Company\u2019s business practices could result in liabilities that could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nIf the implementation of our customer, direct, and omni-channel initiatives are not successful, or we do not realize our expected return on our investment in these initiatives, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to maintain our brand image, engage new and existing customers or gain market share.\nOur success is largely dependent on our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation and our customers\u2019 connections with our brands. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend largely on the success of our design, merchandising and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. In addition, our success depends, in part, on our ability to keep existing customers, while engaging and attracting new customers to shop our brands. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives for any of our brands. Failure to achieve consistent, positive performance at several of our brands simultaneously could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nFurther, the use of social media by the Company and consumers has also increased the risk that the Company\u2019s image and reputation could be negatively impacted. The availability of information, reviews and opinions on social media is immediate, as is its impact. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate and inflammatory information and opinion, is nearly infinite. Even if we react quickly and appropriately to negative social media about us or our brands, our reputation and customers\u2019 perception of our brands could be negatively impacted. Damage to the brand image and reputation of the Company in any aspect of its operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business depends on effective marketing, advertising and promotional programs.\nCustomer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising, marketing and promotional activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands, and the location of and service offered in our stores, in addition to many initiatives focused on direct channel and mobile applications, including social media. Although we use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including social media, database marketing and print, if our competitors increase their spending on marketing, advertising and promotional programs, if our marketing, advertising and promotional expenses increase, if our programs become less effective than those of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise and effective competitive insight, our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe depend on key personnel in order to support our existing business and future initiatives and may not be able to retain or replace these employees, recruit additional qualified personnel or effectively manage succession.\nOur success may be adversely impacted if we are not able to attract, retain and develop talent and future leaders, including our senior executives and associates. Our senior executive team closely supervises all major aspects of our business including the design, development, and procurement of merchandise; operation of our information technology platforms, supply chain, and store network; development and retention of critical talent; and financial planning, reporting and compliance. Our senior executive team has substantial experience and expertise in our retail business, and serves an integral role in the growth and support of our brands. If we were to lose the leadership of additional senior executives or other personnel, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if significant unexpected turnover occurs at the associate level, the loss of the services of these individuals, or any resulting negative perceptions of our business, could damage our reputation and our business. Competition for such qualified talent is intense, and we cannot be sure we will be able to find suitable successors promptly, or at all, or to successfully integrate any successors, or that we will be able to attract, retain and develop a sufficient number of qualified individuals in future periods.\nWe are dependent on our vendors and factors for credit to acquire merchandise, and any disruption in our supply of merchandise would materially impact us.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to purchase merchandise at competitive terms through relationships with our vendors and their factors, as applicable, and we depend on our vendors to provide financing on our purchases of merchandise. Any significant change in vendor and factor financing or support could limit our ability to acquire desired merchandise at competitive prices or payment terms. In addition, any insolvency of our vendors or their inability to access liquidity could lead to their failure to deliver merchandise. Certain vendors finance their operations and reduce the risk associated with collecting accounts receivable by selling or \u201cfactoring\u201d the receivables or by purchasing credit insurance or other forms of protection from loss, and the ability of vendors to do so is subject to the perceived credit quality of their customers. Our vendors\u2019 ability to factor receivables or obtain credit protection in the future because of our perceived financial position and creditworthiness could be limited, which could reduce the availability of merchandise and increase the cost to us of the merchandise. Additionally, if we experience declining operating performance or liquidity challenges, vendors and their factors may seek protection against non-payment, such as accelerated payment terms, letters of credit and tighter limits on credit.\nWe have ongoing discussions with the vendor community and factors/third parties that offer various trade credit protection services to our vendors concerning our liquidity and financial position, including discussions regarding pricing, payment terms\nand ongoing business arrangements. Vendors may be less willing to conduct business with us on customary trade terms during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases and, in some instances could decline to do business with us altogether. Any adverse or prolonged change in our trade credit or access to merchandise for these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on foreign sources of production and other international service providers.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and may impair our ability to operate effectively. We purchase nearly all of our merchandise from foreign sources, both directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources. Our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult for goods sourced outside the United States.\nAdditionally, through outsourcing arrangements, we have engaged in efforts to reduce our costs by utilizing lower-cost labor outside the U.S. in countries which may be subject to higher degrees of political and/or social instability than the U.S. and may lack the infrastructure to withstand events that may disrupt their business. Such disruptions could impact our ability to deliver our products and services on a timely basis, if at all, and to a lesser extent could decrease efficiency and increase our costs.\nWe face a variety of risks generally associated with doing business in and outsourcing certain services to foreign markets and importing large quantities of merchandise from abroad, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022financial or political instability or terrorist acts in any of the countries in which we operate, outsource services or acquire our merchandise, or through which our merchandise passes;\n\u2022new and additional U.S. government initiatives may be proposed or implemented that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties, tariffs or other trade sanctions that, if enacted, could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries or restrict the importation of products from such countries;\n\u2022fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies or higher inflation rates in these countries, or restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries;\n\u2022inability of our manufacturers to comply with local laws, including labor laws, health and safety laws or labor practices;\n\u2022increased security and regulatory requirements and inspections applicable to imported goods;\n\u2022enactment of tariffs, border adjustment taxes or increases in duties or quotas applicable to the merchandise we sell that could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us;\n\u2022impact of public health concerns, including global pandemics, natural disasters, extreme weather or other catastrophes on our foreign sourcing offices and vendor manufacturing operations;\n\u2022increased scrutiny in the U.S. of utilizing labor based in foreign countries;\n\u2022delays in shipping due to port security or congestion issues, labor disputes or shortages, local business practices, vendor compliance with applicable import regulations or weather conditions;\n\u2022violations under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) or similar laws or regulations by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents;\n\u2022the adoption of new legislation or regulations in the U.S. or foreign countries that make it more difficult, more costly or impossible to continue our foreign activities;\n\u2022violation of applicable laws or regulations; and\n\u2022increased costs and/or capacities of transportation.\nThe future performance of our business depends on foreign suppliers and service providers, and may be adversely affected by the factors listed above, most of which are beyond our control. The foregoing may impact our ability to deliver our products and services on a timely basis, increase costs, negate or offset any cost reductions anticipated from operating outside the U.S., decrease our efficiency or result in our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise.\nWe require our vendors, manufacturers and other service providers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, and our internal requirements. Our vendor code of conduct, guidelines and other compliance programs promote ethical business practices, and we monitor compliance with them; however, we do not control these vendors or manufacturers, their labor practices or business practices, the health and safety conditions of their facilities, or their sources of raw materials, and from time to time these vendors, manufactures or other service providers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable laws. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors, manufacturers or other service providers could have a negative impact on our reputation and our business, and could subject us to liability in the form of substantial financial penalties, sanctions or otherwise.\nAny of the aforementioned risks, independently or in combination with others, could have an adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and a potential resulting trade war, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe source the majority of our merchandise from foreign countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, China, India, Guatemala, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, making the price and availability of our merchandise susceptible to international trade risks and other international conditions. In September 2018, the U.S. government implemented a 10% tariff on certain goods imported from China. In May 2019, these tariffs were increased to 25%. In September 2019, the U.S. government implemented a 15% tariff on certain additional goods imported from China, and subsequently reduced that tariff rate to 7.5% in February 2020 as a result of the Phase One U.S.-China trade agreement. In October 2020, the U.S. government launched an investigation on Vietnam similar to the investigation on China. Based on the findings and potential actions taken by the administration at that time, certain goods from Vietnam could be subject to additional tariffs. The imposition of such tariffs, or any future tariffs, duties or other trade restrictions by the United States could also result in the adoption of new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions by other countries. The tariffs may in the future cause us to further increase prices to our customers which we believe may reduce demand for our products. Any such price increase may not be sufficient to fully offset the impact of the tariffs and result in lowering our margin on products sold. If the current administration or a future administration increases or implements additional tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the U.S. or other countries, the resulting trade barriers could have a significant adverse impact on our business. We are not able to predict future trade policy of the U.S. or of any foreign countries in which we operate or purchase goods, or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements, or their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions and tariffs, quotas and embargoes, the occurrence of a \u201ctrade war,\u201d or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies, has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers and the world and U.S. economies, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer as a result of a third-party manufacturer\u2019s inability to produce goods for us on time and to our specifications.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third-parties for the manufacture of all of the goods that we sell. Both domestic and international manufacturers produce these goods. The Company is at risk for increases in manufacturing costs, and we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with these third-party manufacturers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with merchandise specifications, insufficient quality control and failure to meet production deadlines. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of world-wide events, including inclement weather, natural or man-made disasters, public health issues, strikes, acts of terror or political, social or economic conditions on our major suppliers. Our suppliers could also face economic pressures as a result of rising wages and inflation or be affected by trade wars or increases in tariffs materially impacting their business or experience difficulty obtaining adequate credit or access to liquidity to finance their operations, which could lead to vendor consolidation. A manufacturer's inability to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our cost, safety, quality and social compliance standards could result in supply delays, shortages, failure to meet customer expectations and damage to our brands, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments.\nWe currently rely primarily on one independent third-party transportation provider for substantially all of our merchandise shipments, including shipments to our stores and to the customer directly in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico through our direct channel. Our use of third-party delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increased fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact a shipper\u2019s ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. If we change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely impact deliveries and we would incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the independent third-party transportation providers we currently use, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer a material adverse effect if our distribution or fulfillment centers were shut down, disrupted or fail to operate efficiently.\nWe operate three distribution and fulfillment centers to manage the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of our merchandise to the appropriate stores or to the customer directly through our direct channel. We depend in large part on the orderly operation of our receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules, proper\nfunctioning of our information technology and inventory control systems and overall effective management of our distribution and fulfillment centers. As a result of damage to, or prolonged interruption of, operations at any of these facilities, or with respect to our third-party transportation provider, due to a work stoppage, operations significantly below historical efficiency levels, supply chain disruption, inclement weather, natural or man-made disasters, system failures, slowdowns or strikes, acts of terror or other unforeseen events, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores or customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows. Refer to Item 2. Properties, for a listing of the distribution and fulfillment centers that we rely on.\nAlthough we maintain business interruption and property insurance for these facilities, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us, if our distribution or fulfillment centers are shut down or interrupted for any unplanned reason.\nWe also continue to explore ways to further optimize and leverage our integrated distribution network, which may include providing distribution and fulfillment services to third-party retailers. Any disruption of our distribution and fulfillment capabilities would also impact any third-party services we may provide in the future. There also can be no assurance that providing such distribution and fulfillment services to third parties would be successful or profitable for us.\nRisks associated with direct channel sales.\nThe successful operation of our direct channel business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and continuous operation of our websites and our associated fulfillment operations, and to provide a customer engaging shopping experience that will generate orders and return visits to our websites. Our direct channel services are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022system failures, including but not limited to, inadequate system capacity, human error, change in programming, website downtimes, system upgrades or migrations, Internet service or power outages;\n\u2022cyber incidents, including but not limited to, security breaches and computer viruses;\n\u2022reliance on third-party computer hardware/software fulfillment and delivery providers;\n\u2022unfavorable federal or state regulations or laws;\n\u2022violations of federal, state or other applicable laws, including those related to online privacy;\n\u2022disruptions in telecommunication systems, power outages or other technical failures;\n\u2022ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics;\n\u2022credit card fraud;\n\u2022constantly evolving technology;\n\u2022liability for online content;\n\u2022challenges associated with recreating the in-store experience for our customers through our direct channels; and\n\u2022natural or man-made disasters or adverse weather conditions.\nOur failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted order-taking and fulfillment operations or our failure to successfully address and respond to any one or more of these risks could damage the reputation of our brands and have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer if our information technology systems fail to operate effectively, are disrupted or are compromised.\nOur success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our existing information technology systems in operating, supporting and monitoring all major aspects of our business, including sales (including stores and direct channel services), warehousing, fulfillment, distribution, purchasing, inventory control, merchandise planning and replenishment, and financial systems. We regularly evaluate and from time to time make investments to upgrade, enhance or replace these systems, including those that relate to point-of-sale, direct channel, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems, which are utilized by our human resources, finance and other groups on a Company-wide basis, as well as leverage new technologies to support our growth strategies. We are aware of inherent risks associated with operating, replacing and modifying these systems, including inaccurate system information and system disruptions. We believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, staging implementation and in-sourcing certain processes, as well as securing appropriate commercial contracts with third-party vendors supplying such replacement and redundancy technologies; however, there is a risk that information technology system disruptions and inaccurate system information, if not anticipated and/or appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nThe reliability and capacity of our information technology systems (including third-party hardware and software systems or services) are critical to our continued operations. Despite our precautionary efforts, our information technology systems, as well as those of our services providers, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including natural or man-\nmade disasters, technical malfunctions, inadequate systems capacity, power outages, computer viruses, malicious human acts, security breaches and similar disruptive problems, which may require significant investment to fix or replace, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays to our operations.\nWhile we believe we are diligent in the execution of operational standards to maintain the level of confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our information technology systems, we realize that there are risks and that no assurances can be made that future disruptions, service outages/failures, or unauthorized access will not occur. Certain of our information technology support functions are performed by third-parties in overseas locations. Failure by any of these third-parties to implement and/or manage our information systems and infrastructure effectively and securely could impact our operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and other risks associated with data security breaches, credit card fraud and identity theft, which may subject us to increased risk of liability and may cause us to incur increased expenses to mitigate our exposure or to address any such incidents.\nDuring the course of our business, we obtain and transmit confidential customer, employee, vendor and Company information through our information technology systems, and we are subject to numerous laws, rules and regulations in the United States (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdictions to protect both individual identifiable information as well as personal health information. The protection of customer, employee, vendor and Company data is critical to our business. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is demanding, with frequent changes in requirements and heightened public awareness and scrutiny.\nOur business and that of our third-party service providers employ systems and websites that allow us to process credit card transactions containing personally identifiable information (\"PII\"), perform online direct channel and social media activities, and store and transmit proprietary or confidential customer, employee, job applicant and other personal confidential information, as well as the information of our vendors and suppliers. Security and/or privacy breaches, acts of vandalism or terror, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human error or other similar events could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, reputational harm, litigation and potential liability. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to our systems are constantly changing and becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we or our third-party service providers may not be able to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures. We, our customers and our third-party service providers face an evolving threat landscape in which cybercriminals, among others, employ a complex array of cyber-attack techniques designed to access PII and other information, including for example, the use of fraudulent or stolen access credentials, malware, ransomware, phishing, denial of service and other types of attacks. These types of cyber-attacks are becoming more prevalent, have occurred in our systems in the past, and may occur in our systems in the future. Additionally, the extended period of remote working by the Company\u2019s corporate employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic could strain our technology resources and introduce heightened cybersecurity risk. Remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. While we have implemented and intend to continue to implement what we believe to be appropriate cyber practices and cyber security systems and controls, these systems may prove to be inadequate and result in the disruption, failure, misappropriation or corruption of our systems and infrastructure. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur significant and additional costs, including, but not limited to the costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, engage third-party experts and consultants and compliance costs associated with various applicable laws or industry standards regarding use and/or unauthorized disclosure of PII. We may also incur significant remediation costs, including liability for stolen customer, job applicant or employee information, repairing system damage or providing credit monitoring or other benefits to affected customers, job applicants or employees.\nIn addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breaches by us or by our third-party service providers that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information, employee error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities that may result in a defeat of our or our third-party providers\u2019 security measures. We are also exposed to risks and costs associated with customer payment methods, including credit card fraud and identify theft, which may cause us to incur unexpected expenses and loss of revenues.\nAlthough we maintain cyber security insurance, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will cover the particular cyber incident at issue or that such coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be paid to us in a timely manner.\nThe protection of customer, employee and Company PII and other data is critical, and our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. Any actual or perceived misappropriation, unauthorized disclosure or breach involving this data could attract negative media attention, cause substantial harm to our reputation or brand and result in significant liability (including but not limited to mandatory notifications, fines, substantial penalties or lawsuits), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nAs we transition certain functions to an externally managed service provider, we will become more dependent on the third-party performing these functions.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we look for opportunities to cost-effectively enhance the capability of our business services. In some cases, this requires that we outsource certain services and/or functions to external third-party providers. While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties, the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services on a timely basis, at the level of quality expected, or at the prices/savings expected could disrupt or harm our business. Any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers, over which we have no control, could also have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely or cost-effective basis on terms favorable to us.\nAny further impairment to the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could result in significant non-cash charges and could have a material adverse effect on our operational results.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized, but are evaluated annually for impairment. A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. As of August 1, 2020, we had approximately $298.8 million of goodwill and other intangible assets substantially related to the acquisitions of ANN in August 2015. Current and future economic conditions, as well as the other risks noted in this Item 1A, may adversely impact our brands' ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers, maintain sales volumes and maintain margins. As discussed in our Critical Accounting Policies included elsewhere in this report, these events could materially reduce our brands' profitability and cash flows which could, in turn, lead to a further impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, significant negative industry or general economic trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets may result in additional impairments to our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. As described in Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein, in Fiscal 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $148.9 million and $128.7 million, respectively, related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Additionally, in Fiscal 2020, we recognized impairment charges of $399.0 million related to our store fixed assets, our right-of-use assets and other long-lived tangible assets. Incremental charges may result from additional store closures based on the Debtors' review or rejection of other leases and contracts, or due to changes in other factors or circumstances, including deterioration in the macroeconomic environment or in the retail industry, deterioration in our performance or our future projections as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases or otherwise, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analyses, or changes in our plans for one or more indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment analyses are particularly sensitive to changes in the projected revenue growth rate and the assumed weighted-average cost of capital or other discount rates. Changes to these key assumptions could result in revisions of management's estimates of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets or right-of-use lease assets and could result in impairment charges in the future, which could be material to our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our core trademarks and service marks, as described in Item 1. Business, are essential to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and service marks on a worldwide basis, including in the countries in which we have business operations or plan to have business operations. Because we have not registered all of our trademarks in all categories, or in all foreign countries in which we currently, or may in the future, source or offer our merchandise, our international expansion and our merchandising of products using these marks could be negatively impacted. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or material challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks in the United States. Nevertheless, the actions we have taken, including to establish and protect our trademarks and service marks, may not be adequate to prevent others from imitating our products or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products, which could be detrimental to the image of our brands. Also, others may assert proprietary rights in our intellectual property, and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Any litigation regarding our trademarks could be time-consuming and costly. The loss of exclusive use of our trademarks in the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may suffer negative publicity and our business may be harmed if we need to recall any product we sell or if we fail to comply with applicable product safety laws.\nThe products our brands sell are regulated by many different governmental bodies, including but not limited to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S., Health Canada in Canada, and similar state, provincial and foreign regulatory authorities. Although our practice is to test (or have our suppliers test) the products sold in our\nbrands\u2019 stores and on our brands\u2019 websites for compliance with applicable mandatory and industry standards, selected products still could present safety problems of which our brands are not aware. This could lead one or more of our brands to recall selected products, either voluntarily or at the direction of a governmental authority and may lead to a lack of consumer acceptance or loss of consumer trust. Product safety concerns, non-compliance with standards, recalls, defects or errors could result in the rejection of our products by customers, significant damage to our reputation, lost sales, product liability litigation and increased costs, any or all of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operational results and cash flows.\nThe cost of compliance with current and future requirements of federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operational results and cash flows. Examples of these requirements include regulatory testing, certification, packaging, labeling, advertising and reporting requirements affecting broad categories of consumer products. In addition, any failure of one or more of our brands to comply with such requirements could result in significant penalties, require one or more of our brands to recall products and harm our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe depend on strip shopping center and mall traffic and our ability to identify suitable store locations.\nOur ability to effectively obtain store locations depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for consumer traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. Many of our stores are located in strip shopping centers, shopping malls and other retail centers that, historically, have benefited from their proximity to \u201canchor\u201d retail tenants, generally large department stores, other destination retailers, and other attractions, which generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Strip shopping center and mall traffic may be adversely affected by, among other things, economic downturns, the closing of, or continued decline of, anchor stores that drive consumer traffic or changes in customer shopping preferences. There has been a decline in the popularity of strip shopping center or mall shopping among our target customers, even before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a continuation of such decline could have a material adverse effect on customer traffic and our operational results. In order to leverage customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers, we need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable consumer locations, however competition for such suitable store locations is intense.\nIn addition, continued consolidation in the commercial retail real estate market could affect our ability to seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our stores. Several large landlords dominate ownership of prime retail real estate and should significant consolidation continue, a large portion of our store base could be concentrated with one or a few landlords that could then be in a position to dictate unfavorable terms to us due to their significant negotiating leverage. If we are unable to negotiate favorable lease terms with these landlords, this could affect our ability to profitably operate our stores, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial condition and cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility in our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales, consumption or value-added taxes (\u201cVAT\u201d) in many jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are evaluated. In addition, our effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or losses by taxing jurisdictions or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Fluctuations in duties could also have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In some international markets, we are required to hold and submit VAT to the appropriate local tax authorities. Failure to correctly calculate or submit the appropriate amounts could subject us to substantial fines and penalties that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, tax law may be enacted in the future, domestically or abroad, that impacts our current or future tax structure and effective tax rate. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d) was signed into law. The Act made broad and significantly complex changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. Given the complexities associated with the Act, the estimated financial impact for Fiscal 2018 was provisional and subject to further analysis, interpretation and clarification. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance in the future on how provisions of the Act will be applied or otherwise administered that differs from our interpretations and could result in changes to our assessment. SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d) requires that the Company finalize its estimate of the impact of the Act by December 22, 2018. In the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, we finalized our assessment of the impact of the Act taking into account the\npublished guidance and recorded the additional cost in the quarter. Refer to Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIn June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states and local jurisdictions may require remote vendors to collect and remit sales tax on goods sold to buyers in the state, even if the seller has no physical presence in the state. A number of states have already begun, or have prepared to begin, requiring sales and use tax collection by remote vendors and/or by online marketplaces. The details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from state to state. We have analyzed each jurisdictions rules where guidance has been issued and are collecting tax accordingly based on the analysis. In the event jurisdictions issue further guidance and we determine we are required to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect taxes, it is possible we would incur additional sales tax, penalties and interest. We believe the impact to the Company\u2019s business, operational results, financial position and cash flows would be minimal.\nOur business may be affected by other regulatory, administrative and litigation developments.\nLaws and regulations at the local, state, federal and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be reasonably estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from regulatory or administrative changes. Changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, advertising and marketing practices, product safety, transportation and logistics, healthcare, tax, accounting, privacy, operations or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nWhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements and our procedures and internal controls are designed to promote such compliance, we cannot assure that all of our operations will at all times comply with all such legal and regulatory requirements. A finding that we or our vendors or agents are out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies or criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows. In addition, even the claim of a violation of applicable laws or regulations could negatively affect our reputation.\nWe are also involved from time to time in litigation, claims and assessments arising primarily in the ordinary course of business. Litigation matters may include, among other things, employment, commercial, intellectual property, advertising or stockholder claims, and any adverse decision in any such litigation or disputes could adversely impact our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate resolutions are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in such proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities. Accordingly, in certain instances, we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Certain of these proceedings could also have a negative impact on the Company's reputation or relations with its employees, customers or other third parties.\nRegulation in the areas of privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect and/or use data.\nOur business involves the storage and/or transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, shipping preferences and credit card information, as well as confidential information regarding our business, employees and third parties. In addition, as part of our acceptance of customers\u2019 debit and credit cards as forms of payment, we are required to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI\u201d).\nBecause we have access to, collect or maintain this information, the protection of this data is critical to our business. The regulatory environment pertaining to information security and privacy continues to evolve, and new laws afford additional rights to control how personal data is used. Once such law is the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). Our failure to comply with the obligations of GDPR could in the future result in significant penalties which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows. In addition, the State of California adopted the California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective in 2020 and regulates the collection and use of consumers\u2019 data. Complying with GDPR, CCPA and similar U.S. federal and state laws, and other countries in which we operate could also cause us to incur substantial costs and could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nIncreases in labor costs related to changes in employment laws or regulations could impact our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nVarious foreign and domestic labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect our operating costs. These include minimum wage requirements, overtime and sick pay, paid time off, work scheduling, healthcare reform and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, and union organizations.
