RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected by known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. We have summarized below the significant, known material risks to our business. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any of these risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause our future financial results to differ materially from recent financial results or from currently anticipated future financial results. The risk factors below should be considered together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cForm 10-K\u201d) as well as other required filings by us with the SEC.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE RISKS\nOur indebtedness could limit our financing options, adversely affect our financial condition, and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nIn December 2019, we completed the refinancing of a portion of our existing debt by entering into both a new revolving credit facility (\u201cNew Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a new term loan (\u201cNew Term Loan\u201d). These replaced the existing revolving credit facility that was entered into in November 2018 (\u201c2018 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The New Revolving Credit Facility is a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility that matures on December 20, 2024 replacing the $100.0 million 2018 Revolving Credit Facility that would have matured on November 21, 2023. The New Term Loan is a $140.0 million senior secured term loan that matures on December 20, 2024. We also have an existing $240.0 million senior secured term loan that was entered into in November 2018 that matures on November 21, 2025 (\u201c2018 Term Loan\u201d). The original amounts available under the New Revolving Credit Facility, New Term Loan, and 2018 Term Loan (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d) in aggregate, totaled $480.0 million. In conjunction with the closing of the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan, we drew down the entire $140.0 million on the New Term Loan and used those proceeds to pay off and close the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility of $58.5 million, paid down a portion of the 2018 Term Loan of $56.0 million, paid the accrued interest associated with the amounts being paid down on the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and 2018 Term Loan, paid the fees related to this transaction, and the remainder used for general corporate expenses.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had a total of $320.6 million of outstanding long-term debt under the Credit Facilities. The total long-term debt was primarily the result of our acquisitions, LaBarge, Inc. in 2011, Lightning Diversion Systems, LLC (\u201cLDS\u201d) in September 2017, Certified Thermoplastics Co., LLC (\u201cCTP\u201d) in April 2018, and Nobles in October 2019.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing or complete a debt refinancing in the future may be limited. Should we not have ready access to capital markets, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as selling assets; reducing or delaying scheduled expansions and/or capital investments; or seeking various other forms of capital. Our ability to complete reasonable alternative financing plans may be affected by circumstances and economic events outside of our control. We cannot ensure that we would be able to refinance our debt or enter into alternative financing plans in adequate amounts on commercially reasonable terms, terms acceptable to us or at all, or that such plans guarantee that we would be able to meet our debt obligations.\nOur level of debt could:\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022require a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022expose us to the risk of increased borrowing costs and higher interest rates as all of our borrowings under our Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates, which could further adversely impact our cash flows;\n\u2022limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022restrict us from making strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022expose us to risk of unfavorable changes in the global credit markets; and\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Credit Facilities and our other debt.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of our outstanding debt.\nWe require a considerable amount of cash to run our business.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt in the future and to fund planned capital expenditures and working capital needs, will depend upon our ability to generate significant cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control.\nIn December 2019, we completed the refinancing of a portion of our existing debt by entering into the New Revolving Credit Facility to replace the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and entered into the New Term Loan. The New Revolving Credit Facility is a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility that matures on December 20, 2024 replacing the $100.0 million 2018 Revolving Credit Facility that would have matured on November 21, 2023. The New Term Loan is a $140.0 million senior secured term loan that matures on December 20, 2024. We also have the 2018 Term Loan of $240.0 million that is a senior secured term loan that matures on November 21, 2025. In conjunction with the closing of the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan, we drew down the entire $140.0 million on the New Term Loan and used those proceeds to pay off and close the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility of $58.5 million, paid down a portion of the 2018 Term Loan of $56.0 million, paid the accrued interest associated with the amounts being paid down on the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and 2018 Term Loan, paid the fees related to this transaction, with the remainder used for general corporate expenses.\nThe terms of the New Term Loan require that we make installment payments of 1.25% of the initial outstanding principal balance on a quarterly basis, on the last day of each calendar quarter. We were required to make installment payments of 0.25% of the outstanding principal balance of the 2018 Term Loan amount on a quarterly basis, however, the $56.0 million we paid as part of the December 2019 refinancing paid all the required quarterly installment payments on the 2018 Term Loan until maturity. In addition, if we exceed the annual excess cash flow threshold, we are required to make an annual additional principal payment based on the consolidated adjusted leverage ratio. Further, the undrawn portion of the commitment of the New Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a commitment fee ranging from 0.175% to 0.275%, based upon the consolidated total net adjusted leverage ratio. In October 2015, we entered into interest rate cap hedges designated as cash flow hedges, with a portion of these interest rate cap hedges maturing on a quarterly basis, with notional value in aggregate, totaling $135.0 million. However, all of these interest rate cap hedges matured in June 2020. At December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance on the Credit Facilities was $320.6 million with an average interest rate of 3.59%. Should interest rates increase significantly, our debt service cost will increase. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile we expect to meet all of our financial obligations, we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nWe require a considerable amount of cash to fund our anticipated voluntary principal prepayments on our Credit Facilities.\nOur ability to continue to reduce the debt outstanding under our Credit Facilities through voluntary principal prepayments will be a contributing factor to our ability to keep our interest rate towards the lower end of the interest rate range as defined in the Credit Facilities. Our ability to make such prepayments will depend upon our ability to generate significant cash in the future. We cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund any such prepayments.\nThe covenants in our Credit Facilities impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nWe are required to comply with a leverage covenant as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility agreement. The leverage covenant is defined as Consolidated Funded Indebtedness less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $5.0 million, divided by consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) and other adjustments.\nAt December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the leverage covenant under the Credit Facilities. However, there is no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with the leverage covenant in future periods.\nThe Credit Facilities\u2019 agreements contains a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to incur additional indebtedness, to create liens, to make certain payments, investments, to engage in transactions with affiliates, to sell certain assets or enter into mergers.\nThese covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, they may restrict our ability to expand, pursue our business strategies and otherwise conduct our business. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions\nand changes in regulations, and we cannot ensure that we will be able to comply with such covenants. These restrictions also limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general.\nA breach of any covenant in the Credit Facilities could result in a default under the Credit Facilities. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under the agreement. A default could permit our lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms or amounts that are acceptable to us or terms as favorable as our current agreements. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method in which LIBOR is determined.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority that regulates London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents the best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on industry wide and/or company specific transition from LIBOR to an alternative that will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or financing costs to borrowers. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt.\nThe typical trading volume of our common stock may affect an investor\u2019s ability to sell significant stock holdings in the future without negatively impacting stock price.\nThe level of trading activity may vary daily and typically represents only a small percentage of outstanding shares. As a result, a stockholder who sells a significant amount of shares in a short period of time could negatively affect our share price.\nOur amount of debt may require us to raise additional capital to fund acquisitions.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock or other equity securities to raise capital in the future, which could dilute the value of an investor\u2019s holdings.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nOur end-use markets are cyclical.\nWe sell our products into aerospace, defense, and industrial end-use markets, which are cyclical and have experienced periodic declines. Our sales are, therefore, unpredictable and may tend to fluctuate based on a number of factors, including global economic conditions, geopolitical developments and conditions, pandemics, and other developments affecting our end-use markets and the customers served. Consequently, results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the operating results that may be experienced in any future period.\nWe depend upon a selected base of industries and customers, which subjects us to unique risks which may adversely affect us.\nWe currently generate a majority of our revenues from customers in the aerospace and defense industry. Our business depends, in part, on the level of new military and commercial aircraft orders. As a result, we have significant sales to certain customers. Sales to The Boeing Company (\u201cBoeing\u201d) and Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (\u201cSpirit\u201d) comprise a significant portion of our commercial aerospace end-use market. A significant portion of our net sales in our military and space end-use markets are made under subcontracts with original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), under their prime contracts with the U. S. Government. We had significant sales to Lockheed Martin Corporation (\u201cLockheed\u201d), Northrop Grumman Corporation (\u201cNorthrop\u201d), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (\u201cRaytheon\u201d) in 2020 in our defense technologies end-use market.\nOur customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products, or other difficulties in their business. In addition, shifts in government spending priorities have caused and may continue to cause additional uncertainty in the placement of orders.\nOur revenues from our top ten customers, which represented 61% of our total 2020 net revenues, were diversified over a number of different aerospace and defense products. Any significant change in production rates by these customers would have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows. There is no assurance that our current significant customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels, or that we will retain any or all of our existing customers, or that we will be able to form new relationships with customers upon the loss of one or more of our existing customers. This risk may be further\ncomplicated by pricing pressures, competition prevalent in our industry and other factors. A significant reduction in sales to any of our major customers, the loss of a major customer, or a default of a major customer on accounts receivable could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nBoeing was our largest customer prior to 2020 and remains one of our largest customers in 2020, and the 737 MAX was our highest revenue platform prior to 2020. Boeing recently received regulatory approval of the 737 MAX and as such, we expect to begin a modest ramp up in our production rates. Revenue growth with our other commercial customers and defense OEMs (also known as prime contractors) has helped to mitigate a significant portion of this risk for the time being. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has dampened civil air travel demand significantly, and if traveler confidence does not return in the near future, it may make it difficult to continue to offset a significant portion of this risk.\nWe generally make sales under purchase orders and contracts that are subject to cancellation, modification or rescheduling. Changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of the industries we serve could result in customer cancellation of contractual orders or requests for rescheduling. Some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to schedule and performance, and failure to deliver in accordance with such provisions could result in cancellations, modifications, rescheduling and/or penalties, in some cases at the customers\u2019 convenience and without prior notice. While we have normally recovered our direct and indirect costs plus profit, such cancellations, modifications, or rescheduling that cannot be replaced in a timely fashion, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nA significant portion of our business depends upon U.S. Government defense spending.\nWe derive a significant portion of our business from customers whose principal sales are to the U.S. Government. Accordingly, the success of our business depends upon government spending generally or for specific departments or agencies in particular. Such spending, among other factors, is subject to the uncertainties of governmental appropriations and national defense policies and priorities, constraints of the budgetary process, timing and potential changes in these policies and priorities, and the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations.\nThese and other factors could cause the government and government agencies, or prime contractors that use us as a subcontractor, to reduce their purchases under existing contracts, to exercise their rights to terminate contracts for convenience or to abstain from exercising options to renew contracts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, the levels of U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cU.S. DoD\u201d) spending in future periods are difficult to predict and are impacted by numerous factors such as the political environment, U.S. foreign policy, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. Government to enact relevant legislation such as the authorization and appropriations bills. The Budget Control Act (\u201c2011 Act\u201d) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. Government fiscal years. Accordingly, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. Government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to pressure.\nExports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and authorizations, and we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary U.S. Government approvals and related export licenses for proposed sales to certain foreign customers.\nWe must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the export of some of our products before we are permitted to sell those products outside the United States. Compliance often entails the submission and timely receipt of the necessary export approvals, licenses, or authorizations from the U.S. Government. Over the last several years, the U.S. export licensing environment for munitions has been adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the changing geopolitical environment and heightened tensions with other countries (which shift and evolve over time). Accordingly, we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, in a timely manner or at all, the approvals, licenses or authorizations we need to sell our products outside the United States, which may result in the cancellation of orders and significant penalties to our customers if we do not make deliveries and fulfill our contractual commitments. Any significant delay in, or impairment of, our ability to sell products outside of the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nContracts with some of our customers, including Federal government contracts, contain provisions which give our customers a variety of rights that are unfavorable to us and the OEMs to whom we provide products and services, including the ability to terminate a contract at any time for convenience.\nContracts with some of our customers, including Federal government contracts, contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts. These provisions may allow our customers to:\n\u2022terminate existing contracts, in whole or in part, for convenience, as well as for default, or if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;\n\u2022terminate existing contracts if we are suspended or debarred from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;\n\u2022prohibit future procurement awards with a particular agency as a result of a finding of an organizational conflict of interest based upon prior related work performed for the agency that would give a contractor an unfair advantage over competing contractors; and\n\u2022claim rights in products and systems produced by us.\nIf the U.S. Government terminates a contract for convenience, the counterparty with whom we have contracted on a subcontract may terminate its contract with us. As a result of any such termination, whether on a direct government contract or subcontract, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the U.S. Government terminates a direct contract with us for default, we may not even recover those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source.\nIn addition, the U.S. Government is typically required to open all programs to competitive bidding and, therefore, may not automatically renew any of its prime contracts. If one or more of our customers\u2019 government prime or subcontracts is terminated or canceled, our failure to replace sales generated from such contracts would result in lower sales and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther consolidation in the aerospace industry could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe aerospace and defense industry is experiencing significant consolidation, including our customers, competitors and suppliers. Consolidation among our customers may result in delays in the awarding of new contracts and losses of existing business. Consolidation among our competitors may result in larger competitors with greater resources and market share, which could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully. Consolidation among our suppliers may result in fewer sources of supply and increased cost to us.\nOur growth strategy includes evaluating selected acquisitions, which entails certain risks to our business and financial performance.\nWe have historically achieved a portion of our growth through acquisitions and expect to evaluate selected future acquisitions as part of our strategy for growth. Any acquisition of another business entails risks and it is possible that we may not realize the expected benefits from an acquisition or that an acquisition could adversely affect our existing operations. Acquisitions entail certain risks, including:\n\u2022difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company within our existing operations or in maintaining uniform standards;\n\u2022loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company;\n\u2022the failure to achieve anticipated synergies;\n\u2022unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations or that are not subject to indemnification or reimbursement by the seller; and\n\u2022management and other personnel having their time and resources diverted to evaluate, negotiate and integrate acquisitions.\nWe may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring, performance center consolidations, realignment, cost reduction, and other strategic initiatives.\nIn recent years, we have implemented a number of restructuring, realignment, and cost reduction initiatives, including performance center consolidations, organizational realignments, and reductions in our workforce. While we have realized some efficiencies from these actions, we may not realize the benefits of these initiatives to the extent we anticipated. Further, such benefits may be realized later than expected, and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated, which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions. In addition, if these measures are not successful or sustainable, we may have to undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in significant additional charges. Moreover, if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove ineffective, our ability to achieve our other strategic and business plan goals may be adversely impacted.\nAs we move up the value chain to become a more value added supplier, enhanced design, product development, manufacturing, supply chain project management and other skills will be required.\nWe may encounter difficulties as we execute our growth strategy to move up the value chain to become a more value added supplier of more complex assemblies. Difficulties we may encounter include, but are not limited to, the need for enhanced and expanded product design skills, enhanced ability to control and influence our suppliers, enhanced quality control systems and infrastructure, enhanced large-scale project management skills, and expanded industry certifications. Assuming incremental project design responsibilities would require us to assume additional risk in developing cost estimates and could expose us to increased risk of losses. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the enhanced skills required to move up the value chain or that our customers will outsource such functions to us.\nRisks associated with operating and conducting our business outside the United States could adversely impact us.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in Thailand and Mexico and also derive a portion of our net revenues from direct foreign sales. Further, our customers may derive portions of their revenues from non-U.S. customers. As a result, we are subject to the risks of conducting and operating our business internationally, including:\n\u2022political instability;\n\u2022economic and geopolitical developments and conditions;\n\u2022pandemics and disasters, natural or otherwise;\n\u2022compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies conducting business abroad, including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions;\n\u2022difficulties repatriating funds or restrictions on cash transfers; and\n\u2022potential for new tariffs imposed on imports by the U.S. administration.\nWhile the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, we believe any one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nCustomer pricing pressures could reduce the demand and/or price for our products and services.\nThe markets we serve are highly competitive and price sensitive. We compete worldwide with a number of domestic and international companies that have substantially greater manufacturing, purchasing, marketing and financial resources than we do. Many of our customers have the in-house capability to fulfill their manufacturing requirements. Our larger competitors may be able to compete more effectively for very large-scale contracts than we can by providing different or greater capabilities or benefits such as technical qualifications, past performance on large-scale contracts, geographic presence, price and availability of key professional personnel. If we are unable to successfully compete for new business, our net revenues growth and operating margins may decline.\nSeveral of our major customers have completed extensive cost containment efforts and we expect continued pricing pressures in 2021 and beyond. Competitive pricing pressures may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Further, there can be no assurance that competition from existing or potential competitors in other segments of our business will not have a material adverse effect on our financial results. If we do not continue to compete effectively and win contracts, our future business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations may be materially compromised.\nOur products and processes are subject to risk of obsolescence as a result of changes in technology and evolving industry and regulatory standards.\nThe future success of our business depends in large part upon our and our customers\u2019 ability to maintain and enhance technological capabilities, develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological advances in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis, while meeting evolving industry and regulatory standards. To address these risks, we invest in product design and development, and incur related capital expenditures. There can be no guarantee that our product design and development efforts will be successful, or that funds required to be invested in product design and development or incurred as capital expenditures will not increase materially in the future.\nWe may not have the ability to renew facilities leases on terms favorable to us and relocation of operations presents risks due to business interruption.\nCertain of our manufacturing facilities and offices are leased and have lease terms that expire between 2021 and 2026. The majority of these leases provide renewal options at the fair market rental rate at the time of renewal, which, if renewed, could be significantly higher than our current rental rates. We may be unable to offset these cost increases by charging more for our products and services. Furthermore, continued economic conditions may continue to negatively impact and create greater pressure in the commercial real estate market, causing higher incidences of landlord default and/or lender foreclosure of properties, including properties occupied by us. While we maintain certain non-disturbance rights in most cases, it is not certain that such rights will in all cases be upheld and our continued right of occupancy in such instances could be potentially jeopardized. An occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nAdditionally, if we choose to move any of our operations, those operations may be subject to additional relocation costs and associated risks of business interruption.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY, TAX, AND ACCOUNTING RISKS\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\nThe accuracy and appropriateness of certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for the U.S. Government contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, an arm of the U.S. DoD. Such audits and reviews could result in adjustments to our contract costs and profitability. However, we cannot ensure the outcome of any future audits and adjustments may be required to reduce net sales or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. If any audit or review were to uncover inaccurate costs or improper activities, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from conducting future business with the U.S. Government. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe are subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations. Our business and our reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with these laws.\nWe must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations, by us, our employees, or others working on our behalf, such as a supplier or a venture partner, could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to export products or services and civil or criminal investigations or proceedings.\nIn some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are different from those typically found in commercial transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our customers\u2019 government contracts and subcontracts either at its convenience or for default based on our performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss.\nOur operations are subject to numerous extensive, complex, costly and evolving laws, regulations and restrictions, including cybersecurity requirements, and failure to comply with these laws, regulations and restrictions could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.\nPrime contracts with our major customers that have contracts with various agencies of the U.S. Government are subject to numerous laws and regulations which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs to our business. As a result, our contracts and operations are subject to numerous, extensive, complex, costly and evolving laws, regulations and restrictions, principally by the U.S. Government or their agencies. These laws, regulations and restrictions govern items including, but not limited to, the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts, disclosure of cost and pricing data, civil penalties for violations of false claims to the U.S. Government for payment, defining reimbursable costs, establishing ethical standards for the procurement process, controlling the import and export of defense articles and services, and cybersecurity requirements.\nNoncompliance could expose us to liability for penalties, including termination of our contracts and subcontracts, disqualification from bidding on future U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting and various other fines and penalties. Noncompliance found by any one agency could result in fines,\npenalties, debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all U.S. Government agencies. Given our dependence on U.S. Government business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIn addition, the U.S. Government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations, at any time, including increased usage of fixed-price contracts, procurement reform, and compliance with cybersecurity requirements. Such changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or subcontracts or renew contracts or subcontracts under which we currently perform when those contracts are put up for competitive bidding. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future net revenues.\nIn addition, our international operations subject us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Changes in regulations or political environments may affect our ability to conduct business in foreign markets including investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in certain liabilities and could possibly result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nEnvironmental liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to various federal, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, storage, transport, discharge and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous chemicals and materials used and emissions generated during our manufacturing process. We do not carry insurance for these potential environmental liabilities. Any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to future liabilities or the suspension of production, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Moreover, some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can impose joint and several liability retroactively regardless of fault or the legality of the activities giving rise to the contamination. Compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations may require extensive capital expenditures, increase our cost or impact our production capabilities. Even if such expenditures are made, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply. We have been directed to investigate and take corrective action for groundwater contamination at certain sites and our ultimate liability for such matters will depend upon a number of factors. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K for further information.\nThe occurrence of litigation in which we could be named as a defendant is unpredictable.\nFrom time to time, we and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal and other proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business. While we believe no current proceedings, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, no assurances can be given. Any such claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nProduct liability claims in excess of insurance could adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nWe face potential liability for property damage, personal injury, or death as a result of the failure of products designed or manufactured by us. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance (including aircraft product liability insurance), any material product liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use estimates when bidding on fixed-price contracts. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe enter into contracts providing for a firm, fixed-price for the sale of a majority of our products, regardless of the production costs incurred by us. In many cases, we make multi-year firm, fixed-price commitments to our customers, without assurance that our anticipated production costs will be achieved. Contract bidding and accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract net sales and costs, including estimating cost increases over time and efficiencies to be gained, and making assumptions for supplier sourcing and quality, manufacturing scheduling and technical issues over the life of the contract. Such assumptions can be particularly difficult to estimate for contracts with new customers. Inaccurate estimates of these costs could result in reduced profits or incurred losses. Due to the significance of the judgments and estimates involved, it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Therefore, any changes in our underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nGoodwill and/or other assets could be impaired in the future, which could result in substantial charges.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of the first day of our fourth quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate potential impairment. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, management is required to make certain critical estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include projected sales levels, including the addition of new customers, programs or platforms and increased content on existing programs or platforms, improvements in manufacturing efficiency, and reductions in operating costs. Due to many variables inherent in the estimation of a business\u2019s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, changes in estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis. If any of these or other estimates and assumptions are not realized in the future, or if market multiples decline, we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill.\nWe also test intangible assets with indefinite life periods for potential impairment annually and on an interim basis if there are indicators of potential impairment.\nIn addition, we evaluate amortizable intangible assets, fixed assets, production cost of contracts, and lease right-of-use assets for impairment if there are indicators of a potential impairment.\nFurther, impairment charges may be incurred against other intangible assets or long-term assets if asset utilization declines, customer demand declines or other circumstances indicate that the asset carrying value may not be recoverable.\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 were $295.6 million, or 35% of total assets. If our goodwill and/or other assets are impaired, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\u201d in Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K for further information.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provision or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Furthermore, changes in income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. For example, we recorded provisional estimates of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) enacted in December 2017 in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d) in our 2017 consolidated financial statements. During 2018, these estimates were subject to further analysis and review which could have required adjustments, but no adjustments were required to be made in 2018. In addition, we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nOur ability to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud may be adversely affected if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective.\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate as a result of changed conditions, and fraud. Due to these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, our ability to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud could be adversely affected.\nLABOR AND SUPPLY CHAIN RISKS\nWe are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain key engineering, technical and managerial personnel, at both the executive and performance center level. We face competition for management, engineering and technical personnel from other companies and organizations. The loss of members of our senior management group, or key engineering and technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to grow and remain competitive in the future and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nLabor disruptions by our employees could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we employed 2,450 people. Two of our performance centers are parties to collective bargaining agreements, covering 155 full time hourly employees in one of those performance centers and 290 full time hourly employees in the other performance center, and will expire in June 2021 and April 2022, respectively. Although we have not experienced any material labor-related work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good, labor stoppages may occur in the future. If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements with the unions or if other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, higher ongoing labor costs and possible loss of customer contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on our suppliers to meet the quality and delivery expectations of our customers.\nOur ability to deliver our products and services on schedule and to satisfy specific quality levels is dependent upon a variety of factors, including execution of internal performance plans, availability of raw materials, internal and supplier produced parts and structures, conversion of raw materials into parts and assemblies, and performance of suppliers and others.\nWe rely on numerous third-party suppliers for raw materials and a large proportion of the components used in our production process. Certain of these raw materials and components are available only from single sources or a limited number of suppliers, or similarly, customers\u2019 specifications may require us to obtain raw materials and/or components from a single source or certain suppliers. Many of our suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources and manufacturing capabilities. We do not currently have the ability to manufacture these components ourselves. These and other factors, including import tariffs, the loss of a critical supplier or raw materials and/or component shortages, could cause disruptions or cost inefficiencies in our operations. Additionally, our competitors that have greater direct purchasing power, may have product cost advantages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nGENERAL RISKS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact but could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause significant volatility in financial markets, including the market price of our stock, and in the commercial aerospace industry during 2020, which has raised the prospect of an extended global recession. Public health problems resulting from COVID-19 and precautionary measures instituted by governments and businesses to mitigate its spread, including travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place directives, and shutting down of non-essential businesses has and continues to contribute to a general slowdown in the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and if it continues for an extended period of time, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and the businesses of our customers, suppliers and distribution partners, and could further disrupt our operations. Changes in our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or employee illnesses resulting from the pandemic, may result in inefficiencies or delays, including in sales and product development efforts and our manufacturing and supply chain, and additional costs related to business continuity initiatives, that cannot be fully mitigated through succession planning, employees working remotely, or teleconferencing technologies. The spread of COVID-19 along with related travel restrictions and operational issues has caused a decrease in the demand for air travel and has resulted in lower demand from civil aviation customers for our products. While the full extent and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated with certainty at this time, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business, the businesses of our customers and suppliers, as well as our results of operations and financial condition, and may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition in 2021 and beyond.\nCybersecurity attacks, internal system or service failures may adversely impact our business and operations.\nAny system or service disruptions, including those caused by projects to improve our information technology systems, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide products and related services to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, intruders or hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks. Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected information related to us or our products, our employees, customers or suppliers, or other acts that could lead to disruptions in our business. Any such failures could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our property and\nbusiness interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAssertions by third parties that we violated their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThird parties may claim that we, our customers, licensees, or parties indemnified by us are infringing upon or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours.\nAny claims that we violated a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights can be time consuming and costly to defend and distract management\u2019s attention and resources, even if the claims are without merit. Such claims may also require us to redesign affected products and services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or providing the affected products and services. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may not have sufficient financial resources or otherwise be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on favorable terms or cannot or do not substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nDamage or destruction of our facilities caused by storms, earthquake, fires or other causes could adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nWe have operations located in regions of the U.S. that may be exposed to damaging storms, earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters. Although we maintain standard property casualty insurance covering our properties and may be able to recover costs associated with certain natural disasters through insurance, we do not carry any earthquake insurance because of the cost of such insurance. Many of our properties are located in Southern California, an area subject to earthquake activity. Our California performance centers generated $178.6 million in net revenues during 2020. Even if covered by insurance, any significant damage or destruction of our facilities due to storms, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters could result in our inability to meet customer delivery schedules and may result in the loss of customers and significant additional costs to us. Thus, any significant damage or destruction of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
