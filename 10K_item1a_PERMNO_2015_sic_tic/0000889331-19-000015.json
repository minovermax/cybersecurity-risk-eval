RISK FACTORS.\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors it has identified below. Any of the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations. These factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance.\nThe Company\u2019s industry is subject to intense competitive pressures.\nThe Company operates in markets that are highly competitive. The Company competes on the basis of price, product performance and quality, service, and / or brand name across the industries and markets it serves. Competitive pressures could affect the prices the Company is able to charge its customers or demand for its products.\nThe Company may not always be able to compete on price, particularly when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater sales, financial and manufacturing resources and may have greater access to capital than the Company. As other companies enter its markets or develop new products, competition may further intensify. The Company\u2019s failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company engages in strategic acquisitions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions and / or may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses.\nThe Company seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions. In the past, the Company has acquired a number of businesses or companies and additional product lines and assets. The Company intends to continue to expand and diversify its operations with additional future acquisitions.\nAn acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to the Company\u2019s expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the Company\u2019s anticipated timetable. This could cause the Company\u2019s financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. The success of these transactions also depends on the Company\u2019s ability to integrate the assets, operations, and personnel associated with these acquisitions. The Company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with the Company\u2019s operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that are anticipated from an acquisition.\nThe Company may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets it acquires that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of the Company\u2019s due diligence review and its ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies acquired or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, the Company may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions may also result in recording of significant additional expenses to the results of operations and recording of substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nReorganization activities may lead to additional costs and material adverse effects.\nIn the past, the Company has taken actions to restructure and optimize its production and manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies through relocations, consolidations, plant closings or asset sales. In the future, the Company may take additional restructuring actions including the consolidating, closing or selling of additional facilities. These actions could result in impairment charges and various charges for such items as idle capacity, disposition costs and severance costs, in addition to normal or attendant risks and uncertainties. The Company may be unsuccessful in any of its current or future efforts to restructure or consolidate its business. Plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during restructuring or consolidation may not be achieved. These activities may have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to its customers\u2019 needs.\nThe end markets for the Company\u2019s products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render its existing products obsolete and unmarketable before it can recover any or all of its research, development, and commercialization expenses on capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of its products may change and are difficult to estimate.\nThe Company\u2019s future success will depend upon its ability to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to its customers\u2019 needs. The Company will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated requirements of its customers. The Company invests heavily in research and development without knowing that it will recover these costs. The Company\u2019s competitors may develop products or technologies that will render its products non-competitive or obsolete. If it cannot develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to manage currency or commodity price fluctuations or supply shortages is limited.\nAs a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, the Company is exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. The Company has multiple sources of supply for the majority of its commodity requirements. However, significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price increases could affect prices the Company charges its customers, its product costs, and the competitive position of its products and services. The Company monitors and manages these exposures as an integral part of its overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on its results. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted. In addition, because of intense price competition and the Company\u2019s high level of fixed costs, it may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable. Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, significant portions of its revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates. As it operates in multiple foreign currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact its revenues and expenses. The impact of possible currency devaluation in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact the Company\u2019s results and financial guidance. For additional discussion of interest rate, currency or commodity price risk, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors, including interpretations and administrative guidance in regard to the Tax Act (defined below), U.S. and/or international tax legislation, mix of the Company\u2019s earnings by jurisdiction, and U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictional tax audits.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). Although certain administrative guidance has been issued, the appropriate application of many provisions of the Tax Act remain uncertain. As discussed more fully in Note 14, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, adjustments to income tax expense may be necessary in future periods if provisions of the Tax Act, and their interaction with other provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, are interpreted differently than interpretations made by the Company, whether through issuance of additional administrative guidance, or through further review of the Tax Act by the Company and its advisors. Such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Therefore, it is subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s income tax rate in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions is substantially lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. Legislative proposals have been made from time to time to reduce these tax benefits, in some cases with the tax increase phased in over a multi-year transition period. In addition, certain non-U.S. jurisdictions are considering tax legislation\nbased upon recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in connection with its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting study. The outcome of these and other legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and cash flows.\nThe tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which the Company operates vary widely. Therefore, the Company\u2019s effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of its earnings by jurisdiction.\nThe Company\u2019s tax returns are subject to examination by various U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. However, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe U.S. government has adopted a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It has also imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods and products. These measures may materially increase costs for goods imported into the United States. This in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we do not or are unable to increase prices, could result in lower margins on products sold. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted in, and could result in more, U.S. trading partners adopting responsive trade policies making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries.\nA decline in expected profitability of the Company or individual reporting units of the Company could result in the impairment of assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets.\nThe Company holds material amounts of goodwill and other long-lived assets on its balance sheet. A decline in expected profitability, particularly if there is a decline in the global economy, could call into question the recoverability of the Company\u2019s related goodwill and other long-lived tangible and intangible assets and require the write down or write off of these assets. Such an occurrence has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nA significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the Company's revenue and earnings.\nAlthough the Company's financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, the majority of the Company\u2019s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries. The Company\u2019s most significant net long exposure is to the euro. The Company\u2019s most significant net short exposures are to the Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, and Philippine peso. Changes in foreign exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues may vary significantly from period to period.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues may vary significantly from one accounting period to another due to a variety of factors including:\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 buying decisions;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for its products;\n\u2022\nchanges in its distributor inventory stocking;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s product mix;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\ncosts and timing of its component purchases;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of its inventory control;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which it is able to utilize its available manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to meet delivery schedules;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlocal conditions and events that may affect its production volumes, such as labor conditions and political instability; and\n\u2022\nseasonality of certain product lines.\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could adversely affect the Company.\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could result in lower sales revenue and cause a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major auto\nmanufacturer or significant supplier likely could lead to substantial disruptions in the automotive supply base, resulting in lower demand for the Company\u2019s products, which likely would cause a decrease in sales revenue and have a substantial adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is exposed to political, economic, and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.\nThe Company has significant operating activities in numerous countries around the globe that contribute significantly to its revenues and earnings. Sales to customers outside the United States constituted approximately 70% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2018. Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global marketplace requires the Company to place its production in countries outside the U.S., including emerging markets, to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost-efficient structure. In addition, the Company sources a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third-party suppliers in low-cost countries. The Company\u2019s operating activities are subject to a number of risks generally associated with multi-national operations, including risks relating to the following:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations and exchange restrictions;\n\u2022\nimport and export duties and restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of tariffs and other import or export barriers;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulations governing import and export activities;\n\u2022\ncurrent and changing regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse income tax consequences;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\nterrorist activities;\n\u2022\npublic health concerns;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on the Company\u2019s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the Company\u2019s manufacturing, supply or distribution chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nThe Company sources materials and sell product through various international network channels. A disruption could occur within the Company\u2019s manufacturing, distribution or supply chain network. This could include damage or destruction due to various causes including natural disasters or political instability which would cause one or more of these network channels to become non-operational. This could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to manufacture or deliver its products in a timely manner, impair its ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to its reputation. Such a disruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to invest in its businesses, make strategic acquisitions, and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. If the Company is unable to access the capital markets or bank credit facilities, it could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFixed costs may reduce operating results if sales fall below expectations.\nThe Company\u2019s expense levels are based, in part, on its expectations for future sales. Many of the Company\u2019s expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed. The Company might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales. Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe volatility of the Company\u2019s stock price could affect the value of an investment in the Company\u2019s stock and future financial position.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s stock can fluctuate widely. Between December 30, 2017 and December 29, 2018, the closing sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock ranged between a low of $155.15 and a high of $238.11. The volatility of the stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as volatility in the financial markets, general macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, analysts\u2019 expectations concerning the Company\u2019s results of operations, or the volatility of its revenues as discussed above under \u201cThe Company\u2019s Revenues May Vary Significantly from Period to Period.\u201d The historic market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may not be indicative of future market prices. The Company may not be able to sustain or increase the value of its common stock. Declines in the market price of the Company\u2019s stock could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to retain personnel with stock incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future financing activities with or involving the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company is exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to its information technology systems and data security.\nThe Company relies on its information technology systems and networks in connection with many of its business activities. Some of these networks and systems are managed directly by the Company, while others are managed by third-party service providers and are not under the Company\u2019s direct control. The Company\u2019s operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees, and other sensitive matters. As with most companies, the Company has experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach its systems, and other similar incidents, none of which have been material. Any future cyber incidents could, however, materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding employees or customers or other third parties; and jeopardize the security of the Company\u2019s facilities. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption, and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware, and other cyber-attacks are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject the Company to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage the Company\u2019s reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. The Company continuously seeks to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be interrupted by labor disputes or other interruptions of supplies.\nA work stoppage could occur at certain Company facilities, most likely as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements. In addition, the Company may experience a shortage of supplies for various reasons, such as financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters or production difficulties that may affect one of its suppliers. A significant work stoppage, or an interruption or shortage of supplies for any reason, if protracted, could substantially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The transfer of the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations and changes in its distribution model could disrupt operations for a limited time.\nFailure to attract and retain qualified personnel could affect the Company\u2019s business results.\nThe Company\u2019s success, both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions, depends on the Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain, and motivate a highly-skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that the Company has the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience could impede its ability to deliver growth objectives and execute the Company\u2019s strategy. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily upon engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to conduct research activities successfully and develop marketable products.\nEnvironmental liabilities could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial position.\nForeign, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in the Company\u2019s manufacturing processes or in its finished goods. These environmental regulations have required the Company to expend a portion of its resources and capital on relevant compliance programs. Under these laws and regulations, the Company could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if its current or former properties are contaminated or if it sends waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if the Company did not cause\nthe contamination. The Company may be subject to additional common law claims if it releases substances that damage or harm third parties. In addition, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs. Any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations could subject the Company to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the conduct of manufacturing operations, the Company has handled and does handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state, and local laws. The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated. In addition, the Company operates or owns facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others. Certain of these properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials. Contaminants may migrate from, within or through these properties. These releases or migrations may give rise to claims. Where third parties are responsible for contamination, the third parties may not have funds, or not make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed upon the Company under environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company is responsible for the maintenance of discontinued coal mining operations in Germany. The risk of environmental remediation exists and the Company is in the process of remediating the mines considered to be the most at risk.\nCustomer demands and regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force the Company to incur additional expenses.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires disclosure of use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals. In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d metals, the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, the Company may face challenges with its customers and suppliers if it is unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in its products are \u201cconflict free.\u201d\nThe Company may not be successful protecting its patents and trademarks.\nThe Company considers its intellectual property, including patents, trade names, and trademarks, to be of significant value to its business as a whole. The Company\u2019s products are manufactured, marketed, and sold under a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire or are allowed to lapse at various dates in the future. The Company develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and considers all of its intellectual property to be valuable. The Company's policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the great majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements. Based on the broad scope of its product lines, the Company believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material adverse effect upon its business, financial condition or results of operations; however, multiple losses or expirations could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 77918, "SIC": 3613, "TIC": "LFUS"}
