{"cik": "1143155", "company": "HAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our Common Stock involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our Common Stock. In addition to the other information contained in this report, the following risks may affect us. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements about our future plans, objectives, intentions, and expectations. Past results are not a reliable indicator of future results, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Many factors, including those described below, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur success is largely dependent on attracting and retaining key management team members.\nWe are a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. Future growth is expected to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with customers. While we have assembled an experienced and talented senior management team, maintaining this team, while at the same time developing other managers and/or attracting new talent in order that management succession can be achieved, is not assured. The unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and may result in lower revenues or reduced earnings.\nIn September 2015, Douglas J. Glenn resigned as Chief Executive Officer, and we announced the appointment of Charles M. Johnston, Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors, to serve as the interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company while the Company conducts a search for Mr. Glenn's replacement. Any significant leadership change or executive management transition involves inherent risk, and we could experience disruptions in our executive management transition, or any executive management transition that may occur in the future, which could hinder our strategic planning, execution and future performance.\nWe are not paying dividends on our Common Stock currently and absent regulatory approval are prevented from doing so. The failure to resume paying dividends on our Common Stock may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe paid cash dividends on our Common Stock prior to the third quarter of 2009. During the third quarter of 2009, we suspended dividend payments. Absent permission from the Virginia State Corporation Commission, BOHR may pay dividends to us only to the extent of positive accumulated retained earnings. The retained deficit of BOHR, our principal banking subsidiary, was $362.3 million as of December 31, 2015. It is unlikely in the foreseeable future that we would be able to pay dividends if BOHR cannot pay dividends to us. As a result, there is no assurance if or when we will be able to resume paying cash dividends.\nIn addition, all dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and are dependent upon our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, regulatory capital requirements, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The ability of our banking subsidiary to pay dividends to us is also limited by obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to our banking subsidiary. If we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements, we are unable to pay dividends on our Common Stock.\nWe incurred significant losses from 2009 to 2012. While we returned to profitability in 2013 and continued to be profitable during 2014 and 2015, we can make no assurances that will continue. An inability to improve our profitability could adversely affect our operations and our capital levels.\nSince the beginning of the \"Great Recession\", many of our loan customers have operated in an economically challenging environment, however, the markets in which we operate have begun to experience generally more stable business conditions. Generally, the levels of loan delinquencies and defaults have continued to decline over the last several years, although they continue to be higher than historical levels. Also during the last several years, our net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, has not grown due to a historically low interest rate environment.\nOur net income attributable to Hampton Roads Bankshares, Inc. was $93.0 million, $9.3 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, but our net loss attributable to Hampton Roads Bankshares, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $25.1 million. There is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain this improvement in our net income. In addition to the risk that the broader economic conditions will stagnate or reverse their improvements, our mortgage banking earnings are particularly volatile due to their dependence upon the direction and level of mortgage interest rates.\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nOur mortgage banking earnings are cyclical and sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur mortgage banking earnings are dependent upon our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors. Loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. A significant portion of increases in our mortgage banking earnings over the last few years was due to historically low interest rate environment that resulted in a high volume of mortgage loan refinancing activity. During 2015, 34% of our mortgage loan production was related to refinancing activity. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 0.25% to 0.50%. Should the Federal Reserve continue on a path of raising short term interest rates, there may be a negative impact to our production of mortgage loans. Loan production levels may also suffer if we experience a slowdown in the local housing market or tightening credit conditions. Any sustained period of decreased activity caused by fewer refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce our income from mortgage banking activities. As a result, these conditions would also adversely affect our results of operations.\nEconomic, market, or operational developments may negatively impact our ability to maintain required capital levels or otherwise negatively impact our financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2015, BOHR was classified as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for regulatory capital purposes. However, impairments to our loan or securities portfolio, declines in our earnings or a combination of these or other factors could change our capital position in a relatively short period of time. If BOHR is unable to remain \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d it will not be able to renew or accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval or offer interest rates on deposit accounts that are significantly higher than the average rates in its market area. As a result, it would be more difficult for us to attract new deposits as our existing brokered deposits mature and do not rollover and to retain or increase non-brokered deposits. If we are not able to attract new deposits, our ability to fund our loan portfolio may be adversely affected. In addition, any negative impact to our capital position may cause the Bank to have to pay higher insurance premiums to the FDIC, which will reduce our earnings.\nVirginia law and the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could deter or prevent takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our Common Stock that would be willing to pay you a premium for your shares of our Common Stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as well as the Company\u2019s Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d), contain provisions that may be deemed to have the effect of discouraging or delaying uninvited attempts by third parties to gain control of the Company. These provisions include the ability of our board to set the price, term, and rights of, and to issue, one or more series of our preferred stock. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws do not provide for the ability of stockholders to call special meetings.\nSimilarly, the Virginia Stock Corporation Act contains provisions designed to protect Virginia corporations and employees from the adverse effects of hostile corporate takeovers. These provisions reduce the possibility that a third party could affect a change in control without the support of our incumbent directors. These provisions may also strengthen the position of current management by restricting the ability of shareholders to change the composition of the board, to affect its policies generally, and to benefit from actions that are opposed by the current board.\nOur ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the economic environment which may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations.\nThe management of liquidity risk is critical to the management of our business and to our ability to service our customer base. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. In managing our balance sheet, a primary source of funding is customer deposits. Our ability to continue to attract these deposits and other funding sources is subject to variability based upon a number of factors including volume and volatility in the securities markets and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities. Our potential inability to maintain adequate sources of funding may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations.\nAn inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investments or loans, the issuance of equity and debt securities, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include operating losses; rising levels of non-performing assets; a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans or deposits are concentrated or as a result of a loss of confidence in us by our customers, lenders, and/or investors; or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial industry.\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nThe availability and level of deposits and other funding sources, including borrowings and the issuance of equity and debt securities, is highly dependent upon the perception of the liquidity and creditworthiness of the financial institution, and such perception can change quickly in response to market conditions or circumstances unique to a particular company. Concerns about our financial condition or concerns about our credit exposure to other persons could adversely impact our sources of liquidity, financial position, regulatory capital ratios, results of operations, and our business prospects.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.\nWe face vigorous competition from other banks and other financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies, and credit unions for deposits, loans, and other financial services that serve our market area. A number of these banks and other financial institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems, and offer a wider array of banking services. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us. As a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. While we believe we compete effectively with these other financial institutions serving our primary markets, we may face a competitive disadvantage to larger institutions. If we have to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively, our net interest margin and income could be negatively affected. Failure to compete effectively to attract new clients or to retain existing clients may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, growth, and the market price of our Common Stock.\nSales, or the perception that sales could occur, of large amounts of our Common Stock by our institutional investors may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our Common Stock could drop if our existing shareholders decide to sell their shares. As of December 31, 2015, Anchorage, CapGen, and Carlyle owned 24.78%, 29.82%, and 24.78%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. Pursuant to the various definitive investment agreements that we have entered into with these shareholders, the Company has an effective registration statement covering the resale of shares of our Common Stock by each of the shareholders listed above. These shareholders could utilize this registration statement by reselling the shares of our Common Stock they currently hold. If any of these shareholders sell large amounts of our Common Stock, or other investors perceive such sales to be imminent, the market price of our Common Stock could drop significantly. In addition, at December 31, 2015, we have an estimated $295.9 million of tax net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to be carried forward, and the ability to utilize our NOLs is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 382 generally restricts the use of NOLs after an \u201cownership change.\u201d An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the shareholders (or specified groups of shareholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock or are otherwise treated as 5% shareholders under Section 382 and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder because of an increase of their aggregate percentage ownership of that corporation\u2019s stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these shareholders over a rolling three-year period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carryforwards. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of the corporation\u2019s stock on the date of the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOL carryforwards. We do not believe that the 2012 capital raise caused an \u201cownership change\u201d at the Company within the meaning of Section 382. However, the capital raise, in conjunction with prior recapitalization efforts, resulted in Anchorage, CapGen and Carlyle owning a substantial portion of our stock, which reduces our ability to engage in future acquisition activity involving entities of similar or greater size than the Company without undergoing an \u201cownership change.\u201d Thus, any acquisition activity in which the Company may engage would require the Company to evaluate whether an \u201cownership change\u201d would occur. Given the level of merger and acquisition activity in our market, we cannot ensure that our ability to use our NOLs to offset income will not become limited in the future. As a result, we could pay taxes earlier and in larger amounts than would be the case if our NOLs were available to reduce our federal income taxes without restriction.\nThe concentration of our loan portfolio continues to be in real estate - commercial mortgage, equity line lending, and construction, which may expose us to greater risk of loss.\nOur business strategy centers, in part, on offering real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line loans secured by real estate in order to generate interest income. These types of loans generally have higher yields due to an elevated risk profile compared to traditional one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015 real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line lending totaled $648.5 million and $120.2 million, respectively. These loan categories combined represented 49.9% of total\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nloans. Such loans increase our credit risk profile relative to other financial institutions that have lower concentrations of real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line loans.\nLoans secured by real estate - commercial mortgage properties are generally for larger amounts than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Payments on loans secured by these properties generally are dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans is subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. While we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.\nEquity line lending allows a customer to access an amount up to their line of credit for the term specified in their agreement. At the expiration of the term of an equity line, a customer may have the entire principal balance outstanding as opposed to a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan where the principal is disbursed entirely at closing and amortizes throughout the term of the loan. We cannot predict when and to what extent our customers will access their equity lines. Often, the equity line's security position is in a subordinate collateral position. While we seek to minimize this risk in a variety of ways, including attempting to employ conservative underwriting criteria, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.\nOur loan portfolio contains loans used to finance construction and land development. Construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction, the marketability of the property, and the bid price and estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. If the estimate of the value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment. When lending to builders, the cost of construction breakdown is provided by the builder, as well as supported by the appraisal. Although our underwriting criteria were designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each construction loan, there can be no guarantee that these practices will have safeguarded against material delinquencies and losses to our operations.\nAt December 31, 2015 we had loans of $141.2 million or 9.2% of total loans outstanding to finance construction and land development. Construction and land development loans are dependent on the successful completion of the projects they finance, however, in many cases such construction and development projects in our primary market areas are not being completed in a timely manner, if at all. A portion of our residential and real estate - commercial mortgage lending is secured by vacant or unimproved land. Loans secured by vacant or unimproved land are generally more risky than loans secured by improved property for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Since vacant or unimproved land is generally held by the borrower for investment purposes or future use, payments on loans secured by vacant or unimproved land will typically rank lower in priority to the borrower than a loan the borrower may have on their primary residence or business. These loans are more susceptible to adverse conditions in the real estate market and local economy.\nGeneral economic conditions in the markets in which we do business may decline and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe local economies where the Company does business are heavily reliant on military spending and may be adversely impacted by significant cuts to such spending that might result from recent Congressional budgetary enactments. Real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions, including, among other things, changes in general or regional economic conditions, government rules or policies, and natural disasters. With 82.0% of our loans concentrated in the regions of Hampton Roads, Richmond, the Eastern Shore of Virginia, and the Research Triangle and Northeast North Carolina regions, a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans. A decline in property values could diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral, making it more likely that we would suffer additional losses on defaulted loans and/or foreclosed properties by requiring additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses. Also, a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions whose real estate portfolios are more geographically diverse. While our policy is to obtain updated appraisals on a periodic basis, there are no assurances that we may be able to realize the amount indicated in the appraisal upon disposition of the underlying property. We take into account all available information in assessing the fair value of other real estate owned and repossessed assets, including pending offers, recent appraisals, and other indicators. However, differences may exist between our estimate of fair value and the amount we ultimately realize upon sale, and such differences could be material.\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nWe have had large numbers of problem loans. Although problem loans have declined significantly, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so.\nOur non-performing assets ratio, defined as the ratio of loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets to gross loans plus loans held for sale plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets was 2.98% and 2.95% at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. On December 31, 2015, 0.33% of our loans was 30 to 89 days delinquent and treated as performing assets. The administration of non-performing loans is an important function in attempting to mitigate any future losses related to our non-performing assets.\nThe determination of the appropriate balance of our allowance for loan losses is merely an estimate of the inherent risk of loss in our existing loan portfolio and may prove to be incorrect. If such estimate is proven to be materially incorrect and we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our Common Stock could be materially adversely affected.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to our expenses that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses within our existing portfolio of loans. Our allowance for loan losses was $23.2 million at December 31, 2015, which represented 1.50% of our total loans, as compared to $27.1 million, or 1.90% of total loans, at December 31, 2014. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s estimates and judgments as to specific credit risks, evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political, and regulatory conditions, and incurred but unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. For further discussion on the impact continued weak economic conditions have on the collateral underlying our loan portfolio, see above section \u201cGeneral economic conditions in the markets in which we do business may decline and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses of loans. Such agencies may require us to recognize additional losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Furthermore, certain proposed changes to GAAP, if implemented as proposed, may require us to increase our estimate for losses embedded in our loan portfolio, resulting in an adverse impact to our results of operations and level of regulatory capital. Accordingly, the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover loan losses or significant increases to the allowance for loan losses may be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen. Any such increases in the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur profitability will be jeopardized if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.\nOur profitability depends in substantial part upon the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. These rates are normally in line with general market rates and rise and fall based on management\u2019s view of our needs. Changes in interest rates will affect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways including the prices of securities, loans and deposits, and the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business, and could result in decreases to our earnings. Our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments. This could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may face increasing deposit-pricing pressures, which may, among other things, reduce our profitability.\nDeposit pricing pressures may result from competition as well as changes to the interest rate environment. There is intense competition for deposits. The competition has had an impact on interest rates paid to attract deposits as well as fees charged on deposit products. In addition to the competitive pressures from other depository institutions, we face heightened competition from non-depository financial products such as securities, other alternative investments, and technology-based savings vehicles. Furthermore, technology and other market changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds for investing purposes. Bank customers also have greater access to deposit vehicles that facilitate spreading deposit balances among different depository institutions to maximize FDIC insurance coverage.\nIn addition to competitive forces, we also are at risk from market forces as they affect interest rates. It is not uncommon when interest rates transition from a low interest rate environment to a rising rate environment for deposit and other funding costs to rise in advance\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nof yields on earning assets. In order to keep deposits required for funding purposes, it may be necessary to raise deposit rates without commensurate increases in asset pricing in the short term.\nWe face a variety of threats from technology-based frauds and scams.\nFinancial institutions are a prime target of criminal activities through various channels of information technology. We attempt to mitigate risk from such activities through policies, procedures, and preventative and detective measures. Although the Company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Company\u2019s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, as well as its intellectual property, and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Company and its customers, the Company\u2019s security measures do not provide absolute security.\nIn fact, many financial services institutions, retailers and other companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means.\nThird parties with which the Company does business or that facilitate its business activities, including exchanges, clearinghouses, payment and ATM networks, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or technology solutions for the Company\u2019s operations, could also be sources of operational and security risks to the Company, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by their employees or cyber-attacks that could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Company or result in lost or compromised information of the Company or its customers.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage designed to provide a level of financial protection to our business risks posed by business interruption, fraud losses, business recovery expenses, and other potential losses or expenses that may be experienced from a significant event are not readily predictable and, therefore, could have an impact on our results of operations.\nOur operations and customers might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in our market area.\nBecause a substantial portion of our loans are with customers and businesses located in the central and coastal portions of Virginia, North Carolina, and Maryland, catastrophic events, including natural disasters such as hurricanes which have historically struck the east coast of the United States with some regularity, or terrorist attacks, could disrupt our operations. Any of these natural disasters or other catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our financial centers and customer base as well as collateral values and the strength of our loan portfolio. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us could have a material adverse impact on our operations and the market price of our Common Stock.\nRisks Relating to Market, Legislative, and Regulatory Events\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are highly regulated and could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities.\nCurrent economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. Government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. Compliance with increased government regulation may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. The increased costs associated with anticipated regulatory and political scrutiny could adversely impact our results of operations.\nNew proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations and/or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We cannot predict whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and impact of any such new legislation on us. Additional regulation could affect us in a substantial way and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nBanking regulators have broad enforcement power, but regulations are meant to protect depositors and not investors.\nWe are subject to supervision by several governmental regulatory agencies. The regulators\u2019 interpretation and application of relevant regulations are beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably, and can be expected to influence our earnings and growth. In addition, if we do not comply with regulations that are applicable to us, we could be subject to regulatory penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAll such government regulations may limit our growth and the return to our investors by restricting activities such as the payment of dividends, mergers with, or acquisitions by, other institutions, investments, loans and interest rates, interest rates paid on deposits, the use of brokered deposits, and the creation of financial centers. Although these regulations impose costs on us, they are intended to protect depositors. The regulations to which we are subject may not always be in the best interests of investors.\nThe fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies of the Federal Government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine, in large part, the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. It also can materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities. Its policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans.\nIn addition, as a public company we are subject to securities laws and standards imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Because we are a relatively small company, the costs of compliance are disproportionate compared with much larger organizations. Continued growth of legal and regulatory compliance mandates could adversely affect our expenses, future results of operations, and the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, the government and regulatory authorities have the power to impose rules or other requirements, including requirements that we are unable to anticipate, that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and the market price of our Common Stock.\nGovernment legislation and regulation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. The Dodd-Frank Act makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rule-making. In addition, the law mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. The Dodd-Frank Act has and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness for the financial services sector. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have begun to be or will be implemented over the next few years and will be subject to further rule-making and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies. Because the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend on future regulatory rule-making and interpretation, we cannot predict the full effect of this legislation on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Dodd-Frank Act has indeed increased our operating costs of compliance and has increased the amount of capital we are required to maintain. For further discussion of these issues, see the \u201cGovernment Supervision and Regulation\u201d section found in Item 1 of this document.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry, generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of, or market for, our Common Stock.\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of numerous conditions, and the Merger may not be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all.\nEach of our and Xenith\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger remains subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, the following, as further described in the Merger Agreement: (1) approval of the Merger by Xenith\u2019s shareholders and our shareholders (2) authorization for listing on NASDAQ of the shares of our common stock to be issued in the Merger, (3) the receipt of required regulatory approvals, including with respect to distributions of cash to the surviving corporation from BOHR and/or Xenith Bank immediately prior to the closing (unless waived by the parties), (4) effectiveness of the registration statement the shares of our common stock to be issued in the Merger, (5) the absence of any order, injunction or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the Merger or making the completion of the Merger illegal, (6) the receipt of a tax opinion that an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code has not occurred with respect to the Company in the three years prior to and including the closing of the Merger, (7) subject to the materiality standards provided in the Merger Agreement, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company and Xenith in the Merger Agreement, (8) performance in all material respects by each of us and Xenith of its obligations under the Merger Agreement, (9) receipt by each of us and Xenith of an opinion from its counsel as to certain tax matters and (10) the adjusted shareholders\u2019 equity of each of us and Xenith meeting certain minimum thresholds as provided in the Merger Agreement. There is no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied, or that the Merger will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe. Further, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that the Merger will be completed. See the risk factor entitled \u201cIf the Merger is not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses and committed substantial time and resources without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger\u201d below.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger.\nBefore the Merger and the Bank Merger may be completed, we and Xenith must obtain approvals from the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Financial Institutions, including with respect to contemplated distributions of cash to the surviving corporation from BOHR and/or Xenith Bank immediately prior to the closing (unless waived by the parties), and from any regulatory authority required to issue the Merger consideration to the shareholders of Xenith as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. In determining whether to grant these approvals the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. An adverse development in either party\u2019s regulatory standing or other factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their receipt. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger or the Bank Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger or the Bank Merger. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Merger or the Bank Merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger and the Bank Merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger. In addition, the contemplated distributions of cash to the surviving corporation from BOHR and/or Xenith Bank immediately prior to the closing may not be approved by the required regulatory authorities, or may be approved only in part and not in the full contemplated amount of $20 million.\nCombining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized.\nWe and Xenith have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the Merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses our company and Xenith in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our common stock. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause us and/or Xenith to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from us and/or Xenith and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on us during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Merger on the combined company. In addition, the actual cost savings of the\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nMerger could be less than anticipated, and we may be unable to realize or utilize our deferred tax assets within expected time frames or at all, or in the amounts currently anticipated following completion of the Merger.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement, or failure to complete the Merger, could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences. For example, our businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. Additionally, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay to Xenith a termination fee of $4 million.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us. Retention of certain employees by us may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us, our business could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, we have agreed to operate our business in the ordinary course prior to closing, and we have agreed to certain restrictive covenants.\nIf the Merger is not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses and committed substantial time and resources without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger.\nWe have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing a joint proxy statement/prospectus and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Merger. Matters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) also will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other potentially advantageous business opportunities or plans that may have been beneficial to us. If the Merger is not completed, we would have to recognize these expenses and would have committed substantial time and resources, without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger. In addition, failure to consummate the Merger also may result in negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, vendors and employees. If the Merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price, business and cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe combined company may not be able to realize our deferred income tax assets.\nWe have substantial deferred tax assets that can generally be utilized to offset our future taxable income and, under certain circumstances, the combined company after the consummation of the Merger. If we or the combined company were to undergo a change in ownership of more than 50% of its capital stock over a three year period as measured under Section 382 of the Code, the ability to utilize such deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income would be substantially limited. The annual limit would generally equal the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of the relevant entity\u2019s capital stock immediately before the ownership change. These changes of ownership rules generally focus on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of a company\u2019s outstanding stock, including certain public groups of stockholders as set forth under Section 382, and those arising from new stock issuances and other equity transactions. The determination of whether an ownership change occurs is complex and not entirely within our or the combined company\u2019s control. It is a condition to each party\u2019s obligation to complete the Merger that we receive an accountant\u2019s opinion that an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code has not occurred with respect to the Company in the three years prior to and including the closing of the Merger.\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.", "PERMNO": 91431, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "XBKS"}
