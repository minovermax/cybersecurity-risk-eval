Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. These risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report or elsewhere.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse affect on our results of operations.\nThe self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material affect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use, zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets.\nWe are highly leveraged.\nAs of March 31, 2016, we had total debt outstanding of $2,688.8 million and total undiscounted operating lease commitments of $157.0 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations:\nrequire us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service and operating lease payments;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing; and\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt and operating leases depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, including our operating leases, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt or leases that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nEconomic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nConsumer and commercial spending is generally affected by the health of the economy, which places some of the factors affecting the success of our business beyond our control. Our businesses, although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of, declines, or sustained lack of recovery, in general economic conditions. In times of declining consumer spending we may be driven, along with our competitors, to reduce pricing which would have a negative impact on gross profit. We cannot predict if another downturn, or sustained lack of recovery, in the economy will occur, which could result in reduced revenues and working capital.\nShould credit markets in the United States tighten or if interest rates increase significantly, we may not be able to refinance existing debt or find additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities. If our operating results were to worsen significantly and our cash flows or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions.\nTo meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could lead us to operate trucks longer than initially planned and/or reduce the size of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations.\nAnother important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment. The sale of used equipment provides us with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment. Conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in demand and/or resale values for our used equipment. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, which could result in substantial losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment.\nWe obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers.\nOver the last twenty years, we purchased the majority of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Our fleet can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers may face within their own supply chain. Also, it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders or fulfill existing orders. The cost of acquiring new rental trucks could increase materially and negatively affect our ability to rotate new equipment into the fleet. Although we believe that we could contract with alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks, we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take. In addition, termination of our existing relationship with these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time.\nWe may not be able to effectively hedge against interest rate changes in our variable debt.\nIn certain instances, the Company seeks to manage its exposure to interest rate risk through the use of hedging instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps. We enter into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on their obligations. Additionally, a failure on our part to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are required to record these financial instruments at their fair value. Changes in interest rates can significantly impact the valuation of the instruments resulting in non-cash changes to our financial position.\nA substantial amount of our shares is owned by a small contingent of stockholders.\nWillow Grove Holdings LP, James P. Shoen, David L. Holmes as trustee, Rosemarie T. Donovan as trustee, Mark V. Shoen and Edward J. Shoen, directly and through controlled entities as applicable (collectively, the \u201cReporting Persons\u201d) are parties to a stockholder agreement (the \u201cStockholder Agreement\u201d) in which the Reporting Persons have agreed to vote their collective 10,898,124 shares (approximately 55.6%) of AMERCO common stock as one group, as provided in the Stockholder Agreement. Pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement, all such 10,898,124 shares are required to be voted at the direction of a majority in interest of the Reporting Persons. For additional information, refer to the Schedule 13Ds filed on July 13, 2006, March 9, 2007, June 26, 2009, May 1, 2013, December 17, 2015 and on February 12, 2016 with the SEC.\nIn December 2015, each of James P. Shoen, Rosemarie Donovan as trustee, and David L. Holmes as trustee provided written notice that they intend to withdraw their shares, constituting a total of 2,538,622 shares, from the Stockholder Agreement on June 30, 2016. James P. Shoen, Rosemarie T. Donovan and David L. Holmes shall remain subject to the Stockholder Agreement until the effective date of such withdrawal, which is expected to occur before our next annual meeting of stockholders. The withdrawal of such shares from the Stockholder Agreement will result in us no longer being a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d pursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules as of July 1, 2016. However, Willow Grove Holdings, LP, directly and through controlled entities, owns 8,307,584 shares of AMERCO common stock, and together with Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, owns 8,359,502 shares (approximately 42.6%) of AMERCO common stock. Accordingly, Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, brothers, are in a position to significantly influence our business and policies, including the approval of certain significant transactions, the election of the members of our Board of Directors and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their interests will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nIn addition, 1,232,753 shares (approximately 6.3%) of AMERCO common stock is owned under our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\u201cESOP\u201d). Each ESOP participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion. In the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee\u2019s discretion.\nWe bear certain risks related to our notes receivable from SAC Holding.\nAt March 31, 2016, we held a $49.3 million note receivable from SAC Holding, which consists of a junior unsecured note. This entity is highly leveraged with significant indebtedness to others. If SAC Holding is unable to meet its obligations to its senior lenders, it could trigger a default of its obligation to us. In such an event of default, we could suffer a loss to the extent the value of the underlying collateral of SAC Holding is inadequate to repay its senior lenders and our junior unsecured note. We cannot assure you that SAC Holding will not default on its loans to their senior lenders or that the value of its assets upon liquidation would be sufficient to repay us in full.\nOur quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with our industry.\nOur business is seasonal and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Historically, revenues have been stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in moving activity during the spring and summer months. The fourth fiscal quarter is generally weakest, due to a greater potential for adverse weather conditions and other factors that are not necessarily seasonal. As a result, our operating results for any given quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.\nOur operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations.\nCompliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common law principles, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remediation plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary. See Note 18, Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal program since 1988 for our underground storage tanks. Despite these compliance efforts, we believe that risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nOur truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state, federal and Canadian agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. In addition, the Federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their industries.\nOur operations can be limited by land-use regulations. Zoning choices enacted by individual municipalities across North America may limit our ability to serve certain markets with our products and services.\nOur insurance companies are heavily regulated by state insurance departments and the NAIC. These insurance regulations are primarily in place to protect the interests of our policyholders and not our investors. Changes in these laws and regulations could increase our costs, inhibit new sales, or limit our ability to implement rate increases.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated through third-parties.\nOur business plan relies upon a network of independent dealers strategically placed throughout North America. As of March 31, 2016 we had approximately 19,500 independent equipment rental dealers. In fiscal 2016, approximately 47% of our equipment rental revenues were generated through this network.\nOur inability to maintain this network or its current cost structure could inhibit our ability to adequately serve our customers and may negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe face liability risks associated with the operation of our rental fleet.\nThe business of renting moving and storage equipment to customers exposes us to liability claims including property damage, personal injury and even death. We seek to limit the occurrence of such events through the design of our equipment, communication of its proper use and exhaustive repair and maintenance schedules. Regardless, accidents still occur and we manage the financial risk of these events through third party insurance carriers. While these excess loss insurance policies are available today at reasonable costs, this could change and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and changes in laws or other labor issues could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nThe success of our business is predicated upon our workforce providing excellent customer service. Our ability to attract and retain this employee base may be inhibited due to prevailing wage rates, benefit costs and the adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Should this occur we may be unable to provide service in certain areas or we may experience significantly increased costs of labor that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business.\nOur information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system, payment processing and telephone systems. While our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to better serve customers, it exposes us to various risks including natural and man-made disasters and cyber-attacks. We have put into place extensive security protocols, backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate these risks. However, disruptions or\nbreaches, detected or undetected by us, for any period of time in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, inflict reputational damage and result in litigation with third parties.\nA.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.\nIn May 2015, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford and Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (\u201cCFLIC\u201d) to A- with a stable outlook and affirmed the financial strength rating for North American Insurance Company (\u201cNAI\u201d) of B++ with a stable outlook. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford\u2019s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford\u2019s ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur losses due to our reinsurers\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future.\nWe use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances; primarily at Repwest and for Moving and Storage. These agreements do not release us from our primary obligations and therefore we remain ultimately responsible for these potential costs. We cannot provide assurance that these reinsurers or counterparties will fulfill their obligations. Their inability or unwillingness to make payments to us under the terms of the contracts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2015, Repwest reported $1.7 million of reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances and $107.3 million of reserves and liabilities ceded to reinsurers. Of this, Repwest\u2019s largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $60.5 million.", "PERMNO": 81073, "SIC": 7510, "TIC": "UHAL"}
