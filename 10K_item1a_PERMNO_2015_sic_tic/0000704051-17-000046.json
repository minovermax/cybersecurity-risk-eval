RISK FACTORS.\nOur business, and the asset management industry in general, is subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that could negatively affect our business or results of operations. These risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the ones discussed below and those discussed elsewhere herein and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we or any of our employees may make.\nRisks Related to our Asset Management Business\nPoor Investment Performance Could Lead to a Loss of Assets Under Management and a Decline in Revenues\nWe believe that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the maintenance and growth of our AUM. Poor investment performance, either on an absolute or relative basis, could impair our revenues and growth because:\n\u2022\nexisting clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products, which would result in lower investment advisory and other fees;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish; and\n\u2022\nnegative absolute investment performance will directly reduce our managed assets.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of our business we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. If our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income will be reduced. From time to time, several of our key alternatives, equity and fixed income asset managers generated poor investment performance, on a relative basis or an absolute basis, in certain products or accounts that they managed, which contributed to a significant reduction in their AUM and revenues and a reduction in performance fees, and several of our asset managers currently face these issues. We face periodic performance issues with certain of our products, and there is typically a lag before improvements in investment performance produce a positive effect on asset flows. In addition, recently the asset management industry has experienced a weakening in the correlation between strong investment performance and increased asset flows. There can be no assurances as to when, or if, investment performance issues will cease to negatively influence our AUM and revenues.\nAssets Under Management May Be Withdrawn, Which May Reduce our Revenues and Net Income\nOur investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of AUM, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in investment preferences of clients, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third-party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management or other personnel and financial market performance. In addition, there has been a trend of investors shifting to alternative, passive, and smart beta strategies. As a result, core equities and fixed income portfolios are declining as a share of global AUM. This risk is underscored by the fact that we have one international client that represents approximately 5 % (primarily liquidity assets) of our total AUM that generates approximately 2.0% of our operating revenues. In addition, in a declining securities market, the pace of mutual fund redemptions and withdrawal of assets from other accounts could accelerate. Poor investment performance generally or relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased purchases of fund shares, increased redemptions of fund shares, and the loss of institutional or individual accounts.\nWe have experienced net outflows of equity AUM for the last 12 fiscal years due in part to investment performance issues. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we had $28.9 billion and $26.1 billion of net client outflows, respectively. Fiscal year 2017 outflows included $27.3 billion, $7.2 billion, and $5.2 billion of liquidity, alternative, and equity net client outflows, respectively, offset in part by $10.8 billion of fixed income net client inflows. Fiscal year 2016 outflows included $14.9 billion, $9.7 billion, and $1.9 billion of liquidity, equity, and alternative net client outflows, respectively, offset in part by $0.4 billion of fixed income net client inflows.\nIf we Are Unable to Maintain our Fee Levels or If our Asset Mix Changes, our Revenues and Margins Could Be Reduced\nOur profit margins and net income are dependent in significant part on our ability to maintain current fee levels for the products and services that our asset managers offer. There has been a trend toward lower fees in many segments of the asset management industry and there is fee pressure in many portions of the active equity and fixed income industry, driven in part by inflows into low-fee passive asset management products. No assurances can be given that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure. Competition could lead to our asset managers reducing the fees that they charge their clients for products and services. See \u201cCompetition in the Asset Management Industry Could Reduce our Revenues and Net Income.\u201d In addition, our asset managers may be required to reduce their fee levels, or restructure the fees they charge, because of, among other things, regulatory initiatives or proceedings that are either industry-wide or specifically targeted, or court decisions. A reduction in the fees that our asset managers charge for their products and services will reduce our revenues and could reduce our net income. These factors also could inhibit our ability to increase fees for certain products.\nOur AUM can generate very different revenues per dollar of managed assets based on factors such as the type of asset managed (alternative assets and equity assets generally produce greater revenues than fixed income assets), the type of client (institutional clients generally pay lower fees than other clients), the type of asset management product or service provided and the fee schedule of the asset manager providing the service. A shift in the mix of our AUM from higher revenue-generating assets to lower revenue-generating assets may result in a decrease in our revenues even if our aggregate level of AUM remains unchanged or increases. A decrease in our revenues, without a commensurate reduction in expenses, will reduce our net income. Although we experienced a shift in the mix of our AUM during fiscal year 2017, during which our equity and alternative AUM increased to $179.8 billion (25% of our total AUM) and $67.9 billion (9% of our total AUM), respectively, on March 31, 2017 from $162.3 billion (24% of our total AUM) and $22.7 billion (3% of our total AUM), respectively, on March 31, 2016, there can be no assurance that this shift will continue. In addition, although average AUM operating revenue yields, excluding performance fees, increased to 38.6 basis points in fiscal year 2017 from 38.2 basis points in fiscal year 2016, because long-term AUM comprised a higher percentage of total average AUM for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, there can be no assurance that the shift to a more favorable asset and product mix will continue in future fiscal years.\nOur Mutual Fund Management Contracts May Not Be Renewed, Which May Reduce our Revenues and Net Income\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from managing U.S. mutual funds. We generally manage these funds pursuant to management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds' boards of directors annually. A majority of the directors of each mutual fund are independent from us. Although the funds' boards of directors have historically approved each of our management contracts, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund that we manage will continue to approve the funds\u2019 management contracts each year, or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to us. If a mutual fund management contract is not renewed, or is revised in a way that is adverse to us, it could result in a reduction in our revenues and, if our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income will be reduced.\nUnavailability of Appropriate Investment Opportunities Could Hamper our Investment Performance or Growth\nAn important component of investment performance is the availability of appropriate investment opportunities for new client funds. If any of our asset managers are not able to find sufficient investments for new client assets in a timely manner, the asset manager's investment performance could be adversely affected. Alternatively, if one of our asset managers does not have sufficient investment opportunities for new funds, it may elect to limit its growth by reducing the rate at which it receives new funds. Depending on, among other factors, prevailing market conditions, the asset manager's investment style, regulatory and other limits and the market sectors and types of opportunities in which the asset manager typically invests (such as less capitalized companies and other more thinly traded securities in which relatively smaller investments are typically made), the risks of not having sufficient investment opportunities may increase when an asset manager increases its AUM, particularly when the increase occurs very quickly. If our asset managers are not able to identify sufficient investment opportunities for new client funds, their investment performance or ability to grow may be reduced.\nChanges in Securities Markets and Prices May Affect our Revenues and Net Income\nA large portion of our revenue is derived from investment advisory contracts with clients. Under these contracts, the investment advisory fees we receive are typically based on the market value of AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our revenues and income to decline by:\n\u2022\ncausing the value of our AUM to decrease, which would result in lower investment advisory and other fees;\n\u2022\ncausing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments they perceive offer greater opportunity or lower risk, which would also result in lower investment advisory and other fees; or\n\u2022\ndecreasing the performance fees earned by our asset managers.\nThere are often substantial fluctuations in price levels in the securities markets. These fluctuations can occur on a daily basis and over longer periods as a result of a variety of factors, including national and international economic and political events, broad trends in business and finance, and interest rate movements. Reduced securities market prices generally may result in reduced revenues from lower levels of AUM and loss or reduction in advisory, incentive and performance fees. Periods of reduced market prices may adversely affect our profitability because fixed costs remain relatively unchanged. Because we operate in one industry, the business cycles of our asset managers may occur contemporaneously. Consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business.\nIn addition, as of March 31, 2017, a substantial portion of our invested assets consisted of securities and other seed capital investments. A decline in the value of alternatives, equity or fixed income securities could lower the value of these investments and result in declines in our non-operating income and net income. Increases or decreases in the value of these investments could increase the volatility of our earnings.\nChanges in Interest Rates Could Have Adverse Effects on our Assets Under Management\nIncreases in interest rates may adversely affect the net asset values of our AUM. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, institutional investors may shift liquidity assets that we manage in pooled investment vehicles to direct investments in the types of assets in which the pooled vehicles invest in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other products or strategies holding lower-yielding instruments. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may result in reduced prices in equity markets. Conversely, decreases in interest rates could lead to outflows in fixed income or liquidity assets that we manage as investors seek higher yields. Any of these effects could lower our AUM and revenues and, if our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income will be reduced.\nThe low interest rate environment experienced in recent years adversely affected the yields of money market funds, which are based on the income from the underlying securities less the operating costs of the funds. When short-term interest rates are at or near zero, the operating expenses of money market funds may become greater than the income from the underlying securities, which reduces the yield of the money market funds to very low levels. In addition, bank deposits may become more attractive to investors and money market funds could experience redemptions, which could decrease our revenues and net income. While interest rates in the U.S. have increased recently, we continue to monitor the industry wide low yields of money market funds, which may result in negative yields, particularly in Europe, which could have a significant adverse effect on the industry in general and our liquidity business in particular. During the past four fiscal years, we voluntarily waived certain fees or assumed expenses of money market funds for competitive reasons, such as to maintain competitive yields, which reduced our advisory fee income and net income. The actual amount of fees waived was dependent on a number of variables including, among others, changes in the net assets held by our money market funds, changes in market yields, changes in the expense levels of the funds, and our willingness to voluntarily continue such fee waivers. These fee waivers for competitive reasons resulted in approximately $22 million in reduced investment advisory revenues in fiscal year 2017. Given the current higher interest rate environment, fee waivers for competitive reasons have not continued into fiscal year 2018.\nCompetition in the Asset Management Industry Could Reduce our Revenues and Net Income\nThe asset management industry in which we are engaged is extremely competitive and we face substantial competition in all aspects of our business. We compete with numerous international and domestic asset management firms and broker-dealers, mutual fund complexes, hedge funds, commercial banks, insurance companies, other investment companies and other financial institutions. Many of these organizations offer products and services that are similar to, or\ncompete with, those offered by our asset managers and have substantially more personnel and greater financial resources than we do. Some of these competitors have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them. In addition, many of our competitors have long-standing and established relationships with distributors and clients. From time to time, our asset managers also compete with each other for clients and assets under management. Our competitors seek to expand market share in many of the products and services we offer. If our competitors successfully expand their market share to the detriment of our market share, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. Our ability to compete may be adversely affected if, among other things, our asset managers lose key employees or, as has been the case for certain of the products managed by our asset managers, under-perform in comparison to relevant performance benchmarks or peer groups.\nThe asset management industry has experienced from time to time the entry of many new firms, as well as significant consolidation as numerous asset management firms have either been acquired by other financial services firms or ceased operations. In many cases, this has resulted in firms with greater financial resources than we have. In addition, a number of heavily capitalized companies, including commercial banks and foreign entities have made investments in and acquired asset management firms. Access to mutual fund distribution channels has also become increasingly competitive. All of these factors could make it more difficult for us to compete, and no assurance can be given that we will be successful in competing and growing our AUM and business. If clients and potential clients decide to use the services of competitors, it could reduce our revenues and growth rate, and if our revenues decrease without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income will be reduced. In this regard, there are a number of asset classes and product types that are not well covered by our current products and services. When these asset classes or products are in favor with investors, we will miss the opportunity to gain the assets under management that are being invested in these assets and face the risk of our managed assets being withdrawn in favor of competitors who provide services covering these classes or products. For example, there is a trend in the asset management business in favor of passive products such as index and certain types of ETFs, which favors our competitors who provide those products over active managers like our asset managers. Investors are increasingly attracted to lower fee passive products, which have gained and may continue to gain share at the expense of active products like the ones managed by our affiliates, and we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products. In addition, our asset managers are not typically the lowest cost provider of asset management services. To the extent that we compete on the basis of price in any of our businesses, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure in that business, which could adversely affect our revenues and net income. In the retail separately managed account program business, there has been a trend toward more open programs that involve more asset managers who provide only investment models which the financial institution sponsor's employees use to allocate assets. A number of the programs for which we provide services have followed this trend, and additional programs could do so in the future. This trend could result in AUM retention issues due to additional competition within the programs, particularly for products with performance issues, and reduced management fees, which are typical results of providing investment models rather than advisory services.\nOur business is asset management. As a result, we may be more affected by trends and issues affecting the asset management industry, such as industry-wide regulatory issues and inquiries, publicity about, and public perceptions of the industry and asset management industry market cycles, than other financial services companies that have more diversified businesses.\nFailure to Properly Address the Increased Transformative Pressures Affecting the Asset Management Industry Could Negatively Impact our Business\nThe asset management industry is facing transformative pressures and trends from a variety of different sources including:\n\u2022\nIncreased fee pressure;\n\u2022\nIncreased demand from clients and distributors for client engagement and value-added services;\n\u2022\nDivergent central bank monetary policies between the U.S Federal Reserve and the central banks of other developed economies;\n\u2022\nA continued shift away from core equities and fixed income strategies and towards alternative, passive, and smart beta strategies;\n\u2022\nA trend towards institutions developing fewer relationships and partners and reducing the number of investment managers they work with;\n\u2022\nIncreased regulatory activity and scrutiny of many aspects of the asset management industry, including transparency/unbundling of fees, inducements, conflicts of interest, capital, liquidity, solvency, leverage, operational risk management, controls and compensation;\n\u2022\nAddressing the key emerging markets in the world, such as China and India, which often have populations with different needs, preferences and horizons than the more developed U.S. and European markets; and\n\u2022\nAdvances in technology and increasing client interest in interacting digitally with their investment portfolios.\nAs a result of the trends and pressures discussed above, the asset management industry is facing an increased level of disruption. If we are unable to adapt our strategy and business to adequately address these trends and pressures listed above, we may be unable to satisfactorily meet client needs, our competitive position may weaken and our business results and operations may be adversely affected.\nWe May Support Government and Retail Money Market Funds to Maintain Their Stable Net Asset Values, or Other Products we Manage, Which Could Affect our Revenues or Operating Results\nApproximately 7% of our AUM as of March 31, 2017, consisted of assets in government or retail money market funds. Money market funds seek to preserve a stable net asset value. While the SEC has implemented rules requiring any institutional prime money market fund and any institutional municipal (or tax-exempt) money market fund that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 to utilize market-based valuations to calculate a floating NAV, government and retail money market funds can continue using current pricing and accounting methods to seek to maintain a stable NAV. Market conditions could lead to severe liquidity or security pricing issues, which could impact the NAV of money market funds. If the NAV of a money market fund managed by our asset managers were to fall below its stable net asset value, we would likely experience significant redemptions in AUM and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues or net income.\nIf a government or retail money market fund's stable NAV comes under pressure, we may elect, as we have done in the past, to provide credit, liquidity, or other support to the fund. We may also elect to provide similar or other support, including by providing liquidity to a fund, to other products we manage for any number of reasons. We are not legally required to support any product and there can be no assurance that any support would be sufficient to avoid an adverse impact on any product or investors in any product. A decision to provide support may arise from factors specific to our products or from industry-wide factors. If we elect to provide support, we could incur losses from the support we provide and incur additional costs, including financing costs, in connection with the support. These losses and additional costs could be material, and could adversely affect our earnings. If we were to take such actions we may also restrict our corporate assets, limiting our flexibility to use these assets for other purposes, and may be required to raise additional capital. In addition, certain proposed regulatory reforms could adversely impact the operating results of our money market funds. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation - Existing U.S. Regulation.\u201d\nFailure to Comply With Contractual Requirements or Guidelines Could Result in Liability and Loss of Assets Under Management, Both of Which Could Cause our Net Income to Decline\nThe asset management contracts under which we manage client assets, including contracts with investment funds, often specify guidelines or contractual requirements that we are obligated to observe in providing asset management services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation, liability to the client or\nthe client reducing its assets under our management, any of which could cause our revenues and net income to decline. This risk is increased by the trend toward customized, specialized mandates seen by many of our asset managers, which tends to result in more complex mandates that are more difficult to administer.\nThe Soundness of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect our Business\nVolatility in the markets has highlighted the interconnection of the global markets and demonstrated how the deteriorating financial condition of one institution may materially and adversely impact the performance of other institutions. Legg Mason, and the funds and accounts that we manage, have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. We, and the funds and accounts we manage, may be exposed to credit, operational or other risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client, or in the event of other unrelated systemic failures in the markets.\nPerformance-Based Fee Arrangements May Increase the Volatility of our Revenues\nA portion of our total revenues is derived from performance fees. Our asset managers earn performance fees under certain client agreements if the investment performance in the portfolio meets or exceeds a specified benchmark. If the investment performance does not meet or exceed the investment return benchmark for a particular period, the asset manager will not generate a performance fee for that period and, if the benchmark is based on cumulative returns, the asset manager's ability to earn performance fees in future periods may be impaired. As of March 31, 2017, approximately 11% of our AUM was in accounts or products that are eligible to earn performance fees. Performance fees earned on pre-close AUM at Clarion Partners (which accounts for approximately 35% of our performance fee eligible AUM as of March 31, 2017) are fully passed through to the Clarion Partners management team, per the terms of the acquisition agreement. The full pass through of Clarion Partners performance fees only applies to historic AUM in place as of the closing of the acquisition on April 13, 2016. We expect the pass through to phase out approximately five years post-closing. We earned $108.3 million, $42.0 million and $83.5 million in performance fees during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of the $108.3 million in performance fees earned during fiscal year 2017, $60.8 million was passed through to the Clarion Partners management team. An increase or decrease in performance fees, or in performance-based fee arrangements with our clients, could create greater fluctuations in our revenues.\nWe Rely Significantly on Third Parties to Distribute Mutual Funds and Certain Other Products\nOur ability to market and distribute mutual funds and certain other investment products that we manage is significantly dependent on access to third-party financial intermediaries that distribute these products. These distributors are generally not contractually required to distribute our products, and typically offer their clients various investment products and services, including proprietary products and services, in addition to and in competition with our products and services. Relying on third-party distributors also exposes us to the risk of increasing costs of distribution, as we compensate them for selling our products and services in amounts that are agreed between them and us but which, in many cases, are largely determined by the distributor. There has been a recent trend of increasing fees paid to certain distributors in the asset management business, and our distribution costs have increased as a result. While the third-party distributors are compensated for distributing our products and services, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in distributing our products and services through them. In addition, mergers and other corporate transactions among distributors may affect our distribution relationships. For example, we are not able to predict the long-term effect of the Morgan Stanley Wealth Management business on our ability to continue to successfully distribute our funds and other products through it, or the costs of doing so. If we are unable to distribute our products and services successfully, it will adversely affect our revenues and net income, and any increase in distribution-related expenses could adversely affect our net income.\nOur Funds-of-Hedge Funds Business Entails a Number of Additional Risks\nEnTrustPermal operates a portion of its business in the international funds-of-hedge funds business. The funds-of-hedge funds business typically involves clients being charged fees on two levels - at the funds-of-funds level and at the underlying funds level. These fees may include management fees and performance fees. There can be no assurance that EnTrustPermal will not be forced to change its fee structures by competitive or other pressures or that EnTrustPermal's fee structures will not hamper its growth. The funds-of-hedge funds industry has been under significant pressure in recent years and has seen significant outflows. There can be no assurance that this pressure will not continue. In addition, EnTrustPermal may generate significant performance fees from time to time, which could increase the volatility of our revenues. See\n\u201cPerformance-Based Fee Arrangements May Increase the Volatility of our Revenues.\u201d Because EnTrustPermal operates in the funds-of-hedge funds business globally, it is exposed to a number of regulatory authorities and requirements in different jurisdictions.\nRisks Related to our Company\nOur Leverage May Affect our Business and May Restrict our Operating Results\nAt March 31, 2017, on a consolidated basis, we had approximately $2.3 billion in total indebtedness, and total stockholders' equity of $4.0 billion, and our goodwill and other intangible assets were $1.9 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. We also have an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. As a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are currently required to use a portion of our cash flow to service interest on our debt, which will limit the cash flow available for other business opportunities. In addition, these servicing obligations will increase in the future as the principal payments on this debt become due or if we incur additional indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal, to pay interest, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control and by a variety of factors specific to our business.\nThe level of our indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future or to borrow under our existing credit facilities (our principal bank debt facility requires that (i) our ratio of net debt (total debt less unrestricted cash in excess of working capital) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined therein) not exceed (a) 3.5 to 1 at any time during the period from January 1, 2017, through and including March 31, 2018, and (b) 3 to 1 at any other time., and (ii) our ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to total cash interest payments on certain Indebtedness (as defined therein) exceeds 4.0 to 1);\n\u2022\nlimit cash flow available for general corporate purposes due to the ongoing cash flow requirements for debt service;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility, including our ability to react to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nAs of March 31, 2017, under the terms of our bank credit agreement our ratio of net debt to Consolidated EBITDA was 2.6 to 1 and our ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense was 5.7 to 1, and, therefore, Legg Mason was in compliance with its bank financial covenants. If our net income significantly declines for any reason, it may be difficult to remain in compliance with these covenants. Similarly, to the extent that we spend our available cash for purposes other than repaying debt or acquiring businesses that increase our EBITDA, we will increase our net debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio. Although there are actions that we may take if our financial covenant compliance becomes an issue, there can be no assurance that Legg Mason will remain in compliance with its bank debt covenants.\nOur access to credit on reasonable terms is also partially dependent on our credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, it will likely become more difficult and costly for us to access the credit markets or otherwise incur new debt.\nUpon the occurrence of various events, such as a change of control, some or all of our outstanding debt obligations may come due prior to their maturity dates and may require payments in excess of their outstanding amounts, which in certain circumstances may be significant.\nWe May Engage in Strategic Transactions That Could Create Risks\nAs part of our business strategy, we regularly review, are currently reviewing, and from time to time have discussions with respect to potential strategic transactions, including potential acquisitions, dispositions, consolidations, joint ventures or similar transactions and \u201clift-outs\u201d of portfolio management teams, some of which may be material. There can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices, have sufficient capital resources\nto accomplish our strategy, or be successful in entering into agreements for desired transactions. In addition, these transactions typically involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:\n\u2022\nadverse effects on our reported earnings per share in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired;\n\u2022\nexistence of unknown liabilities or contingencies that arise after closing; and\n\u2022\npotential disputes with counterparties.\nAcquisitions, related transactions and completed acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Clarion Partners and EnTrust and the combination of EnTrust with Permal to form EnTrustPermal, pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations. We could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems, including problems related to execution or integration. Following the completion of an acquisition, we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support, including financial reporting and internal controls, to the acquired business for a period of time. There can be no assurance that the seller will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us.\nStrategic transactions typically are announced publicly even though they may remain subject to numerous closing conditions, contingencies and approvals and there is no assurance that any announced transaction will actually be consummated. The failure to consummate an announced transaction could have an adverse effect on us. Future transactions may also further increase our leverage or, if we issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions, dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders.\nIf our Reputation is Harmed, we Could Suffer Losses in our Business, Revenues and Net Income\nOur business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients and other market participants, and the resulting good reputation is critical to our business. Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries, employee misconduct and rumors, among other things, can substantially damage our reputation, even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed. Regulatory sanctions or adverse litigation results can also cause substantial damage to our reputation. Any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel, and lead to a reduction in the amount of our AUM, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.\nFailure to Properly Address Conflicts of Interest Could Harm our Reputation, Business and Results of Operations\nAs we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client base, we must continue to address conflicts between our interests and those of our clients. In addition, the SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. We have procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to address these issues. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest, we could face reputational damage, litigation or regulatory proceedings or penalties, any of which may adversely affect our revenues or net income.\nLoss of Key Personnel Could Harm our Business\nWe are dependent on the continued services of a number of our key asset management personnel and our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of any of such personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, since certain of our asset managers operate with lean management teams and contribute significantly to our revenues and net income, the loss of even a small number of key personnel at these businesses could have a disproportionate impact on our overall business. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with asset management experience in order to operate our business successfully. The market for experienced asset management professionals is extremely competitive and is increasingly characterized by the movement of employees among different firms. Due to the competitive market for asset management professionals and the success of some of our employees, our costs to attract and retain key employees are significant and will likely increase over time. From time to time, we may work with key employees to revise revenue sharing arrangements and other employment-related terms to reflect current circumstances, including in situations where a revenue sharing arrangement may result in insufficient revenues being retained by the subsidiary. In addition, since the investment track record of many of our products and services is often attributed to a small number of individual employees, and sometimes one person, the departure of one or more of these employees could\ncause the business to lose client accounts or managed assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our operations and financial results would be materially adversely affected.\nOur Business is Subject to Numerous Operational Risks\nWe face numerous operational risks related to our business on a day-to-day basis. Among other things, we must be able to consistently and reliably obtain securities pricing information, process trading activity, process client and investor transactions and provide reports and other customer service to our clients, investors and distributors. Failure to keep current and accurate books and records can render us subject to disciplinary action by governmental and self-regulatory authorities, as well as to claims by our clients. A portion of our software is licensed from and supported by outside vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating system failure. A suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support, upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption. If any of our financial, portfolio accounting or other data processing systems, or the systems of third parties on whom we rely, do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, or those of third parties on whom we rely, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, a financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory problems or damage to our reputation. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more offices. In addition, our operations are dependent upon information from, and communications with, third parties, and operational problems at third parties may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business.\nWe depend on our headquarters, the offices of our subsidiaries, our operations centers and third-party providers for the continued operation of our business. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of our business, a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our asset managers, or an event disrupting the ability of our employees to perform their job functions, including terrorist attacks or a disruption involving electrical communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, directly affecting our headquarters, the offices of our subsidiaries, our operations centers or the travel of our sales, client service and other personnel, may have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption or impede the growth of our business. Although we have disaster recovery and business continuity programs in place, there can be no assurance that these will be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. If we fail to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, our ability to operate could be adversely impacted or our ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and sanctions. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses.\nFailure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses\nOur operations rely on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities to provide secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems, networks and mobile devices and on the computer systems, networks and mobile devices of third parties on which we rely. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software, networks and mobile devices, and those of third parties on whom we rely, may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, sabotage, unauthorized access, computer viruses, worms or other malicious code, and other events that have a security impact. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information and could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability. If one or more of such events occur, it potentially could jeopardize our or our clients', employees' or counterparties' confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our or third party computer systems, networks and mobile devices, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients', our counterparties' or third parties' operations. As a result, we could experience material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause a decline in our earnings. We may be required to spend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against fully or not fully covered through any insurance that we maintain.\nWe May Incur Charges Related to Leased Facilities\nWe continue to be exposed to the risk of incurring charges related to subleases or vacant space for several of our leased offices. As of March 31, 2017, our future commitments from third parties under non-cancellable subleases were approximately $126 million, which in total, net of reserves, effectively offsets obligations under our leases for the properties. As of March 31, 2017, our total future lease commitments for office space that we vacated and are seeking to sublease were approximately $20 million, of which we reserved approximately $9 million through lease charges to our earnings during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Under generally accepted accounting principles, at the time a sublease is entered into or space is deemed permanently abandoned, we must incur a charge equal to the present value of the amount by which the commitments under the lease exceeds the amount due, or amount expected to be received, under a sublease. As a result, in a period of declining commercial lease markets, we are exposed to the risk of incurring charges relating to any premises we are seeking to sublease resulting from longer periods to identify sub-tenants and reduced market rent rates leading to new sub-tenants paying less in rent than we are paying under our lease. Also, if a sub-tenant defaults on its sublease, we would likely incur a charge for the rent that we will incur during the period that we expect would be required to sublease the premises and any reduction in rent that current market rent rates lead us to expect a new sub-tenant will pay. There can be no assurance that we will not recognize additional lease-related charges, which may be material to our results of operations.\nPotential Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets Could Increase our Expenses and Reduce our Assets\nDetermining goodwill and intangible assets, and evaluating them for impairment, requires significant management estimates and judgment, including estimating value and assessing life in connection with the allocation of purchase price in the acquisition creating them. Our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired as a result of any number of factors, including losses of investment management contracts or declines in the value of managed assets. Any impairment of goodwill or intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we incurred impairment charges associated with our RARE Infrastructure amortizable management contracts asset and Permal trade name asset of $18 million and $17 million, respectively. Also, during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we incurred aggregate impairment charges of $371 million ($297 million, net of taxes) relating to the Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts and Permal trade name assets. Changes in the assumptions underlying projected cash flows from the assets or reporting unit, resulting from market conditions, reduced AUM or other factors, could result in an impairment of any of these assets.\nThe domestic mutual fund contracts asset acquired in the 2005 acquisition of the Citigroup Asset Management business of $2.1 billion and the EnTrustPermal funds contracts asset of $596 million account for approximately 55% and 15%, respectively, of our indefinite-life intangible assets, while the goodwill in our reporting unit aggregates $1.9 billion. As of March 31, 2017, we also had $1.0 billion of other indefinite-life intangible assets, which includes indefinite-life mutual funds contract assets of $505 million and $130 million, recorded at fair value in connection with the acquisitions of Clarion Partners in April 2016 and RARE Infrastructure in October 2015, respectively.\nIn addition to the previously discussed impairments of the RARE Infrastructure amortizable management contracts asset and the Permal trade name asset, the carrying value of the Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts asset was written down to fair value as a result of the aforementioned impairment during the quarter ended December 31, 2015. As a result of impairing the contract and trade name assets, decreases in our cash flow projections or increases in the discount rates, resulting from actual results, or changes in assumptions due to market conditions, reduced AUM, less favorable operating margins, lower yielding asset mixes, and other factors, may result in further impairment of the related assets. There can be no assurances that continued market uncertainty or asset outflows, or other factors, will not produce additional impairment in some or all of these assets. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding a reduction in the contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure subsequent to March 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the date of our most recent annual testing, the estimated fair value of the Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts asset exceeded the carrying value by approximately $15 million. After completing the annual impairment testing process as of December 31, 2016, the EnTrust funds management contracts asset was combined with the Permal funds-of-hedge funds management contracts asset because the assets are managed and operated collectively. The related carrying values and cash flows of the funds will be aggregated for future impairment testing. The combined asset remains sensitive to changes in the actual results or assumptions noted above, therefore, market decreases, outflows or other\nchanges in the actual results or the assumptions noted above may result in an impairment of the combined EnTrustPermal fund management contracts asset.\nThere can be no assurances that continued market uncertainty or asset outflows, or other factors, will not produce an additional impairment. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Intangible Assets and Goodwill.\u201d\nOur Deferred Tax Assets May Not Be Fully Realizable\nAs of March 31, 2017, we had approximately $732 million in U.S. federal deferred tax assets, which represent tax benefits that we expect to realize in future periods. Under accounting rules, we are required to recognize a charge to earnings to reduce our deferred tax assets if it is determined that any future tax benefits are not likely to be realized before they expire. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated. Those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. In order to realize these future tax benefits, we estimate that we must generate approximately $3.7 billion in future U.S. earnings, of which $811 million must be foreign sourced earnings, before the benefits expire. There can be no assurances that we will achieve this level of earnings before some portion of these tax benefits expires. In addition, our belief that we will likely be able to realize these future tax benefits is based in part upon our estimates of the timing of other differences in revenue and expense recognition between tax returns and financial statements, certain planning strategies and our understanding of the application of tax regulations and ability to implement certain tax planning strategies, which may be revised to incorporate future changes in tax or accounting regulations. In addition, the value of our deferred tax assets are based on enacted corporate tax rates for future periods. Legislative changes related to these rates would require a measurement of our deferred tax assets in the period of enactment. Currently there are proposals to significantly change U.S. federal income tax rules which include proposals to reduce tax rates, limit deductibility of interest expense, and changes to the taxation of non-U.S. earnings. Although details are not yet available, these changes could impact the carrying value of our deferred tax assets. Further, our estimates and assumptions do not contemplate certain possible future changes in the ownership of Legg Mason stock, which, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), could limit our utilization of net operating loss and foreign tax credit benefits. Under the relevant Code provisions, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative net increase in the aggregate ownership of Legg Mason stock by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) of more than 50 percent of the total outstanding shares of Legg Mason stock during a rolling three-year period. An ownership change would prospectively establish an annual limitation on the amount of pre-change net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to reduce our tax liability. The amount of the limitation would generally equal the amount of our market capitalization immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect at that time. Such an ownership change would impact the timing or amount of net operating loss or foreign tax credit benefits we ultimately realize before they expire. If we are required to recognize a charge to earnings to reduce our deferred tax assets, the charge may be material to our earnings or financial condition.\nWe Are Exposed to a Number of Risks Arising From our International Operations\nOur asset managers operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States on behalf of international clients. We have offices in numerous countries and many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the United States. Our international operations require us to comply with the legal requirements of various foreign jurisdictions, expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks, expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences which, among other things, make it more difficult to repatriate to the United States the cash that we generate outside the U.S. At March 31, 2017, our total liquid assets, which include cash, cash equivalents and certain current investment securities, were $999 million. These liquid assets included approximately $336 million of cash and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries, some of which, if repatriated, may be subject to material tax effects.\nIn addition, we are exposed to certain risks related to the different currencies in which we transact and the home jurisdictions of certain securities in which our AUM is invested. Uncertainties regarding developments in those jurisdictions can produce volatility in global financial markets and adversely impact our results of operations. For example, the June 2016 U.K. electorate vote to exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) resulted in market volatility that may continue during the Brexit negotiation process. This may impact the levels and composition of our AUM and also negatively impact investor sentiment, which could result in reduced or negative flows. In addition, because the U.K. Pound Sterling and the Euro are\nthe currency used in certain aspects of our business, any weakening of the U.K. Pound Sterling or Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar could negatively impact our reported financial results.\nDespite controls and other actions reasonably designed to mitigate these risks, our international operations expose us to risks arising from Legg Mason's potential responsibility for actions of third party agents and other representatives of our business operating outside our primary jurisdictions of operation. Our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in managing, operating and marketing our international operations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on AUM and revenues in our U.S. dollar-based financial statements; and\n\u2022\nsignificant adverse changes in foreign political, economic, legal and regulatory environments.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nRegulatory Matters May Negatively Affect our Business and Results of Operations\nOur business is subject to regulation by various regulatory authorities around the world that are charged with protecting the interests of our clients. We could be subject to civil liability, criminal liability, or sanction, including revocation of our subsidiaries' registrations as investment advisers, revocation of the licenses of our employees, censures, fines, or temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, if we violate such laws or regulations. Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and business prospects. In addition, the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years. Our profitability could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce. In particular, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant additional costs as a result of regulatory changes affecting U.S. mutual funds and changes to European mutual fund regulation.\nWe may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. The challenges associated with consistently interpreting regulations issued in multiple countries may add to such risks. The U.S. federal government and governments in non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate have made, and have proposed further, significant changes to the regulatory structure of the financial services industry, and we expect to spend time and resources to comply with these regulatory changes. For a summary of the laws, regulations and regulators to which we are subject, see \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulation.\u201d\nInstances of criminal activity and fraud by participants in the asset management industry, disclosures of trading and other abuses by participants in the financial services industry and significant governmental intervention and investment in the financial markets and financial firms have led the U.S. government and regulators to increase the rules and regulations governing, and oversight of, the U.S. financial system. This activity has resulted in changes to the laws and regulations governing the asset management industry and more aggressive enforcement of the existing laws and regulations. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services regulatory environment and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and many regulatory decisions to be implemented. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have, and other regulatory proposals may, require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business, have or may increase regulatory compliance burdens, and may have unintended adverse consequences on the liquidity or structure of the financial markets. The ongoing revisions to the laws and regulations governing our business, and their counterparts internationally, are an ongoing process. The cumulative effect of these actions may result in increased expenses, or lower management or other fees, and therefore adversely affect the revenues or profitability of our business.\nOur Business Involves Risks of Being Engaged in Litigation, Regulatory Proceedings and Tax Disputes, Which May Result in Liability That Could Increase our Expenses and Reduce our Net Income\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability. In the normal course of business, our asset managers are from time to time named as defendants or co-defendants in lawsuits, or are involved in disputes that involve the threat of lawsuits, seeking substantial damages. We are also involved from time to time in governmental and self-regulatory organization investigations and proceedings, including the regulatory proceedings discussed in Note 8 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we are involved in a tax dispute in Brazil arising from matters relating to the tax deductibility of goodwill amortization with respect to the Brazilian business of our subsidiary, Western Asset Management. The assessments that were subject to the dispute for the years 2007 and 2008 were withdrawn after we received a favorable ruling in administrative court. The assessments for the years 2009 through 2010 were recently upheld by the judgment of the same level administrative court (but by a different panel) that overruled the assessments for the previous period. We are in the process of appealing this result. The net amount of tax, interest and penalty at issue in the years subject to our appeal is over $12 million. Additionally, new assessments were issued for the years 2011 through 2014 and the net amount at issue in those years is over $24 million. It may take another three to five years or longer to achieve final resolution of this matter as it potentially could go through multiple levels of appeal. During that time, the current $36 million amount in dispute could increase to approximately $47 million due to additional interest and penalty accruals and denial of future year deductions. While there can be no assurance of the timing or outcome of this dispute, or that we will receive additional favorable judgments in connection with this matter, we and our local advisors continue to believe that our tax position is correct and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to pay the taxes in question or any related interest and penalties.\nIn addition, the investment funds that our asset managers manage are subject to actual and threatened lawsuits and governmental and self-regulatory organization investigations and proceedings, any of which could harm the investment returns or reputation of the applicable fund or result in our asset managers being liable to the funds for any resulting damages. There has been an increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the asset management industry in recent years, including customer claims as well as class action suits seeking substantial damages. Any litigation can increase our expenses and reduce our net income.\nInsurance May Not Be Available on a Cost Effective Basis to Protect us From Liability\nWe face the inherent risk of liability related to litigation from clients, third-party vendors or others and actions taken by regulatory agencies. To help protect against these potential liabilities, we purchase insurance in amounts, and against risks, that we consider appropriate, where such insurance is available at prices we deem acceptable. There can be no assurance, however, that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or, if covered, will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage, that any insurer will remain solvent and will meet its obligations to provide us with coverage or that insurance coverage will continue to be available with sufficient limits at a reasonable cost. Insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured, and may increase significantly over relatively short periods. In addition, certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs. Renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or co-insurance liability.", "PERMNO": 65330, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "LM"}
