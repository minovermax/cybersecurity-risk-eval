{"cik": "1403475", "company": "Bank of Marin Bancorp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. The material risks and uncertainties that Management believes may affect our business are described below. Before making an investment decision, investors should carefully consider the risks, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The list below is not exhaustive; additional risks and uncertainties that Management is not aware of, or focused on, or currently deems immaterial may also impair business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nEarnings are Significantly Influenced by General Business and Economic Conditions\nWe are subject to changes in general economic conditions that are uncertain and beyond our control. While economic activity has been expanding, the recovery in the labor market is not complete and there is still underutilization of labor resources. Uncertainty in the economies of Europe and emerging markets have the potential to hamper domestic economic performance. The economic environment is impacted by political uncertainty and changes in fiscal and monetary policy, which could adversely affect our business. Economic conditions have led to prolonged low interest rates, particularly medium and longer-term rates, which may have a long-term impact on the composition of our earning assets and our net interest margin. Among other things, a period of prolonged lower rates has caused prepayments to increase as our customers sought to refinance existing loans, which resulted in a decrease in the weighted average yield of our earning assets and variability in our net interest income. Furthermore, financial institutions continue to be affected by a stricter regulatory environment. Unemployment rates in our market areas have continued to improve and are below the California state average rate.1 There can be no assurance that the recent economic improvement is sustainable or that the creditworthiness of our borrowers will not deteriorate.\nWeakness in real estate values and home sale volumes, financial stress on borrowers, including job losses, and customers' inability to pay debt could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the following ways:\n\u2022\nDemand for our products and services may decline\n\u2022\nLow cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease\n\u2022\nCollateral for our loans, especially real estate, may decline in value\n\u2022\nLoan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase\n\u2022\nInvestment securities may become impaired\nInterest Rate Risk is Inherent in Our Business\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors outside our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, can influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but can also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of our securities and loan portfolios. Our portfolio of securities will generally decline in value if market interest rates increase, and increase in value if market interest rates decline. Our mortgage-backed securities are also subject to prepayment risk when interest rates fall, and to borrowers' risk when rates rise.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n1 Based on the latest available labor market information from the California Employment Development Department. December 2014 results show that the unemployment rate in Marin County was the lowest in California at 3.4%. The unemployment rates in San Francisco, Sonoma, Napa and Alameda County are 3.8%, 4.7%, 5.1% and 5.0%, respectively, compared to the state of California at 7.0%.\nPage-12\nIn response to the recessionary state of the national economy, the depressed housing market and the volatility of financial markets in 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee of the FRB (\u201cFOMC\u201d) initiated a series of decreases in the federal funds target rate, bringing the target rate to a historically low range of 0% to 0.25%, where it is maintained currently. The FRB's sizable holdings of longer-term securities have placed and will continue to place downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, and hence our net interest margin. Our net interest income is hampered by a flat or falling rate environment, and the prolonged low level of interest rates has resulted in material net interest margin compression over the last several years. Our 2015 net interest margin may compress due to continued repricing on loans and securities, if the prevailing market interest rates do not increase as the general market expects in the second half of 2015. FOMC Chair Janet Yellen also signaled in her testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on February 24, 2015 that, \"a high degree of monetary policy accommodation remains appropriate to foster further improvement in labor market conditions and to promote a return of inflation toward 2% over the medium term.\"\nSee the sections captioned \u201cNet Interest Income\u201d in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A of this report for further discussion related to management of interest rate risk.\nIf interest rates rise, we anticipate that net interest income will increase. However, it may take several upward market rate movements for certain variable rate loans to move above their floor rates and deposit behavior may deviate from our expectations. Further, a rise in index rates leads to lower debt service coverage of variable rate loans if the borrower's operating cash flow does not also rise. This creates a paradox of an improving economy (leading to higher interest rates) with increased credit risk as short-term rates move up faster than the cash flow or income of the borrowers. Higher interest rates may also depress loan demand, making it more difficult for us to grow loans.\nBanks and Bank Holding Companies are Subject to Extensive Government Regulation and Supervision\nBancorp and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state governmental supervision, regulation and control. Holding company regulations affect the range of activities in which Bancorp is engaged. Banking regulations affect the Bank's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices and dividend policy, and compliance costs among other things. Future legislative changes or interpretations may also alter the structure and competitive relationship among financial institutions. Legislation is regularly introduced in the U.S. Congress and the California Legislature which could impact our operating environment in substantive ways. The nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting us are unpredictable at this time.\nThe historic disruptions in the financial marketplace during the recent recession have prompted the Obama administration to reform financial market regulation. This reform includes additional regulations over consumer financial products, bond rating agencies and the creation of a regime for regulating systemic risk across all types of financial service firms. Further restrictions on financial service companies may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, as well as increase our compliance risk.\nCompliance risk is the current and prospective risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of, or non-conformance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards set forth by regulators. Compliance risk also arises in situations where the laws or rules governing certain bank products or activities of our clients may be ambiguous or untested. This risk exposes Bancorp and the Bank to potential fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk can lead to diminished reputation, reduced franchise value, limited business opportunities, reduced expansion potential and an inability to enforce contracts.\nFor further information on supervision and regulation, see the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1 above.\nPage-13\nAs discussed in Item 1, Section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d above, in 2010, President Obama signed into law a landmark financial reform bill - the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules under the Dodd-Frank Act change banking statutes and the operating environment of Bancorp and the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could continue to increase the cost of doing business, decrease our revenues, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance depending upon whether or how regulations are implemented. In 2013 the federal banking regulators issued a joint final rule that implements Basel III capital standards and establishes minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act, which is discussed under \"Capital Requirements\" on page 9. We may continue to invest significant Management attention and resources to make any necessary changes related to the Dodd-Frank Act and any regulations promulgated thereunder. The ultimate effect that the changes will have on the financial condition or results of operations of Bancorp or the Bank is uncertain at this time.\nThe broader impact of the enacted legislation and related measures undertaken to alleviate the aftermaths of the credit crisis is also unknown. The capital and credit markets experienced volatility and disruption at unprecedented levels in the last credit crisis. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. If similar disruptions and volatility return, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect on our ability to access credit or capital.\nIntense Competition with Other Financial Institutions to Attract and Retain Banking Customers\nWe are facing significant competition for customers from other banks and financial institutions located in the markets we serve. We compete with commercial banks, saving banks, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies and other financial institutions operating within or near our service areas. Some of our non-bank competitors may not be subject to the same extensive regulations as we are, giving them greater flexibility in competing for business. We anticipate intense competition will continue for the coming year due to the consolidation of many financial institutions and more changes in legislature, regulation and technology. National and regional banks much larger than our size have entered into our market through acquisitions and they may be able to benefit from economies of scale through their wider branch networks, more prominent national advertising campaigns, lower cost of borrowing, capital market access and sophisticated technology infrastructures. Further, intense competition for creditworthy borrowers could lead to loan rate concession pressure or impact our ability to generate profitable loans.\nGoing forward, we may see tighter competition in the industry as competitors seek to expand market share in more profitable and less risky customer segments. Further, with the rebound of the equity markets, our deposit customers may perceive alternative investment opportunities as providing superior expected returns. Recent recovery in the real estate market also supports the sale of real estate that collateralizes our loans, leading to payoff activity. Technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments or other deposit accounts such as online virtual banks and non-bank service providers. Efforts and initiatives we may undertake to retain and increase deposits, including deposit pricing, can increase our costs. When our customers move money into higher yielding deposits or alternative investments, we may lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, thus increasing our funding costs through more expensive wholesale borrowings.\nNegative Conditions Affecting Real Estate May Harm Our Business\nConcentration of our lending activities in the California real estate sector could negatively impact our results of operations if adverse changes in our lending area occur or intensify. Although we do not offer traditional first mortgages, nor have sub-prime or Alt-A residential loans or significant amounts of securities backed by such loans in the portfolio, we are not immune to volatility in those markets. Approximately 86% of our loans were secured by real estate at December 31, 2014, of which 63% were secured by commercial real estate and the remaining 23% by residential real estate. Real estate valuations are impacted by demand, and demand is driven by factors such as employment; when unemployment rates rise, demand drops.\nLoans secured by commercial real estate include those secured by office buildings, owner-user office/warehouses, mixed-use residential/commercial properties and retail properties. In general, 2014 office, industrial and retail vacancy rates have fallen in Marin, Sonoma and Napa Counties based on the latest available real estate information from Keegan & Coppin Company, Inc. There can be no assurance that the companies or properties securing our loans will\nPage-14\ngenerate sufficient cash flows to allow borrowers to make full and timely loan payments to us. In the event of default, the collateral value may not cover the outstanding amount due to us, especially during real estate market downturns.\nRising commercial real estate lending concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in the investor commercial real estate market. Institutions that are potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. Institutions that have experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending such as us, have notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate lending, or are approaching or exceed certain supervisory criteria that measure an institution's commercial real estate portfolio against its capital levels, may be subject to such increased regulatory scrutiny. We maintain heightened review and analyses of our concentrations and have regular conversations with regulators to avoid unexpected regulatory risk.\nSevere Weather, Natural Disasters or Other Climate Change Related Matters Could Significantly Impact Our Business\nOur primary market is located in an earthquake-prone zone in northern California, which is also subject to other weather or disasters, such as severe rainstorms, wildfire, drought or flood. These events could interrupt our business operations unexpectedly. Climate-related physical changes and hazards could also pose credit risks for us. For example, our borrowers may have collateral properties located in coastal areas at risk to rise in sea level. The properties pledged as collateral on our loan portfolio could also be damaged by tsunamis, floods, earthquakes or wildfires and thereby the recoverability of loans could be impaired. A number of factors can affect credit losses, including the extent of damage to the collateral, the extent of damage not covered by insurance, the extent to which unemployment and other economic conditions caused by the natural disaster adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, and the cost of collection and foreclosure to us. Lastly, there could be increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in the availability of coverage, due to severe weather-related losses. The ultimate impact on our business of a natural disaster, whether or not caused by climate change, is difficult to predict.\nWe are Subject to Significant Credit Risk and Loan Losses May Exceed Our Allowance for Loan Losses in the Future\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through provisions for loan losses charged to expense, that represents Management's best estimate of probable losses that may be incurred within the existing portfolio of loans (the \"incurred loss model\"). The level of the allowance reflects Management's continuing evaluation of industry concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality and present economic, political and regulatory conditions. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Further, we generally rely on appraisals of the collateral or comparable sales data to determine the level of specific reserve and/or the charge-off amount on certain collateral dependent loans. Inaccurate assumptions in the appraisals or an inappropriate choice of the valuation techniques may lead to an inadequate level of specific reserve or charge-offs.\nChanges in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans and their collateral, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors may require an increase in our allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses or cash flows from acquired loans do not perform as expected, we will need to record additional provision for loan losses.\nIn December 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued a proposed Accounting Standards Update, Financial Instruments: Credit Losses, which establishes a new impairment framework also known as the \"current expected credit loss model.\" In contrast to the incurred loss model currently used by financial entities like Bancorp, the current expected credit loss model requires an allowance be recognized based on the expected credit losses (i.e. all contractual cash flows that the entity does not expect to collect from financial assets or commitments to extend credit). It requires the consideration of more forward-looking information than is permitted under current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition to relevant information about past events and current conditions, such as borrowers\u2019 current creditworthiness, quantitative and qualitative factors specific to borrowers, and the economic environment in which the entity operates, the new model requires consideration of reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected collectability of the financial assets\u2019 remaining contractual cash flows,\nPage-15\nand evaluation of the forecasted direction of the economic cycle, as well as time value of money. This proposed impairment framework is expected to have wide reaching implications to financial institutions. The allowance for loan losses is likely to increase due to a larger volume of financial assets that fall within the scope of the proposed model, resulting in an adverse impact on net income, volatility in earnings and higher capital requirements. The FASB continued to deliberate the proposed update at its September and October 2014 meetings, and the full effect of the implementation of this new model is unknown until the proposed guidance is finalized.\nNon-performing Assets Take Significant Time To Resolve And Adversely Affect Results Of Operations And Financial Condition.\nThe Bank's non-performing assets have historically been maintained at a manageable level. While we have significantly reduced non-performing assets, such assets may adversely affect our net income in various ways in the future. Until economic improvement continues in a sustainable fashion, we might incur losses relating to non-performing assets if their collateral values deteriorate. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans, which adversely affects our income and increases our loan administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related loan to the fair value of the collateral, which may result in a loss. While we have managed our problem assets through workouts, restructurings and other proactive credit management, decreases in the value of the assets, underlying collateral, or borrowers' performance or financial conditions, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of non-performing assets requires significant commitments of time from Management, which can detract from other responsibilities. There can be no assurance that we will not experience further increases in non-performing assets in the future.\nSecurities May Lose Value due to Credit Quality of the Issuers\nWe hold securities issued and/or guaranteed by Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFNMA\u201d) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFHLMC\u201d). Since 2008, both FNMA and FHLMC have been under a U.S. Government conservatorship which purchases mortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d) issued by them. As a result, the MBS issued by FNMA and FHLMC have experienced an increase in fair value and our MBS portfolio has benefited from this government support. However, recent introduction of housing and finance reform legislation, which plans to wind down FNMA and FHLMC and incrementally shrink the government's housing-finance footprint, led to uncertainty as to the termination of conservatorship of FNMA and FHLMC.\nThe fair value of our securities issued or guaranteed by these entities may decline when the U.S. Government starts selling FNMA and FHLMC MBS, when the government support is phased-out or completely withdrawn, or if either FNMA or FHLMC comes under further financial stress or suffers creditworthiness deterioration.\nWe also invest in obligations of state and political subdivisions, some of which may not have fully recovered from past years' of loss of property tax from falling home values and declines in sales tax revenues. While we generally seek to minimize our exposure by diversifying the geographic location of our portfolio and investing in investment grade securities, there is no guarantee that the issuers will remain financially sound or continue their payments on these debentures.\nUnexpected Early Termination of Interest Rate Swap Agreements May Impact Earnings\nWe have entered into interest-rate swap agreements, primarily as an asset/liability risk management strategy, in order to mitigate the changes in the fair value of specified long-term fixed-rate loans and firm commitments to enter into long-term fixed-rate loans caused by changes in interest rates. These hedges allow us to offer long-term, fixed-rate loans to customers without assuming the interest rate risk of a long-term asset by swapping our fixed-rate interest stream for a floating-rate interest stream. In the event of default by the borrowers on our hedged loans, we may have to terminate these designated interest-rate swap agreements early, resulting in severe prepayment penalties charged by our counterparties. On the other hand, when these interest-rate swap agreements are in an asset position, we are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties, who may default on the interest-rate swap agreements, leaving us vulnerable to interest rate movements.\nPage-16\nGrowth May Produce Unfavorable Outcomes\nWe seek to expand our franchise safely and consistently. A successful growth strategy requires us to manage multiple aspects of the business simultaneously, such as following adequate loan underwriting standards, balancing loan and deposit growth without increasing interest rate risk or compressing our net interest margin, maintaining sufficient capital, and recruiting, training and retaining qualified professionals.\nOur growth strategy also includes merger and acquisition possibilities that either enhance our market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. We may be exposed to difficulties in combining the operations of acquired institutions into our own operations, which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from our acquisition activities. Our earnings, financial condition and prospects after a merger will depend in part on our ability to integrate the operations and management of the acquired institution while continuing to implement other aspects of our business plan. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired institution and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully. Among the issues that we could face are:\n\u2022\nunexpected problems with operations, personnel, technology or credit;\n\u2022\nloss of customers and employees of the acquiree;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in working with the acquiree's employees and customers;\n\u2022\nthe assimilation of the acquiree's operations, culture and personnel;\n\u2022\ninstituting and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022\nlitigation risk not discovered during the due diligence period.\nUndiscovered factors as a result of an acquisition could bring liabilities against us, our management and the management of the institutions we acquire. These factors could contribute to our not achieving the expected benefits from our acquisitions within desired time frames, if at all. Further, although we generally anticipate cost savings from acquisitions, we may not be able to fully realize those savings. Any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings.\nWe May Not Be Able To Attract and Retain Key Employees\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged by us can be intense, especially in light of the recent improvement in the job market, and we may not be able to hire skilled people or retain them. We do not have non-compete agreements with any of our senior officers. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of the skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nAccounting Estimates and Risk Management Processes Rely On Analytical and Forecasting Models\nThe processes we use to estimate probable loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models we use for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models we use for determining our probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPage-17\nThe Value Of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets May Decline In The Future\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had goodwill totaling $6.4 million and a core deposit intangible asset totaling $3.7 million from the NorCal acquisition. A significant decline in expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock could necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe May Take Filing Positions or Follow Tax Strategies That May Be Subject to Challenge\nWe provide for current and deferred taxes in our consolidated financial statements based on our results of operations, business activities and business combinations, legal structure and federal and state legislation and regulations. We may take filing positions or follow tax strategies that are subject to interpretation of tax statutes. Our net income may be reduced if a federal, state or local authority were to assess charges for taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements. Taxing authorities could change applicable tax laws, challenge filing positions or assess new taxes and interest charges. If taxing authorities take any of these actions, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely and significantly affected.\nFinancial Institutions Rely on Technology and Continually Encounter Technological Change\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology will enable efficiency and meet customers' changing needs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Failure to keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the long-term success of our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nCyber Security is a Growing Risk for Financial Institutions\nOur business requires the secure handling of sensitive client information. We also rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Cyber incidents include intentional attacks and unintentional events that may present unauthorized access to digital systems that disrupt operations, corrupt data, release sensitive information or cause denial-of-service on our websites. We store, process and transmit account information in connection with lending and deposit relationships, including funds transfer and online banking. A breach of cyber-security systems of the Bank, our vendors or customers, or widely publicized breaches of other financial institutions could significantly harm our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and financial liability. While we have systems and procedures designed to prevent security breaches, we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access will not compromise or breach the technology protecting our networks or proprietary client information.\nWe process debit card transactions initiated by our customers at merchant locations around the world. When a merchant is impacted by a cyber breach, we are exposed to the risk of financial losses due to fraudulent card activity, as well as increases in associated operational expense.\nWe Rely on Third-Party Vendors for Important Aspects of Our Operation\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information and systems provided by certain key vendors, including but not limited to data processing, payroll processing, technology support, investment safekeeping and accounting. In particular, we outsource core processing to Fidelity Information Services (\"FIS\"), a leading financial services solution provider, which allows us access to competitive technology offerings without having to directly invest in development. Our ability to operate, as well as our financial condition and results of operations, could be negatively affected in the event of an interruption of an information system, an undetected error, a cyber breach, or in the event of a natural disaster whereby certain vendors are unable to maintain business continuity.\nPage-18\nFailure of Correspondent Banks and Counterparties May Affect Liquidity\nIn the economic downturn, the financial services industry in general was materially and adversely affected by the credit crisis. We have witnessed failure of banks in the industry in recent years. We rely on our correspondent banks for lines of credit, which can be revoked unexpectedly. We also have two correspondent banks as counterparties in our derivative transactions (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in item 8 in this Form 10-K). While we continually monitor the financial health of our correspondent banks and we have diverse sources of liquidity, should any one of our correspondent banks become financially impaired, our available credit may decline and/or they may be unable to honor their commitments.\nDeterioration of Credit Quality or Insolvency of Insurance Companies May Impede our Ability to Recover Losses\nThe financial crisis led certain major insurance companies to be downgraded by rating agencies. We have property, casualty and financial institution risk coverage underwritten by several insurance companies, who may not avoid insolvency risk inherent in the insurance industry. In addition, some of our investments in obligations of state and political subdivisions are insured by insurance companies. While we closely monitor the credit ratings of our insurers and the insurers of our municipal securities and we are poised to make quick changes if needed, we cannot predict an unexpected inability to honor commitments. We also invest in bank-owned life insurance policies on certain members of Management, which may lose value in the event of a carrier's insolvency. In the event that a bank-owned life insurance policy carrier's credit ratings fall below investment grade, we may exchange policies to other carriers at a cost charged by the original carrier, or we may terminate the policies which may result in adverse tax consequences.\nOur loan portfolio is secured primarily by properties located in earthquake or fire-prone zones. In the event of a disaster that causes pervasive damage to the region in which we operate, not only the Bank, but also the loan collateral may suffer losses not recoverable by insurance.\nBancorp Relies on Dividends from the Bank to Pay Cash Dividends to Shareholders\nBancorp is a separate legal entity from its subsidiary, the Bank. Bancorp receives substantially all of its revenue from the Bank in the form of dividends, which is Bancorp's principal source of funds to pay cash dividends to Bancorp's common shareholders, service subordinated debt, and cover operational expenses of the holding company. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to Bancorp. In the event that the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Bancorp, Bancorp may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders or pay interest on the subordinated debentures. As a result, it could have an adverse effect on Bancorp's stock price and investment value.\nUnder federal law, capital distributions from the Bank would become prohibited, with limited exceptions, if the Bank were categorized as \"undercapitalized\" under applicable FRB or FDIC regulations. In addition, as a California bank, Bank of Marin is subject to state law restrictions on the payment of dividends. For further information on the distribution limit from the Bank to Bancorp, see the section captioned \u201cBank Regulation\u201d in Item 1 above and \u201cDividends\u201d in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nThe Trading Volume of Bancorp's Common Stock is Less than That of Other, Larger Financial Services Companies\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Our trading volume is less than that of nationwide or larger regional financial institutions. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence of willing buyers and sellers of common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the low trading volume of our common stock, significant trades of our stock in a given time, or the expectations of these trades, could cause volatility in the stock price.\nPage-19\nWe may need to Raise Additional Capital in the Future, and if we Fail to Maintain Sufficient Capital, Whether due to Losses, an Inability to Raise Additional Capital or Otherwise, our Financial Condition, Liquidity and Results of Operations, as well as our Ability to Maintain Regulatory Compliance, Could be Adversely Affected\nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. In addition, Bancorp, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Importantly, as discussed below, regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels, which could require us to raise additional capital or contract our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be Subject to more Stringent Capital Requirements in the Future\nWe are subject to regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that we must maintain. From time to time, the regulators change these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, Bancorp or the Bank may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and we may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities.\nIn particular, the capital requirements applicable to us under the recently adopted capital rules implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States began to be phased-in starting on January 1, 2015. As these new rules take effect, we will be required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy standards than we have in the past. In addition, if we become subject to annual stress testing requirements, our stress test results may have the effect of requiring us to comply with even greater capital requirements. While we currently meet the requirements of the new Basel III-based capital rules on a fully implemented basis, we may eventually fail to do so. In addition, these requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions or make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases. Higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity.\nWe may be Subject to Environmental Liabilities in Connection with the Foreclosure on Real Estate Assets Securing our Loan Portfolio\nHazardous or toxic substances or other environmental hazards may be located on the properties that secure our loans. If we acquire such properties as a result of foreclosure or otherwise, we could become subject to various environmental liabilities. For example, we could be held liable for the cost of cleaning up or otherwise addressing contamination at or from these properties. We could also be held liable to a governmental entity or third-party for property damage, personal injury or other claims relating to any environmental contamination at or from these properties. In addition, we own and operate certain properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks. Although we have policies and procedures that are designed to mitigate against certain environmental risks, we may not detect all environmental hazards associated with these properties. If we ever became subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Small to Medium-sized Businesses that we Lend to may have Fewer Resources to Weather Adverse Business Developments, which may Impair a Borrower's Ability to Repay a Loan, and such Impairment could Adversely Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium-sized businesses. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower's ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the\nPage-20\nCalifornia markets in which we operate and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business developments, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nA Lack of Liquidity could Adversely Affect our Operations and Jeopardize our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investment securities, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds consists of deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, investment maturities and sales of investment securities and proceeds from the issuance and sale of any equity and debt securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Federal Home Loan Bank and our ability to raise brokered deposits. We also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the bank or non-bank financial services industries or the economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the bank or non-bank financial services industries.\nBased on past experience, we believe that our deposit accounts are relatively stable sources of funds. If we increase interest rates paid to retain deposits, our earnings may be adversely affected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 87476, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BMRC"}
