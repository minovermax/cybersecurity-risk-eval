Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including those described below.\nOur Development Activities Have Not Generated Significant Revenues\nAt present, our development activities include water resource and agricultural development at our San Bernardino County properties. We have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date and we do not know when, if ever, we will receive operating revenues sufficient to offset the costs of our development activities. As a result, we continue to incur a net loss from operations.\nWe May Never Generate Significant Revenues or Become Profitable Unless We Are Able to Successfully Implement Programs to Develop Our Land Assets and Related Water Resources\nWe do not know the terms, if any, upon which we may be able to proceed with our water and other development programs or successfully implement our agricultural plans. Regardless of the form of our development programs, the circumstances under which supplies or storage of water and agriculture can be developed and the profitability of any such project are subject to significant uncertainties, including the risk of variable water supplies and changing water allocation priorities. Additional risks include our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and permits, litigation by environmental or other groups, unforeseen technical difficulties, general market conditions for agricultural and water supplies, and the time needed to generate significant operating revenues from such programs after operations commence.\nThe Development of Our Properties Is Heavily Regulated, Requires Governmental Approvals and Permits That Could Be Denied, and May Have Competing Governmental Interests and Objectives\nIn developing our land assets and related water resources, we are subject to local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, resource protection, environmental impacts, infrastructure design, subdivision of land, construction and similar matters. Our development activities are subject to the risk of adverse interpretations of such U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies and/or the adoption of new and amended laws, regulations and policies that prohibits, restrict, modify or delay our development activities.\nFurther, our development activities require governmental approvals and permits. If such permits were to be denied or granted subject to unfavorable conditions or restrictions, our ability to successfully implement our development programs as planned would be adversely impacted and could delay returns on our investments in the development of our assets.\nCurrent regulation that could impact our water resources development activities are generally related to water conveyance functions, particularly the conversion of existing pipelines and construction of new pipelines and related facilities necessary to move water to and from Cadiz, or between points along these pipelines for the benefit of California water users. In this regard, we will need to obtain certain permits and approvals from public water agencies in California, the California State Lands Commission, and agencies of the federal government, such as the US Department of the Interior. Such regulatory requirements will be determined by any contractual obligation to transport water between parties via Cadiz pipeline infrastructure.\nGenerally, opposition from third parties expressed at any regulatory venue can cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely. While we have worked with representatives of various environmental and third-party stakeholders to address any concerns about our projects, certain groups may remain opposed to our development plans regardless of our engagement and pursue legal and other actions.\nGovernmental approvals and permits granted authorizing our development activities may be challenged in court and such litigation could adversely impact our timelines, development plans, and ultimately the return on our investments. Currently, our permits granted by the US Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) in December 2020 that assigned an existing right-of-way and granted a new right-of-way to us to enable the conveyance of water in our Northern Pipeline are being challenged in federal court in two lawsuits. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, below.\nOur Failure to Make Timely Payments of Principal and Interest on Our Indebtedness or To Obtain Additional Financing Will Impact our Ability to Implement Our Asset Development Programs\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total indebtedness outstanding to our lenders of approximately $50.2 million which is secured by our assets. $50.0 million of our indebtedness matures in July 2024 with interest payable quarterly in cash at a 7% annual rate. To the extent that we do not make principal and interest payments on the indebtedness when due, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of agreements governing our indebtedness, we may default on our obligations.\nWe will continue to require additional working capital to meet our cash resource needs until such time as our asset development programs, including the Water Project, produce revenues sufficient to fund operations. If we cannot raise funds if and when needed, we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company. We cannot assure you that our current lenders, or any other lenders, will give us additional credit should we seek it. If we are unable to obtain additional credit, we may engage in further financings. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on the status of our asset development programs and general conditions in the capital markets at the time funding is sought. Any further equity or convertible debt financings would result in the dilution of ownership interests of our current stockholders.\nThe Issuance of Equity Securities and Management Equity Incentive Plans Will Cause Dilution\nWe have and may continue to issue equity securities pursuant to at the market issuance sales agreements or direct placements. Further, our compensation programs for management emphasize long-term incentives, primarily through the issuance of equity securities and options to purchase equity securities. It is expected that plans involving the issuance of shares, options, or both will be submitted from time to time to our stockholders for approval. In the event that any such plans are approved and implemented, the issuance of shares and options under such plans may result in the dilution of the ownership interest of other stockholders and will, under currently applicable accounting rules, result in a charge to earnings based on the value of our common stock at the time of issue and the fair value of options at the time of their award. The expense would be recorded over the vesting period of each stock and option grant.\nThe Volatility of the Stock Price of our Equity Securities Could Adversely Affect Current and Future Stockholders\nThe market price of our common stock and depositary shares is volatile and fluctuates in response to various factors which are beyond our control. Such fluctuations are particularly common in companies such as ours, which have not generated significant revenues. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially:\n\u25cf\ndevelopments involving the execution of our business plan;\n\u25cf\ndisclosure of any adverse results in litigation;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments affecting our ability to develop our properties;\n\u25cf disruptions to the market and industry as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic and related events;\n\u25cf\nthe dilutive effect or perceived dilutive effect of additional debt or equity financings;\n\u25cf\nperceptions in the marketplace of our company and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock markets, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Price volatility could be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.", "PERMNO": 85570, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "CDZI"}
