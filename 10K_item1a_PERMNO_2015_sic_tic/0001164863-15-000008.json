If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation could be harmed. You should also consider these risk factors when you read \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d elsewhere in this report.

Those forward-looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of these risks occur.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCertain of our subsidiaries filed petitions to resolve asbestos litigation.\nThe historical business operations of certain subsidiaries of our subsidiary, Coltec Industries Inc (\u201cColtec\u201d), principally GST LLC and The Anchor Packing Company (\u201cAnchor\u201d), have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged personal injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers. Those subsidiaries manufactured and/or sold industrial sealing products, predominately gaskets and packing products, which contained encapsulated asbestos fibers. Anchor is an inactive and insolvent indirect subsidiary of Coltec. There is no remaining insurance coverage available to Anchor and it has no assets. Our subsidiaries\u2019 exposure to asbestos litigation and their relationships with insurance carriers has been actively managed through another Coltec subsidiary, Garrison Litigation Management Group, Ltd. (\u201cGarrison,\u201d collectively with GST LLC and Anchor, \u201cGST\u201d). On the Petition Date, GST LLC, Anchor and Garrison filed voluntary petitions for\nreorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d) to address these claims. These subsidiaries have been deconsolidated from our financial statements since the Petition Date. The amount that will be necessary to fully and finally resolve the asbestos liabilities of these companies is uncertain. Several risks and uncertainties result from these filings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Those risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u2022\npossible changes in the value of the deconsolidated subsidiaries reflected in our financial statements. Our investment in GST is subject to periodic reviews for impairment. To estimate the fair value, the Company considers many factors and uses both discounted cash flow and market valuation approaches. The asbestos claims value is an important part of the value of that investment. The actual value will be determined in the Chapter 11 process, either through negotiations with claimant representatives or, absent a negotiated resolution, by the Bankruptcy Court after contested proceedings, and accordingly adverse developments with respect to the terms of the resolution of such claims may materially adversely affect the value of our investment in GST;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of the number and per claim value of pending and potential future asbestos claims. On the Petition Date, according to Garrison, there were more than 90,000 total asbestos claims pending against GST LLC, of which approximately 5,800 were claims alleging the disease mesothelioma. Based on discovery in the Chapter 11 proceedings, GST has learned that more than 1,900 of those claims were not, in fact, pending mesothelioma claims. As a result of the initiation of the Chapter 11 proceedings, the resolution of asbestos claims is subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and the filing of the Chapter 11 cases automatically stayed the prosecution of pending asbestos bodily injury and wrongful death lawsuits, and initiation of new such lawsuits, against GST. An estimation trial for the purpose of estimating the number and value of allowed mesothelioma claims for plan feasibility purposes commenced on July 22, 2013 and concluded on August 22, 2013. GST, on the one hand, and the claimants\u2019 representatives, on the other hand, proposed different approaches to estimating allowed asbestos personal injury claims against GST, and the Bankruptcy Court ruled that each could present its proposed approach. GST offered a merits-based approach that focused on its legal defenses to liability and took account of claimants\u2019 recoveries from other sources, including trusts established in Chapter 11 cases filed by GST\u2019s co-defendants, in estimating potential future recoveries by claimants from GST. The claimants\u2019 representatives offered a settlement-based theory of estimation. On January 10, 2014, Bankruptcy Judge George Hodges announced his estimation decision. Citing with approval the methodology put forth by GST at trial, the judge determined that $125 million is the amount sufficient to satisfy GST's liability for present and future mesothelioma claims. The judge's liability determination is for mesothelioma claims only. The court has not yet determined amounts for GST's liability for other asbestos claims and for administrative costs that would be required to review and process claims and payments, which will increase that $125 million amount. Our recorded asbestos liability as of the Petition Date was $472.1 million. Until the second quarter of 2014, neither we nor GST endeavored to update the estimate since the Petition Date except as necessary to reflect payments of accrued fees and the disposition of cases on appeal. As a result of those necessary updates, the liability estimate as of December 31, 2013 was $466.8 million. On May 29, 2014, GST filed an amended proposed plan of reorganization and a proposed disclosure statement. That amended plan provided $275 million in total funding for (a) present and future asbestos claims against GST that have not been resolved by settlement or verdict prior to the Petition Date, and (b) administrative and litigation costs. The $275 million amount was determined based on an economic analysis of the feasibility of the proposed plan. The amended plan also provided that GST would pay in full unpaid claims that had been resolved by settlement or verdict prior to the Petition Date. GST estimates its aggregate liability for settled asbestos claims to be no more than $10 million. Given the decision of the Bankruptcy Court in January 2014 with respect to its estimate of GST\u2019s liability for present and future mesothelioma claims at $125 million and GST\u2019s filing of an amended plan of reorganization setting out its intention to fund a plan with total consideration of $285 million in May 2014, GST at that time believed that its ultimate payment to resolve all present and future asbestos claims against it would be no less than the $285 million set out in its proposed plan. Similarly, while GST believed it to be an unlikely worst case scenario, GST believes its ultimate costs to resolve all asbestos claims against it could be no more than the total value of GST. As a result, GST believed it appropriate to revise its liability estimate to the low end of the range between those two values and revised its estimate of its ultimate payment to resolve all present and future asbestos claims to $285 million. In January 2015, we announced that GST and we had reached agreement with the court-appointed legal representative of future asbestos claimants (the \"Future Claimants' Representative\") that includes a second amended proposed plan of reorganization. Under this revised plan, not less than $367.5 million will be required to fund the resolution of all GST asbestos claims, $30 million of which will be funded by Coltec. The Future Claimants' Representative has agreed to support, recommend and vote in favor of the revised plan. If approved by the Bankruptcy Court and implemented, the revised plan will provide certainty and finality to the expenditures necessary to resolve all current and future asbestos claims against GST. As a result, GST believes the low end of the reasonably possible range of values that will be necessary for it to fund to resolve all present and future claims is now $337.5 million. Accordingly, GST has revised its estimate of its ultimate asbestos liability to $337.5 million. Of GST\u2019s\nestimate of liability of $337.5 million, $77.5 million represents contributions required under the January 2015 revised plan of reorganization to be made to a settlement facility to be established under the revised plan over seven years following the consummation of the plan. In addition, the revised plan of reorganization provides that, during the 40-year period following consummation of the revised plan, GST would, if necessary, make supplementary annual contributions, subject to specified maximum annual amounts that decline over the period, to maintain a specified balance at specified dates of a litigation fund to be established under the plan to fund the defense and payment of claims of claimants who elect to pursue litigation under the plan rather than accept the settlement option under the plan. The maximum aggregate amount of all such contingent supplementary contributions over that period is $132 million. GST\u2019s estimate of its ultimate asbestos liability of $337.5 million does not include any amount of these contingent supplementary contributions as GST believes that initial contributions to the litigation fund may likely be sufficient to permit the balance of that facility to exceed the specified thresholds over the 40-year period and, accordingly, that the low end of a range of reasonably possible loss associated with these contingent supplementary contributions is $0;\n\u2022\nthe financial viability of our subsidiaries\u2019 insurance carriers and their reinsurance carriers, and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to collect on claims from them. Agreements with certain of these insurance carriers and the terms of applicable policies define specific annual amounts to be paid or limit the amount that can be recovered in any one year, and accordingly substantial insurance payments for submitted claims have been deferred and are payable in installments through 2018, and an additional $36.9 million of other insurance payments may be payable only upon the conclusion of the bankruptcy process;\n\u2022\nthe potential for asbestos exposure to extend beyond the filed entities arising from corporate veil piercing efforts or other claims by asbestos plaintiffs. During the course of the proceedings before the Bankruptcy Court, the claimant representatives have asserted that affiliates of GST, including the Company and Coltec, should be held responsible for the asbestos liabilities of GST under various theories of derivative corporate responsibility including veil-piercing and alter ego. Claimant representatives filed a motion with the bankruptcy court asking for permission to sue us based on those theories. In a decision dated June 7, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court denied the claimant representatives\u2019 motion without prejudice, thereby potentially allowing the representatives to re-file the motion. Under GST\u2019s revised plan of reorganization and pursuant to an agreement that we have reached with GST, all claims against affiliates based on GST asbestos claims, including any corporate veil piercing, alter ego or other derivative claims, are settled in exchange for the payment of $30 million by Coltec and other consideration under the plan; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of the bankruptcy proceeding and the length of time necessary to resolve the case, either through settlement or various court proceedings. Through December 31, 2014, GST has recorded Chapter 11 case-related fees and expenses totaling $118.5 million. We have recorded an additional $7.2 million in case-related fees and expenses incurred directly by EnPro and Coltec.\nFor a further discussion of the filings and the asbestos exposure of our subsidiaries, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview and Outlook,\u201d \u201c- Contingencies - Asbestos\u201d and \u201c- Contingencies - Subsidiary Bankruptcy,\u201d and Notes 18 and 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report.\nWe cannot assure you that GST will be able to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of its revised plan of reorganization and the settlement and resolution of claims and related releases of liability embodied therein or what the final terms of such plan will be at consummation, and the time period for the resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings is not presently determinable.\nOn January 14, 2015, GST filed a revised plan of reorganization that provides for (a) the resolution of present and future asbestos claims against GST, and (b) administrative and litigation costs. The plan incorporates the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s determination in January 2014 that $125 million is sufficient to satisfy GST\u2019s aggregate liability for present and future mesothelioma claims; however, it also provides additional funds to provide full payment for non-mesothelioma claims and to gain the support of the Future Claimants\u2019 Representative of the plan. The revised plan of reorganization provides for the establishment of two facilities-a settlement facility (which would receive contributions of $220 million from GST and $30 million from Coltec upon consummation of the plan and additional contributions from GST aggregating $77.5 million plus interest over the seven years following consummation of the plan) and a litigation fund (which would receive $30 million from GST upon consummation of the plan) to fund the defense and payment of claims of claimants who elect to pursue litigation under the plan rather than accept the settlement option under the plan. Funds contained in the settlement facility and the litigation fund would provide the exclusive remedies for current and future GST asbestos claimants other than claimants whose claims had been resolved by settlement or verdict prior to the Petition Date and were not paid prior to the Petition Date. The plan provides that GST will pay in full claims that had been resolved by settlement or verdict prior to the Petition Date that were not paid prior to the Petition Date (with respect to claims resolved by verdict, such payment will be made only to the extent the verdict becomes final). The amount of such claims resolved by verdict is $2.5 million. GST estimates the range of\nits aggregate liability for the unpaid settled asbestos claims to be from $3.1 million to $16.4 million, and the revised plan provides that if the actual amount is less than $10.0 million GST will contribute the difference to the settlement facility. In addition, the revised plan provides that, during the 40-year period following confirmation of the plan, GST would, if necessary, make supplementary annual contributions, subject to specified maximum annual amounts that decline over the period, to maintain a specified balance at specified dates of the litigation fund. The maximum aggregate amount of all such contingent supplementary contributions over that period is $132 million. Under the plan, EnPro would guarantee GST\u2019s payment of the $77.5 million of deferred contributions plus accrued interest to the settlement facility and, to the extent they are required, the supplementary contributions to the litigation fund. Under the terms of the plan, EnPro would retain 100% of the equity interests of GST LLC. The plan also provides for the extinguishment of all derivative claims against us based on GST asbestos products and operations.\nThe revised plan has not yet been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court (and other necessary approvals have not been obtained), and there is no certainty that the Bankruptcy Court will confirm the plan (or grant other necessary preliminary approvals) or that the conditions to effectiveness of the plan will be satisfied or waived. The failure of the plan to be confirmed and/or to be consummated could result in, among other consequences, the pursuit of an alternative form of reorganization or liquidation, which may be less favorable to GST and to us. Confirmation and consummation of the plan are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties that have an interest in the bankruptcy proceedings, delays in the confirmation or effective date of a plan of reorganization due to factors beyond GST's or our control, which would result in greater costs and the impairment of value of GST, objections and other challenges to the confirmation of the plan, including appeals, and risks and uncertainties affecting GST and Coltec's ability to fund anticipated contributions under the plan as a result of adverse changes in their results of operations, financial condition and capital resources, including as a result of economic factors beyond their control. The process of confirming the plan or an alternative plan of reorganization generally mandates that certain requirements, including with respect to the adequacy of disclosure and solicitation of acceptances, must be met. Under the Bankruptcy Code, to confirm a plan of reorganization, a bankruptcy court must conclude, among other things, that (i) the plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law; (ii) confirmation of the plan is not likely be followed by a liquidation or need for further financial reorganization, (iii) the value of distributions to non-accepting holders of claims within a particular class under such plan will not be less than the value of distributions such holders would receive under Chapter 7 liquidation, and (iv) each class of claims that is impaired by the plan has accepted the plan. In addition, even if all classes of impaired claims have not accepted a plan, a bankruptcy court may nevertheless confirm a plan so long as (i) at least one impaired class has accepted such plan and (ii) such plan does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable with respect to each impaired class of claimants that has not accepted such plan.\nGST contends that all classes of claims, including asbestos claims, are not impaired under the second amended plan because the plan provides for payment in full of the allowed amounts of all claims and does not otherwise alter the rights of holders of claims. GST further contends that, because the Bankruptcy Code provides that classes of unimpaired claims are deemed to accept a plan, the Bankruptcy Court may confirm the plan without soliciting formal acceptance of classes of creditors, including the class of present asbestos claims. If the Bankruptcy Court disagrees with GST and determines that the class of present asbestos claims is impaired under the second amended plan and if such class does not accept the plan, GST believes that the Bankruptcy Court may nevertheless confirm such plan because the Bankruptcy Court may conclude that the support of the Future Claimants' Representative on behalf of the class of future claimants provides an accepting impaired class and the plan does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable to the class of present asbestos claimants. There can be no assurance, however, that the Bankruptcy Court will accept GST\u2019s contentions and confirm the second amended plan or that, if the Bankruptcy Court does confirm the plan, that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order doing so will be upheld on appeal. If the second amended plan is not confirmed and an alternative reorganization plan and/or settlement cannot be agreed upon, the ultimate outcome and the timing of resolution of the case would be highly uncertain. In that circumstance, there remains a possibility that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s liability estimate could be reversed on appeal and subsequently revised, and that GST could eventually be forced to liquidate, although we believe an eventual GST liquidation to be highly unlikely. However, we cannot assure you that GST will not have to liquidate, and that, in the event of reversal on appeal of the liability estimate, GST's assets will be sufficient to satisfy all claims against it, in which case claims that would otherwise have been resolved under GST's second amended plan may be brought against us.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that GST will be able to obtain necessary Bankruptcy Court approval of the second amended plan or that the plan will be consummated or that the terms and conditions of any reorganization plan that may ultimately be consummated will be similar to the plan. In addition, in each asbestos-driven Chapter 11 case that has been resolved previously, the amount of the debtor\u2019s liability has been determined as part of a consensual plan of reorganization agreed to by the debtor, its asbestos claimants and a legal representative for potential future claimants. In the absence of such a consensual arrangement, the GST asbestos claims resolution process remains uncertain and could take an undetermined time to complete and could materially adversely affect us in other ways.\nEven if the amended proposed plan of reorganization is confirmed, we may be subject to claims that were not settled or discharged in GST\u2019s bankruptcy cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nWe expect that substantially any GST asbestos-related claims that arose prior to the Petition Date and that might be asserted against us as an affiliate of GST will be resolved and settled during GST\u2019s Chapter 11 proceedings. Pursuant to the revised plan of reorganization, the provisions of the plan would constitute a good-faith resolution of any such claims by asbestos claimants against GST and against us to the extent arising from GST\u2019s products or operations, and the entry of the order confirming the plan will constitute the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s approval of such resolution of all such claims. Circumstances in which claims and/or other obligations against us that arose prior to the Petition Date that would otherwise be settled as part of the plan may not be discharged include instances where particular claimants are found to have received inadequate notice of the plan and/or the proposed treatment of asbestos claims embodied therein, where the claim is not derivative of the liability of GST, such as where those claims are against our subsidiaries other than GST based upon allegations of exposure to asbestos contained in their products, or where claimants have made workers' compensation claims based on allegations of exposure to asbestos during the course of their employment. Prior to the Petition Date, several thousand of those claims against Coltec were dismissed without payment. Several thousand others were pending on the Petition Date but were stayed by the Bankruptcy Court during the pendency of GST's bankruptcy proceeding but would not be discharged under the terms of GST LLC\u2019s amended plan of reorganization. Coltec has never paid any indemnity dollars to resolve any such claim, but there can be no assurance that it will not be required to pay such a claim in the future.\nOur business and some of the markets we serve are cyclical and distressed market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe markets in which we sell our products, particularly chemical companies, petroleum refineries, heavy-duty trucking, semiconductor manufacturing, capital equipment and the automotive industry, are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns. Prior downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices in these markets resulting in negative effects on our net sales, gross margins and net income. The recent recession affected our results of operations. A prolonged and severe downward cycle in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face intense competition that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe encounter intense competition in almost all areas of our businesses. Customers for many of our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce inventories. To remain competitive, we need to invest continuously in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. We also need to develop new products to continue to meet the needs and desires of our customers. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position. Additionally, some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Certain of our products may also experience transformation from unique branded products to undifferentiated price sensitive products. This product commoditization may be accelerated by low cost foreign competition. Changes in the replacement cycle of certain of our products, including because of improved product quality or improved maintenance, may affect aftermarket demand for such products. Initiatives designed to distinguish our products through superior service, continuous improvement, innovation, customer relationships, technology, new product acquisitions, bundling with key services, long-term contracts or market focus may not be effective. Pricing and other competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely to market our products, we may be unable to effectively market our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.\nThe marketing success of many of our businesses in the U.S. and abroad depends largely upon our independent agents\u2019 and distributors\u2019 sales and service expertise and relationships with customers in our markets. Many of these agents have developed strong ties to existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of our products. A loss of a significant number of these agents or distributors, or of a particular agent or distributor in a key market or with key customer relationships, could significantly inhibit our ability to effectively market our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased costs for raw materials, the termination of existing supply agreements or disruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe prices for some of the raw materials we purchase increased in 2014. While we have been successful in passing along some or all of these higher costs, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue doing so without losing customers. Additionally, our Power Systems segment has entered into long-term contracts to manufacture and sell engines which do not allow for price adjustments to recover additional costs resulting from increases in the costs of materials and components during the contract period, and accordingly material increases in relevant costs could adversely affect the profitability of these long-term contracts and the profits of that segment. Similarly, the loss of a key supplier or the unavailability of a key raw material could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nReductions in the U.S. Navy\u2019s requirements for engines offered by Fairbanks Morse Engine could materially adversely affect the results of our Power Systems segment and our business with the U.S. Navy and other governmental agencies is subject to government contracting risks.\nSales of new engines for use by the U.S. Navy by our Power Systems segment, which have been a significant component of that segment\u2019s revenues, are based on the U.S. Navy\u2019s long-term ship-building programs. We currently anticipate that the U.S. Navy\u2019s requirements for new engines of this type are likely to decline, which decline may be exacerbated by any curtailment in military budgets affecting the U.S. Navy\u2019s ship-building programs. Although the Power Systems segment has expanded its activities in other markets, including the sale of diesel engine generator sets for emergency back-up power at nuclear power plants in France and the establishment of an exclusive distribution arrangement with a German engine manufacturer in the power generation industry in the U.S., any such decline in demand from the U.S. Navy could materially adversely affect the results of our Power Systems segment.\nOur business with the U.S. Navy, and other governmental agencies, including sales to prime contractors that supply these agencies, is subject to government contracting risks. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. In addition, if we or one of our divisions were charged with wrongdoing with respect to a U.S. government contract, the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages, and/or bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of U.S. government contracts and void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct.\nWe have exposure to some contingent liabilities relating to previously owned businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any fiscal period.\nWe have contingent liabilities related to previously owned businesses of our predecessors, including environmental liabilities and liabilities for certain products and other matters. In some instances we have indemnified others against those liabilities, and in other instances we have received indemnities from third parties against those liabilities.\nClaims could arise relating to products or other matters related to our discontinued operations. Some of these claims could seek substantial monetary payments. For example, we could potentially be subject to the liabilities related to environmental liabilities associated with the pre-1983 operations of Crucible Steel Corporation a/k/a Crucible, Inc., the firearms manufactured prior to March 1990 by Colt Firearms, a former operation of Coltec, and electrical transformers manufactured prior to May 1994 by Central Moloney, another former Coltec operation. Coltec has ongoing obligations with regard to workers compensation, retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters associated with discontinued operations in connection with Coltec\u2019s periods of ownership of those operations.\nWe have insurance, reserves, and funds held in trust to address some of these liabilities. However, if our insurance coverage is depleted, our reserves are not adequate, or the funds held in trust are insufficient, environmental and other liabilities relating to discontinued operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe conduct a significant amount of our sales activities outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks, including foreign exchange risks, that may cause our profitability to decline.\nBecause we sell our products in a number of foreign countries, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. In 2014, we derived approximately 45% of our net sales from sales of our products outside of the U.S. Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nunfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including long-term contracts denominated in foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in foreign tax, legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ncultural norms and expectations that may sometimes be inconsistent with our Code of Conduct and our requirements about the manner in which our employees, agents and distributors conduct business;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including instabilities associated with European sovereign debt uncertainties and the future continuity of membership of the European Union; and\n\u2022\nacts of hostility, terror or war.\nAny of these factors, individually or together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations. For example, our operations in countries outside the United States are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits United States companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity, or obtain any unfair advantage. Our activities in countries outside the United States create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of the FCPA, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. We have internal control policies and procedures and have implemented training and compliance programs with respect to the FCPA. However, we cannot assure that our policies, procedures and programs always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. In addition, we are subject to and must comply with all applicable export controls and economic sanctions laws and embargoes imposed by the United States and other various governments. Changes in export control or trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs and increase compliance costs, and violations of these laws or regulations may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions, such as loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business or debarments from export privileges. Violations of the FCPA or export controls or sanctions laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe intend to continue to pursue international growth opportunities, which could increase our exposure to risks associated with international sales and operations. As we expand our international operations, we may also encounter new risks that could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. For example, as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions, we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local agents, distributors and trading companies. If we are not successful in developing these relationships, we may not be able to increase sales in these regions.\nFailure to properly manage these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and knowledge relating to our products, our business and prospects may be negatively impacted.\nWe believe that proprietary products and technology are important to our success. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and know-how, our business and prospects could be negatively impacted. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality, non-\ncompete and nondisclosure agreements and other measures may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights. Patents issued to third parties, whether before or after the issue date of our patents, could render our intellectual property less valuable. Questions as to whether our competitors\u2019 products infringe our intellectual property rights or whether our products infringe our competitors\u2019 intellectual property rights may be disputed. In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some jurisdictions, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share in those jurisdictions.\nOur competitors may capture market share from us by selling products that claim to mirror the capabilities of our products or technology. Without sufficient protection nationally and internationally for our intellectual property, our competitiveness worldwide could be impaired, which would negatively impact our growth and future revenue. As a result, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions, which could involve certain risks and uncertainties.\nWe expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges, such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities, properly evaluating risks and other diligence matters, ensuring adequate capital availability and balancing other resource constraints. There are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions, including: difficulties integrating acquired technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems; unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business; unrealized synergies and cost savings; unknown or underestimated liabilities; diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses and potential loss of key management employees of the acquired business. In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions.\nOur business may be impacted by information technology disruptions, including information technology attacks. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our systems from information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by numerous other risks, including rising healthcare costs, changes in environmental laws and other unforeseen business interruptions.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by numerous other risks. For example, medical and healthcare costs may continue to increase. Initiatives to address these costs, such as consumer driven health plan packages, may not successfully reduce these expenses as needed. Failure to offer competitive employee benefits may result in our inability to recruit or maintain key employees. Other risks to our business include potential changes in environmental rules or regulations, which could negatively impact our manufacturing processes. Use of certain chemicals and other substances could become restricted or such changes may otherwise require us to incur additional costs which could reduce our profitability and impair our ability to offer competitively priced products. Additional risks to our business include global or local events which could significantly disrupt our operations. Terrorist attacks, natural disasters, political insurgencies, pandemics and electrical grid disruptions and outages are some of the unforeseen risks that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nA relatively small number of shares traded in any one day could have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this section and elsewhere in this report or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by\nindustry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability.\nBecause our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in future periods, our stock price may fluctuate.\nOur revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant selling and manufacturing costs. Small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock may fall. We may also incur charges to income to cover increases in the estimate of our subsidiaries\u2019 future asbestos liability. Other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products;\n\u2022\nthe timing and execution of customer contracts;\n\u2022\nthe timing of sales of our products;\n\u2022\nincreases in manufacturing costs due to equipment or labor issues;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable tax rates;\n\u2022\nan impairment in the value of our investment in GST;\n\u2022\nan impairment of goodwill at our Compressor Products International reporting unit or other business;\n\u2022\nunanticipated delays or problems in introducing new products;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of contractual penalties for the late delivery of long lead-time products;\n\u2022\nannouncements by competitors of new products, services or technological innovations;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, raw materials or supplies, product development or administration;\n\u2022\nmajor changes in the level of economic activity in major regions of the world in which we do business;\n\u2022\ncosts related to possible future acquisitions or divestitures of technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\nan increase in the number or magnitude of product liability or environmental claims;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations, particularly outside the U.S.; and\n\u2022\neconomic assumptions and market factors used to determine post-retirement benefits and pension liabilities.\nVarious provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of North Carolina law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management. In particular, our articles of incorporation and bylaws, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire a supermajority shareholder vote to approve any business combination transaction with an owner of 5% or more of our shares unless the transaction is recommended by disinterested directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the right of shareholders to remove directors and fill vacancies;\n\u2022\nregulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders\u2019 meetings; and\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of our convertible debentures.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. In addition, a reasonable number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans, including shares to be issued upon the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock or unit grants, and upon conversion of our convertible debentures. We\ncannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the debentures and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur debt agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes impose limitations on our operations, which could impede our ability to respond to market conditions, address unanticipated capital investments and/or pursue business opportunities.\nThe agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes impose limitations on our operations, such as limitations on certain restricted payments, investments, incurrence or repayment of indebtedness, and maintenance of a consolidated net leverage ratio and an interest coverage financial ratio. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains limitations on certain restricted payments, investments and incurrence or repayment of indebtedness. These limitations could impede our ability to respond to market conditions, address unanticipated capital investment needs and/or pursue business opportunities.\nWe may not have sufficient cash to fund a required repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control.\nUpon a change of control, as defined under the indenture governing the senior notes and includes events that may be beyond our control, the holders of the senior notes have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the senior notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, we expect that we would have to refinance the senior notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the senior notes on reasonable terms, if at all. Our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt.", "PERMNO": 89406, "SIC": 3050, "TIC": "NPO"}
