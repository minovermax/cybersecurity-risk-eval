{"cik": "1003201", "company": "MMA Capital Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common shares involves various risks and uncertainties. The risks described in this section are among those that, as of the filing date of this Report, could, directly or indirectly, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as on the value of our common shares.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face risks associated with our investments in the Energy Capital portfolio.\nOur Energy Capital portfolio invests in late-stage development, construction and permanent loans, directly or through the Solar Ventures, that finance renewable energy projects to enable developers, design and build contractors and system owners to develop, build and operate renewable energy systems throughout North America. This portfolio is subject to construction risk, permanent financing risk, repayment risk and collateral risks (such as value and ability to foreclose). In addition, federal and state governments have established various incentives and financial mechanisms to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy. These incentives include tax credits, tax abatements and rebates among others. These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in solar and other renewable energy. Changes in government incentives, whether at the federal or local level, could adversely affect our renewable energy finance business. In addition, changes in federal law, including the 2018 tariff on solar panels, could adversely affect our renewable energy lending business. Furthermore, the ability of the Solar Ventures and the Company to fund our development or construction loan commitments is currently and may become increasingly dependent upon the repayment of other, similar loans in which we invest. Repayment of such loans is often dependent upon permanent loans, tax credit equity and other monetization events whose funding is outside of our control. Furthermore, lenders of permanent loans and syndicators of tax credit equity may require access to the credit markets, which could impact their ability to finance the take-out of loans of the Solar Ventures. Moreover, there are risks associated with the nature of the Solar Ventures including: (i) we do not control SCL, SDL and SPL, and our investment partner may not consent to decisions that may be in our best interest; (ii) either the Company or our investment partner may fail to meet its funding obligations to SCL, SDL and SPL to fund new or unfunded loan commitments of such ventures (as of December 31, 2018, SCL, SDL and SPL had $89.1 million of unfunded loan commitments to borrowers); (iii) repaid investments of the Solar Ventures may be unable to be reinvested at attractive risk adjusted returns and (iv) lower than expected returns may be generated by the Solar Ventures due to idle capital costs.\nWe are exposed to the risk that Hunt may fail to meet its payment obligations to us in connection with financing that we provided to facilitate the Disposition.\nOn January 8, 2018, the Company provided seller financing associated with the Disposition and received a $57.0 million note from Hunt that had an initial term of seven years, is prepayable at any time and bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum. The UPB of the Company\u2019s receivable from Hunt increased by $10.0 million on October 4, 2018, upon the closing under the MGM Agreements. The Company\u2019s total receivable from Hunt will amortize in 20 equal quarterly payments of $3.35 million beginning on March 31, 2020. This note has certain net worth, leverage ratio, debt service coverage ratio and interest coverage ratio covenants. Notwithstanding these financial covenants, to the extent Hunt does not meet its payment obligations under the terms of the note it could result in a decrease in our anticipated cash flow which could impact our ability to make new investments, or a decline in the rate of growth of such investments, any of which could adversely impact our revenues, cash flows and financial condition. If Hunt fails to repay the note and we are unable to realize the value of the collateral, our business, cash flows and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIncreases in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely affect the fair value of our assets and increase our costs of borrowing.\nOur Bond-Related Investments and other fixed rate financial instruments, which include loans held-for-sale and derivative financial instruments, are reported at fair value in our financial statements based upon, in part, estimated market yields and credit spreads for comparable investments. Consequently, the fair value of such instruments expose us to changes in interest rates and credit spreads.\nInterest rates can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. Interest rates can also fluctuate as a result of geopolitical events or changes in general economic conditions, including events or conditions that alter investor demand for Treasury or other fixed-income securities.\nChanges in market conditions, including changes in interest rates, liquidity, prepayment and/or default expectations, and the level of uncertainty in the market for a particular asset class, may cause fluctuations in credit spreads.\nIf interest rates increase or credit spreads widen, the fair value of our investments in bonds and other fixed rate financial instruments (whose fair value measurements are based upon contractual cash flows) will generally decline and, therefore, have a negative effect on our financial results and our shareholders\u2019 equity. Declines in the fair value of these instruments could be significant in such circumstances.\nIf short-term interest rates rise, our borrowing costs would increase and our net income would decline as interest payments associated with a significant portion of our debt obligations are indexed to short-term interest rates and, therefore, would increase. However, the Company may, from time to time, enter into agreements with third parties that are designed to manage a portion of this risk.\nChanges in capitalization and discount rates may adversely impact the fair value of our investments in non-performing bonds, investments in subordinated cash flow bonds and other real estate-related investments.\nFor non-performing bonds and subordinated cash flow bonds that are reported at fair value in our financial statements, the Company generally measures the fair value of such instruments based upon internally-generated, 10 year projections of future net operating income from the underlying properties that serve as collateral for such instruments (a terminal value is added to these projections to estimate remaining property value that is expected to be realized at the end of the projection period). In this regard, an increase in capitalization and discount rates generally would cause a decline in the fair value of these investments, as well as that of our other real estate-related investments.\nThe magnitude of changes in the value of our real estate-related interests could vary from market to market as a result of differences in capitalization and discount rates.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may not be available after 2021, which creates uncertainty around the future value and cost of certain interest rate derivative instruments and debt obligations.\nThe payment terms of our subordinated debt and certain interest rate derivative instruments that we use to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk are indexed to LIBOR. However, it is widely expected that LIBOR will not be quoted or available after 2021. It is also widely expected that an alternate reference rate will be adopted on an industry-wide basis in the derivatives market and that market participants will adopt the alternate rate and agree to apply it to existing, as well as future, interest rate derivative contracts, but there can be no assurance this will happen or that we and the counterparty to our interest rate derivative contracts will be in agreement on the new rate. In any event, it is unlikely that the new rate will be exactly equal to what LIBOR would have been, so the amount paid to us under our cap and interest rate swap agreements might be less than it would have been had LIBOR continued.\nOur subordinated debt documents contain alternative reference bank quotation mechanisms in the event LIBOR is discontinued, but there can be no assurance that such banks will quote an alternate rate. If they do not, and we do not otherwise reach agreement with the servicers or the lenders on such debt, the debt will convert to a fixed rate equal to the last quoted LIBOR plus our existing spread. Accordingly, it is impossible at this time to predict what our interest cost will be after 2021. The cost could be greater than it would have been had LIBOR continued and the difference could be material to our financial results.\nTRSs are important to financing our bond investments and for other purposes and we are exposed to various risks associated with such agreements.\nA TRS is an agreement that requires one party to make interest payments based on either a fixed or floating rate of interest in exchange for payments from its counterparty that are based on the return of a referenced asset that is typically an index, a loan or a bond. The Company has financed its ownership of a majority of its investments in bonds through such agreements, which are all with one financial institution. All payments under this type of agreement are calculated based upon contractually-specified notional amounts. In a typical TRS agreement, we are required to make interest payments that are based on a floating rate of interest and our counterparty is required to make payments to us that reflect the total return associated with a referenced asset. Cash flows associated with this type of agreement are subject to risks associated with the referenced asset (including interest rate and real estate-related risks) and are exposed to the credit risk of both the obligor on the referenced asset and our counterparty to a TRS agreement. To the extent the fair value of a referenced asset\ndeclines, we are at risk of having to provide additional collateral to our TRS counterparty. If we were unable to post additional collateral in such circumstances, the referenced asset might be sold at a time when its full value could not be achieved and our existing collateral would be at risk of being retained by our TRS counterparty. As the TRS agreements mature or are terminated, we need to make our counterparty whole and to the extent that the referenced asset value is less than the notional amount of the TRS, we would need to pay the difference in cash and if we are unable to do so, we have the risk of our collateral being retained.\nCash flows from our bond investments and our other real estate-related investments are exposed to various risks associated with real estate to which our investments are related.\nBecause a substantial portion of our investments in bonds and other real-estate related investments are secured by real estate or consist of real estate or investments in entities that own real estate, the value of these investments is exposed to various real estate-related risks. Most of these investments are directly or indirectly secured by multifamily rental properties and, therefore, the value of these investments may be adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions or other developments in real estate markets. These factors include (but are not limited to): (i) increasing levels of unemployment and other, adverse regional or national economic conditions; (ii) decreased occupancy and rent levels due to supply and demand imbalances; (iii) changes in interest rates that affect the value of the real estate we own or in which we have an interest and (iv) lack of or reduced availability of mortgage financing.\nThe value of most of our real estate-related investments is based upon cash flows generated by tenant leases. The majority of the properties that we have financed or in which we have invested have rent limitations that could adversely affect the ability to increase rents. The majority of such properties also have tenant income restrictions that may reduce the number of eligible tenants and, as a result, occupancy rates at such properties could decline. If tenants move out or cannot pay the rents charged on the specific units they lease, the owners (our borrowers and partners) may be unable to lease the units to replacement tenants at full rent (or at all). In such circumstances, cash flows from such properties may not be sufficient to pay interest on our bonds or loans, which would cause the value of our investments to decline.\nReal estate may also decline in value because of adverse changes in market conditions, environmental problems, casualty losses for which insurance proceeds are not sufficient to cover the loss, or condemnation proceedings. The value of our real estate-related investments and our ability to conduct business also may be adversely affected by changes in local or national laws or regulatory conditions that affect significant segments of the real estate market, especially the multifamily housing market. These local or national laws or regulatory conditions specifically include environmental, land use and other laws and regulations that affect the cost of maintaining and operating the properties in which we have an interest.\nWe are exposed to various risks associated with agreements that we use to manage interest rate risk.\nFrom time to time, we may execute agreements that are designed to reduce our interest rate risk. For example, we may enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to pay a fixed rate of interest and the counterparty agrees to pay us a floating rate of interest in order to synthetically fix our variable rate debt to better match assets that pay on a fixed rate basis. We also may enter into interest rate caps whereby we pay the counterparty an upfront premium and the counterparty pays us if the benchmark rate on the cap reaches a certain level. As further discussed above, derivative instruments are exposed to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates. Additionally, interest rate swaps and caps expose the Company to the risk of counterparty default (including counterparty failure to meet its payment obligations). Further, there is a risk that these contracts do not perform as expected and may cost more than the benefits we receive. Moreover, in the case of interest rate swaps, we are exposed to the risk of collateral calls if the fair value of such agreements declines.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our shareholder value over the long term would be adversely affected if we are unable to raise capital, if our capital partners fail to meet their funding commitments to us or if we are unable to make new investments.\nWe need to identify, attract and obtain new capital in order to increase the number and size of the investments that we make. Our ability to raise capital depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are outside our control. There can be no assurances that we can find or secure commitments for new capital or that new or existing capital partners will meet their funding commitments to us. The failure to obtain or maintain capital in sufficient amounts, or to realize sufficient returns on the Company\u2019s current investments, as well as the failure to reinvest investment or capital proceeds into new higher yielding investments could result in a decrease in the number and dollar value of our investments, or a decline in the rate of growth of such investments, any of which could adversely impact our revenues, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, we and our Solar Venture partner may need to contribute additional funds to the Solar Ventures to enable them to meet their funding commitments to borrowers. If we do not have the capital to meet our funding obligations, or if our capital partner fails to meet its funding obligations, our Solar Ventures could default on their lending commitments and our reputation, our ability to make new investments and our cash flows could all be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, there is a risk that we will not be able to deploy our cash or the cash held by the Solar Ventures or expand our leverage to make investments that generate risk-adjusted returns that grow shareholder value. Furthermore, because there are no restrictions as to the nature of our investments, our investments in the future may result in additional or new risks that we do not face today.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, directly and indirectly affected by disruptions in credit markets.\nDisruptions in credit markets may cause significant deterioration in the market for tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other debt instruments that are part of our assets and may play a role in our reinvestment strategy. This has in the past and may in the future result in our having to reduce the carrying value of our bonds and other receivables associated with our lending activities. We are also dependent upon our capital partner to extend existing TRS agreements upon their maturity. If we were unsuccessful in renewing such agreements, we may be forced to create liquidity in an unfavorable market which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nVirtually all of our non-cash assets are illiquid and may be difficult to sell at their reported carrying values.\nOur renewable energy investments, bonds, direct and indirect investments in real estate and other debt investments are illiquid and difficult to value. In particular, our investments in bonds are unenhanced and unrated and, as a consequence, there is a relatively small trading market for these instruments. The relative lack of liquidity in the market for our bond investments complicates our ability to measure their fair value and that of other debt investments. Therefore, there is a risk that if we need to sell any of these assets, the price that we are able to realize may be lower than their carrying value in our financial statements.\nComprehensive tax reform and other legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Tax Act introduced significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe Tax Act provides, among other things, for a reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, which could adversely affect the market for and value of our tax-exempt bond related investments and the desire of tax credit investors to invest in solar tax credits that support our Energy Capital portfolio. In addition, the majority of our tax-exempt bonds produce income that has traditionally been subject to the alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) for both individuals and corporations. Although the corporate AMT was eliminated by the Tax Act, the individual AMT continues, though with a higher AMT exemption beginning in tax years after December 31, 2017. Marginal tax brackets for individuals were changed with a new maximum marginal tax rate of 37% versus the prior 39.6%. These changes may also impact the value of our investments.\nIn addition, the government could make further changes in tax or other laws, such as affordable housing incentive programs, that while not directly affecting our tax-exempt bonds, could make them less valuable to investors. For example, if tariffs on solar panels were increased, or if federal or state incentives were reduced or eliminated, our renewable energy business could be adversely affected. Similarly, if the federal government were to further lower marginal federal income\ntax rates or phase out the tax-exempt nature of the interest income for all or higher income taxpayers, our bonds would likely decline in value. Congress could also pass laws that make competing investments more attractive than our solar projects and tax-exempt bonds, which could also make our investments less valuable.\nOur Bond-Related Investments may not retain their tax-exempt status.\nOn the date of initial issuance of any tax-exempt bond that we hold, bond counsel or special tax counsel rendered its opinion that interest on the bond is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. However, under certain circumstances, our bonds could lose their tax-exempt status subsequent to issuance. While we take steps to ensure that these circumstances do not occur, there can be no guarantees that the tax-exempt status will be maintained. If our bonds were to lose their tax-exempt status, then the fair value of these investments would decline. In this case, if a bond was the referenced asset in a TRS financing, the TRS would terminate, thereby causing us to reacquire such bonds at fair value while we would also be obligated to pay any difference required to settle the TRS. If we did not purchase a bond in such circumstances, our counterparty could sell it and, if its value at the inception of the TRS agreement was not realized upon sale, we would also be obligated to pay any difference required to settle a TRS agreement and our TRS collateral would be at risk.\nOne of our Bond-Related Investments is 30 or more days past due while other bond investments are at risk of becoming 30 or more days past due in payment of principal and/or interest.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the aggregate UPB of the bond investment that was 30 or more days past due in either principal and/or interest was $9.9 million, or approximately 10.7% of our bond investments. We report this defaulted bond investment at its fair value, which takes into consideration a borrower\u2019s default. However, amounts we realize could be even less than such estimates if foreclosures were pursued or if our borrower filed for bankruptcy protection. Additionally, properties collateralizing certain performing bonds have net operating income (as represented in operating statements provided by the borrowing partnerships), which is less than the debt service owed to us. These bonds are at risk of default if the partners of the borrowing partnerships are unable or unwilling to continue to cover the shortfall in order to pay the full debt service.\nWe could lose the tax benefit of our NOLs.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had an estimated $396.1 million of federal NOLs that were subject to a full valuation allowance at such reporting date. Our federal NOLs can be used to offset federal taxable income for the foreseeable future. However, there are events that could cause us to lose, or to otherwise limit, the amount of NOLs available to us. For example, our NOLs could be lost if we suffer a change of control event as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. A change of control event may occur when a shareholder, or a collection of shareholders, owning at least five percent of our shares, acquire more than 50% of our outstanding shares within a three-year period. The Company adopted a Tax Benefits Rights Agreement on May 5, 2015 (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) in an attempt to avoid a change of control event as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, although the Company cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the Rights Plan. Changes in tax laws could also cause us to lose, or could otherwise limit, the amount of NOLs available to us.\nOur NOLs are also subject to a 20-year carryforward limitation that limits the time that we have to generate the income necessary to fully utilize our NOLs. In this regard, it is possible that some of our NOLs will become permanently impaired if the Company is unable to generate the income required to utilize all of our NOLs before their expiration period begins in 2028.\nIf we become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), we could be required to sell substantial portions of our assets at a time when we might not otherwise want to do so, and we could incur significant losses as a result.\nWe continuously monitor our business activities to ensure that we do not become subject to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We currently rely on exemptions from the Investment Company Act for companies that are primarily engaged in the business of certain types of financings or of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. Because of changes in the nature and number of companies that rely on the exemption for real estate, as well as given that most of the guidance surrounding this exemption comes from \u201cno action\u201d letters issued by the SEC staff, the SEC on August 31, 2011 issued a concept release requesting comment directed to the scope and use of this exemption. We do not know what action, if any, the SEC may take in response to the\ncomments that it received. If we were to become regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, either due to a change in the SEC\u2019s interpretation of that Act or due to a significant change in the value and composition of our assets, we would be subject to extensive regulation and restrictions. Among other restrictions, we would not be able to incur borrowings, which would limit our ability to fund certain investments. Accordingly, either we would have to restructure our assets so that we would not be subject to the Investment Company Act or we would have to materially change the way we do business. Either course of action could require that we sell substantial portions of our assets at a time when we might not otherwise want to do so, and we could incur significant losses as a result. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe value of certain investments and cash flows are dependent on the quality of the management of the underlying properties.\nInadequate property management can adversely impact the performance, cash flows and value of properties held by funds in which we have invested or that secure our bond investments.\nOur accounting policies and methods require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of our accounting methods involve substantial use of models, which are based on assumptions, including assumptions about future events. Our management must exercise judgment in applying many of these accounting policies and methods so that these policies and methods comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the appropriate accounting policy or method from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances but might affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that we report. See Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for a description of our significant accounting policies.\nFurther, we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. These policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner.\nBecause of the uncertainty surrounding management\u2019s judgments, assumptions and estimates pertaining to these matters, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements.\nRisks Associated with Our Relationship with Our External Manager\nWe no longer have any employees and we are therefore dependent upon the External Manager to provide all of the services we need, including finding suitable investments, conducting our operations and maintaining regulatory compliance.\nBecause we have no employees, we are dependent on the External Manager to find and close suitable investments on our behalf and to conduct all of our operations. Although our former employees became employees of the External Manager, the External Manager is not obligated to require these, or any other, employees to devote their time exclusively to us. As a result, the employees may not devote sufficient time to the management of our business operations, and in particular to sourcing and placing investments with us. Further, the Management Agreement does not require the External Manager to dedicate specific personnel to our operations and none of our former employees\u2019 continued service is guaranteed. If these individuals leave the External Manager or an affiliate thereof or are reallocated to other activities of the External Manager or its affiliates, the External Manager may be unable to replace them with persons with appropriate experience, or at all, and we may not be able to execute our business plan or maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nVarious termination provisions in the Management Agreement, including termination by us without cause, require us to pay the External Manager a substantial termination fee, which could deter termination or adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe initial term of our Management Agreement extends to December 31, 2022 and, unless terminated, the Management\nAgreement automatically renews thereafter for successive two-year terms. Either party may elect not to renew the Management Agreement effective upon the expiration of the initial term or any automatic renewal term, both upon 12 months\u2019 prior written notice. However, if we elect not to renew the Management Agreement on this basis, we are required to pay the External Manager a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee and incentive compensation earned by, plus one times the average annual amount of certain reimbursements received by, the External Manager during the 24-month period immediately preceding the effective date of termination, which could cause the termination fee to be substantial. These provisions may make it costly and difficult for us not to renew the Management Agreement. If we are required to pay the termination fee as a result of a termination, our results of operations and our shareholders\u2019 equity will be adversely affected.\nIf we terminate the Management Agreement without cause, we cannot hire the External Manager\u2019s employees, including our former employees, which could make it difficult for us to conduct our operations following any such termination.\nIf we terminate the Management Agreement without cause, we may not, for a period of two years, without the consent of the External Manager, employ any employee of the External Manager or any of its affiliates, or any person who was employed by the External Manager or any of its affiliates at any time within the two-year period immediately preceding the date we hire such person. This restriction applies to all of our former employees except that, if we have paid the termination fee described above, we may hire persons serving in the capacity of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer/President and Chief Financial Officer. The inability to hire the External Manager\u2019s employees could make it difficult for us to terminate the Management Agreement since we will need to find a new external manager or hire all new employees.\nThe fixed percentage component of the management fee payable to the External Manager is payable regardless of our performance.\nThe External Manager is entitled to receive a management fee from us that is based on a fixed percentage of our GAAP common shareholders\u2019 equity, regardless of the performance of our investment portfolio. For example, we would owe the External Manager a management fee for a specific period even if we experienced a net loss during that period. The External Manager\u2019s entitlement to a fee based on a fixed percentage of our GAAP Common Shareholders\u2019 Equity may encourage the External Manager to invest in riskier assets in order to grow the equity base upon which the fee is paid and may reduce its incentive to find investments that provide appropriate risk-adjusted returns for our investment portfolio. Similarly, the incentive compensation payable to the External Manager is based on year-over-year increases in diluted GAAP common shareholders\u2019 equity per share, which could also encourage the External Manager to invest in riskier assets.\nExternal Manager\u2019s liability is limited under the Management Agreement and we have agreed to indemnify the External Manager against certain liabilities.\nUnder the terms of the Management Agreement, the External Manager does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder in good faith and is not responsible for any action of our board of directors in following or declining to follow any advice or recommendations of the External Manager, including as set forth in the investment guidelines. Under the terms of the Management Agreement, the External Manager and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, managers, trustees, control persons, partners, stockholders and equity holders are not liable to us, our directors, stockholders or any subsidiary of ours, or their equity holders or partners for any acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the Management Agreement, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim, by the enforcement of any judgment or assessment or any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable law, or otherwise, except by reason of acts or omissions constituting bad faith, actual and intentional fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of their duties under the Management Agreement. We have agreed to indemnify the External Manager and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, managers, trustees, control persons, partners, stockholders and equity holders with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims arising from their acts or omissions not constituting bad faith, actual and intentional fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of their duties under the Management Agreement. As a result, we could experience poor performance or losses for which the External Manager would not be liable.\nAffiliates of the External Manager are engaged, or may engage, in similar businesses to ours and the External Manager may have conflicts of interest which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our shareholders.\nWe are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with Hunt, including the External Manager and its affiliates. The External Manager may be presented with investment opportunities that we would find attractive, but which it offers instead to its affiliates, some of which are engaged in businesses similar to ours. There is no guarantee that the policies and procedures adopted by us, the terms and conditions of the Management Agreement or the policies and procedures adopted by the External Manager, will enable us to identify, adequately address or mitigate all potential conflicts of interest. These factors could adversely impact our ability to make investments with attractive risk adjusted returns.\nA breach of the security of our External Manager\u2019s systems or those of other third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could damage or disrupt our business or result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential information, which could damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nOur business is reliant upon the security and efficacy of our External Manager\u2019s information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) environment, as well as those of other third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties, particularly our External Manager.\nOur ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to our External Manager\u2019s IT systems or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than if those systems were our own. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as needed and some data might not have been backed up.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely, particularly our External Manager, may be subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, phishing attacks, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks. Our External Manager may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to protect the integrity of systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely, particularly our External Manager, may not be able to anticipate all security attacks or to implement appropriate preventative measures against such security breaches. Any such security breach or unauthorized access could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of assets or harm our reputation. In addition, any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Shares\nOur Rights Plan could depress our share price.\nUnder the Rights Plan, the acquisition by an investor (or group of related investors) of greater than a 4.9% stake in the Company, could result in all existing shareholders other than the new 4.9% holder having the right to acquire new shares for a nominal cost, thereby significantly diluting the ownership interest of the acquiring person. By discouraging acquisitions of greater than a 4.9% stake in the Company, the Rights Plan might limit takeover opportunities and, as a result, could depress our share price. At December 31, 2018, we had three shareholders, including one of our executive officers, Michael L. Falcone, that held greater than a 4.9% stake in the Company. The Board of Directors named Mr. Falcone an exempt person in accordance with the Rights Plan. The Board determined that Mr. Falcone\u2019s exercise of his options and the required share purchases did not constitute a triggering event for purposes of our Rights Plan. In accordance with the Master Transaction Agreement dated January 8, 2018, Hunt remains an exempt person for purposes of the Rights Plan and may purchase up to 9.9% of the Company\u2019s shares in any rolling 12-month period, without causing a triggering event.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation may discourage attempts to acquire us.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains at least three groups of provisions that could have the effect of discouraging people from trying to acquire control of us. Those provisions are:\n\u00b7\nIf any person or group acquires 10% or more of our shares, that person or group cannot, with a very limited exception (i) engage in a business combination with us (including an acquisition from us of more than 10% of our assets or more than 5% of our shares) within five years after the person or group acquires the 10% or greater interest, unless our Board approved the business combination or acquisition of a 10% or greater interest in us before it took place, or the business combination is approved by two-thirds of the members of our Board and holders of two-thirds of the shares that are not owned by the person or group that owns the 10% or greater interest or (ii) engage in a business combination with us until more than five years after the person or group acquires the 10% or greater interest, unless the business combination is recommended by our Board and approved by holders of 80% of our shares or of two-thirds of the shares that are not owned by the person or group that owns the 10% or greater interest.\n\u00b7\nIf any person or group makes an acquisition of our shares that causes the person or group to be able to exercise one-fifth or more but less than one-third of all voting power of our shares, one-third or more but less than a majority of all voting power of our shares, or a majority or more of all voting power of our shares, the acquired shares will lose their voting power, except to the extent approved at a meeting by the vote of two-thirds of the shares not owned by the person or group, and we will have the right to redeem, for their fair market value, any of the acquired shares for which the shareholders do not approve voting rights.\n\u00b7\nSince one-third of our directors are elected each year to three-year terms this could delay the time when someone who acquires voting control of us could elect a majority of our directors.\nThe above provisions could deprive our shareholders of acquisition opportunities that might be attractive to many of them.\nOur shares are thinly traded and, as a result, the price at which they trade may not reflect their full intrinsic value.\nAlthough we are traded on Nasdaq Capital Market, our shares are thinly traded and we do not have analysts actively tracking and publishing opinions on the Company and our stock. Additionally, when we have repurchased our shares, the number of shares outstanding is reduced, which has the effect over time of further decreasing the trading volume of our shares. Accordingly, the trading price of our shares may not reflect their full intrinsic value.", "PERMNO": 83827, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "MMAC"}
