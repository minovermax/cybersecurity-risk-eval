Risk Factors\nThe foregoing discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this Report, have affected, or may in the future affect, our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations in a material and adverse manner.\nCOVID-19 RISK FACTORS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economies. Although infection rates have recently improved in many areas of the United States, the extent of the impact of the pandemic continues to be highly uncertain. Accordingly, it is possible that the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, and many states and municipalities declared public health emergencies. Since the time of these initial declarations, international, federal, state, and local public health and governmental authorities have taken extraordinary and wide-ranging measures to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, and mandates and recommendations for individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. Some of these measures have now been lifted or modified, but others have been extended or remain in place.\nTo date, we have not been materially affected by governmental orders requiring businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. Throughout the pandemic, we have been able to continue to operate as an essential business in virtually all of the markets we serve. If, however, the pandemic worsens, whether as a result of the emergence of new virus strains or additional waves of infection, it is possible that new restrictions would be adopted that could limit or restrict the scope of our operations. In general, either a worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic or the implementation of new governmental measures designed to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects could have a negative impact on several areas affecting our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could result in adverse macroeconomic conditions affecting demand for our products in the principal markets in which we operate.\n\u2022\nThe pandemic may have an adverse effect on state and local government revenues and construction budgets, and could result in delays, cancellations or curtailment of construction projects.\n\u2022\nThe pandemic could result in delays in collecting on certain of our accounts receivable from certain of our customers.\n\u2022\nThe pandemic could result in increased costs associated with compliance with new healt and safety measures, which may affect our operations in one or more of the markets in which we operate.\n\u2022\nThe pandemic has resulted, and may continue to result, in fluctuations in equity market prices (including that of our Common Stock), interest rates and credit spreads, which may limit our ability to raise or deploy capital and implement our future plans.\n\u2022\nFinally, the pandemic could have other negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, which we may not be able to anticipate or respond to effectively.\nThe future course of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to predict. Although significant progress has been made in the current vaccination campaign in the United States, new virus strains have emerged, some which may present different health risks or be as or more difficult to contain than the original strains that reached the United States in early 2020. We are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its likely effects. The timing of these effects is not expected to be uniform, with some effects having a short-term impact and others likely to be felt for a number of years. In general, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately impact our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous factors, which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe duration and scope of the outbreak;\n\u2022\nthe timing of, and progress made in the current vaccination campaign, including the effectiveness of the campaign in dealing with new virus strains;\n\u2022\ngovernmental, business and individual actions that have been and may be taken in response to the outbreak;\n\u2022\nthe effect of the outbreak on our customers, suppliers, supply chain, and other business partners;\n\u2022\nour ability during the outbreak to continue to carry out our manufacturing operations in an efficient manner, while taking measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees;\n\u2022\nthe willingness and ability of our customers to order and pay for our products during and following the outbreak; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of the outbreak on the financial markets and economic activity generally.\nThe above uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic also make it more challenging for our management to estimate the future performance of our business and develop strategies to generate growth or achieve our objectives for fiscal 2022 and future periods.\nOne key area we continue to closely monitor is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our manufacturing operations. Although we are taking precautions to ensure the safety of our employees, we have experienced outbreaks at some of our facilities. In the event we suffer a serious outbreak at one of our manufacturing facilities, we may be forced to suspend operations at such facility until the health conditions improve. Any such reduction in our production capacity could render us unable to continue to produce our construction products or satisfy order placed by our customers.\nINDUSTRY RISK FACTORS\nWe are affected by the level of demand in the construction industry.\nDemand for our construction products and building materials is directly related to the level of activity in the construction industry, which includes residential, commercial and infrastructure construction. While the most recent downturn in residential and commercial construction, which began in calendar 2007, materially affected our business, certain economic fundamentals began improving in calendar 2012, and have generally continued to improve, particularly in recent periods; however, the rate and sustainability of such improvement remains uncertain, and the total impact of COVID-19 is not yet known. Although recent\nproposals have been made to increase infrastructure spending by the federal and some state and local governments, infrastructure spending continues to be adversely affected by several factors, including the budget constraints currently being experienced by federal, state and local governments. Any decrease in the amount of government funds available for such projects or any decrease in construction activity in general (including any weakness in residential or commercial construction) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, and this causes our quarterly results to vary significantly.\nA majority of our business is seasonal with peak revenue and profits occurring primarily in the months of April through November when the weather in our markets is more suitable for construction activity. Quarterly results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future. Such variations could have a negative impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to the risk of unfavorable weather conditions, particularly during peak construction periods, as well as other unexpected operational difficulties.\nUnfavorable weather conditions, such as snow, cold weather, tornados, hurricanes, tropical storms, and heavy or sustained rainfall, can reduce construction activity and adversely affect demand for construction products. In addition, severe weather conditions can impair our ability to continue our operations, and even require the closure of certain of our facilities on a temporary or extended basis. Weather conditions also have the potential to increase our costs (including the cost of natural gas and electric power), reduce our production, or impede our ability to transport our products in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Similarly, operational difficulties, such as business interruption due to required maintenance, capital improvement projects, or loss of power, can increase our costs and reduce our production. The effect of these risks is more pronounced during peak construction periods, such as months of April through November, during which any reduction in demand or production could adversely affect our sales and operating profits.\nWe and our customers participate in cyclical industries and regional markets, which are subject to industry downturns.\nA majority of our revenue is from customers who are in industries and businesses that are cyclical in nature and subject to changes in general economic conditions. For example, many of our customers operate in the construction industry, which is affected by a variety of factors, such as general economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, levels of infrastructure spending, and other factors beyond our control. In addition, since our operations are in a variety of geographic markets, our businesses are subject to differing economic conditions in each such geographic market. Economic downturns in the industries to which we sell our products or localized downturns in the regions where we have operations generally have an adverse effect on demand for our products and negatively affect the collectability of our receivables. In general, any downturns in these industries or regions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMany of our products are commodities, which are subject to significant changes in supply and demand and price fluctuations.\nMany of the products sold by us are commodities, and competition among manufacturers is based largely on price. Prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand, general economic conditions, and other market conditions beyond our control. Increases in the production capacity of industry participants for products such as gypsum wallboard, or cement or increases in cement imports tend to create an oversupply of such products leading to an imbalance between supply and demand, which can have a negative impact on product prices. Currently, there\ncontinues to be significant excess nameplate capacity in the gypsum wallboard industry in the United States. There can be no assurance that prices for products sold by us will not decline in the future or that such declines will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND LEGAL RISK FACTORS\nOur and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including environmental laws, which can be costly and burdensome.\nOur operations and those of our customers are subject to and affected by federal, state, and local laws and regulations with respect to such matters as land usage, street and highway usage, noise level, and health and safety and environmental matters. In many instances, various certificates, permits, or licenses are required in order for us or our customers to conduct business or carry out construction and related operations. For example, certain of our waste-burning cement kilns are subject to the Standards of Performance for New Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources for Commercial/Industrial Solid Waste Incinerators (the CISWI Rule). Although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with regulatory requirements or that demand for our products will not be adversely affected by regulatory issues affecting our customers. In addition, future developments, such as the discovery of new facts or conditions, the enactment or adoption of new or stricter laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us, require additional investment by us, or prevent us from opening, expanding, or modifying plants or facilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, out of the 16 states where we have operations, 10 states contain at least one \u201carea\u201d that was designated as being in nonattainment for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (California, Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin). We may be required to meet new control requirements in these states requiring significant capital expenditures for compliance.\nClimate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely affect our business.\nA number of governmental bodies have finalized, proposed, or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to the potential effects of climate change. Such legislation or regulation has and potentially could include provisions for a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax, among other provisions. Any future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would likely have a negative impact on our business or results of operations, whether through the imposition of raw material or production limitations, fuel-use, or carbon taxes emission limitations or reductions, or otherwise. Notably, curbing GHG emissions and tackling climate change is a clear priority for President Biden\u2019s administration.\nShortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change and to require agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration, as well as a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the Biden administration has reviewed and approved the rule. These executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations.\nClimate change legislation and regulation concerning GHGs if implemented could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. There is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely affect the cost of purchased energy and electricity.\nOther potential effects of climate change include physical effects such as disruption in production and product distribution as a result of major storm events and shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities. Production and shipment levels for our businesses correlate with general construction activity, most of which occurs outdoors and, as a result, is affected by erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes, and other unusual or unexpected weather-related conditions, which can significantly affect our businesses.\nWe may become subject to significant cleanup, remediation, reclamation, and other liabilities under applicable environmental laws.\nOur operations are subject to state, federal, and local environmental laws and regulations, which impose liability for cleanup or remediation of environmental pollution and hazardous waste arising from past acts. These laws and regulations also require pollution control and prevention, site restoration, reclamation, and operating permits, and/or approvals to conduct certain of our operations or expand or modify our facilities. Certain of our operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations. We are unable to estimate accurately the impact on our business or results of operations of any such law or regulation at this time. Risk of environmental liability (including the incurrence of fines, penalties, other sanctions, or litigation liability) is inherent in the operation of our businesses. As a result, it is possible that environmental liabilities and compliance with environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future.\nOur operations are dependent on our rights and ability to mine our properties and on our having renewed or received the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nWe hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining, and other permits, water rights, and approvals authorizing operations at many of our facilities. A decision by a governmental agency or other third parties to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Expansion of our existing operations is also predicated on securing the necessary environmental or other permits, water rights, or approvals, which we may not receive in a timely manner or at all.\nTitle to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights may also be disputed. Mineral properties sometimes contain claims or transfer histories that examiners cannot verify. A successful claim that we do not have title to one or more of our properties or lack appropriate water rights could cause us to lose any rights to explore, develop, and extract any minerals or utilize water on that property, without compensation for our prior expenditures relating to such property. Our business may suffer a material adverse effect in the event one or more of our properties are determined to have title deficiencies.\nIn some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. A third party could take action to suspend the access or easement, and any such action could be materially adverse to our results of operations or financial conditions.\nWe may incur significant costs in connection with pending and future litigation.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including but not limited to personal injury, environmental, antitrust, tax, asbestos, property entitlements and land use, intellectual property, commercial, contract, product liability, health and safety, and employment matters. The outcome of pending or future lawsuits, claims, investigations, or proceedings is often difficult to predict and could be adverse and material in amount. Developments in these proceedings can lead to\nchanges in management\u2019s estimates of liabilities associated with these proceedings, including as a result of rulings or judgments by a judge, agency, or arbitrator, settlements, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in a particular period. In addition, the defense of these lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings may divert our management\u2019s attention, and we may incur significant costs in defending these matters.\nOur bylaws include a forum selection clause, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any internal corporate claims within the meaning of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), (ii) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (iii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or employees to us or to our stockholders, or (iv) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, will be a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This forum selection provision in our bylaws may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to pursue claims in a judicial forum of their choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our bylaws, a court could rule in specific circumstances that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable, which could require that we defend claims in other forums.\nCYBER RISK FACTORS\nA cyber-attack or data security breach affecting our information technology systems may negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe use information technology systems to collect, store, and transmit the data needed to operate our businesses, including our confidential and proprietary information. Although we endeavor to implement and maintain industry-standard security safeguards and policies to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of such information, we cannot prevent all cyber-attacks or data security breaches. If such an attack or breach occurs, our businesses could be negatively affected, and we could incur additional costs in remediating the attack or breach and suffer reputational harm due to the theft or disclosure of our confidential information.\nFINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS\nOur Cement business is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are sensitive to changes in volume.\nDue to the high levels of fixed capital required to produce cement, the ability of our Cement segment to remain profitable is dependent on achieving and maintaining strong volumes of cement production and sales. Any decreases in volume could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our cement plants require significant capital expenditures to support our business. We believe that our current cash balance, along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will provide sufficient cash to support our currently anticipated operating and capital needs. However, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to purchase and maintain the property and machinery necessary to operate our cement business, we may be required to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or incur additional debt.\nAny material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAny material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows. Our contracts with our customers provide for different potential remedies in the event a customer fails to purchase the minimum contracted amount of product in a given period. If we were to pursue legal remedies against a customer that failed to purchase the minimum contracted amount of product under a fixed-volume contract or failed to satisfy the take-or-pay commitment under a take-or-pay contract, we may receive significantly less in a judgment or settlement of any claimed breach than we would have received had the customer fully performed under the contract. In the event of any customer\u2019s breach, we may also choose to renegotiate any disputed contract on less favorable terms (including with respect to price and volume) in order to allow for us to preserve the relationship with that customer.\nVolatility and disruption of financial markets could affect access to credit.\nDifficult economic conditions can cause a contraction in the availability, and increase the cost, of credit in the marketplace. A number of our customers or suppliers have been and may continue to be adversely affected by unsettled conditions in capital and credit markets, which in some cases have made it more difficult or costly for them to finance their business operations. These unsettled conditions have the potential to reduce the sources of liquidity for the Company and our customers.\nOur results of operations are subject to significant changes in the cost and availability of fuel, energy and other raw materials.\nMajor cost components in each of our businesses are the costs of fuel, energy, and raw materials. Significant increases in the costs of fuel, energy, or raw materials, or substantial decreases in their availability, could materially and adversely affect our sales and operating profits. Prices for fuel, energy, or raw materials used in connection with our businesses have in some cases been subject to significant changes in a short period of time for reasons outside our control. For example, prices for fuel and electrical power, which are significant components of the costs associated with our Gypsum Wallboard and Cement businesses, have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may increase in the future. The prices we pay for fuel and electric power are often determined in whole or in part by market-based pricing mechanisms (including spot market pricing mechanisms). In the past, we have experienced significant and unanticipated price increases due to, among other things, unfavorable weather conditions and governmental responses from the resulting shortages in fuel and power. Significant price fluctuations also have the potential to give rise to disputes with contractual counterparties, which can be complex and difficult to resolve. In the event of large or rapid increases in prices, we may not be able to pass the increases through to our customers in full, which would reduce our operating margin\nChanges in the cost or availability of raw materials supplied by third parties may adversely affect our operating and financial performance.\nWe generally maintain our own reserves of limestone, gypsum, aggregates, and other materials that we use to manufacture our products. However, we obtain certain raw materials used to manufacture our products, such as synthetic gypsum and slag granules, from third parties who produce such materials as by-products of industrial processes. While we try to secure our needed supply of such materials through long-term contracts, those contracts may not be sufficient to meet our needs, or we may be unable to renew or replace existing contracts when they expire or are terminated in the future. Should our existing suppliers cease operations or reduce or eliminate production of these by-products, our costs to procure\nthese materials may increase significantly, or we may be obliged to procure alternatives to replace these materials, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any such developments may adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur production facilities may experience unexpected equipment failures, catastrophic events, and scheduled maintenance.\nOur manufacturing processes are complex and dependent upon critical pieces of equipment and effective maintenance programs. Such equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, violent weather conditions, or unexpected operational difficulties. We also have periodically scheduled shut-downs to perform maintenance on our facilities. Any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue and profits due to lost production time, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In general, any interruptions in our production processes or limitation in our production capabilities may cause our productivity and results of operations to decline significantly during the affected period.\nSignificant changes in the cost and availability of transportation could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSome of the raw materials used in our manufacturing processes, such as coal or coke, are transported to our facilities by truck or rail. In addition, transportation logistics play an important part in allowing us to supply products to our customers, whether by truck, rail, or barge. For example, we deliver gypsum wallboard to many areas of the United States, and the transportation costs associated with the delivery of our wallboard products represent a significant portion of the variable cost of our Gypsum Wallboard segment. On the other hand, cement is more difficult and costly to transport over long distances, which limits the areas typically served by our cement plants. Significant increases in the cost of fuel or energy can result in material increases in the cost of transportation, which could materially and adversely affect our operating profits. In addition, reductions in the availability of certain modes of transportation, such as rail or trucking, could limit our ability to deliver product and therefore materially and adversely affect our operating profits.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictive covenants and require us to meet certain financial ratios and tests, which limit our flexibility and could give rise to a default if we are unable to remain in compliance.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility, Senior Unsecured Notes, and Term Loan contain, among other things, covenants that limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities, including but not limited to our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nsell assets or make other fundamental changes;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers and acquisitions;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans, advances or guarantees;\n\u2022\nencumber our assets or those of our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, these agreements require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. Events beyond our control, including changes in general business and economic conditions, may impair our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests. A breach of\nany of these covenants or failure to maintain the required ratios and meet the required tests may result in an event of default under these agreements. This may allow the lenders under these agreements to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, terminate any commitments to extend further credit to us, and pursue other remedies available to them under the applicable agreements. If this occurs, our indebtedness may be accelerated, and we may not be able to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, or repay the accelerated indebtedness. In general, the occurrence of any event of default under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have incurred or may incur substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and reduce our profitability.\nIn the past, we have incurred significant indebtedness in connection with acquisition transactions or otherwise to fund the growth and development of our business. We may also incur significant indebtedness from time to time in the future for these or other reasons. Our future ability to satisfy our debt obligations is subject, to some extent, to financial, market, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. Substantial debt obligations could have negative consequences to our business, and, in particular, could impede, restrict, or delay the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. For example:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts, capital expenditures, or strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our substantial debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs. If this occurs, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, selling equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022\nas a result of the amount of our outstanding indebtedness and the restrictive covenants to which we are or may become subject, if we determine that we require additional financing to fund future working capital, capital investments, or other business activities, we may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; and\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nIncreases in interest rates and inflation could adversely affect our business and demand for our products, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is significantly affected by the movement of interest rates. Interest rates have a direct impact on the level of residential, commercial, and infrastructure construction activity by impacting the cost of borrowed funds to builders. Higher interest rates could result in decreased demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, increases in interest rates could result in higher interest expense related to borrowings under our borrowing facilities. Inflation can result in higher interest rates. With inflation, the costs of capital increase, and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline. Current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation, which could have a direct and indirect adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIncreases in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations.\nA number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate, including:\n\u2022\ngovernmental authorities increasing taxes or eliminating deductions, particularly the depletion deduction;\n\u2022\nthe mix of earnings from depletable versus non-depletable businesses;\n\u2022\nthe jurisdictions in which earnings are taxed;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022\nchanges in available tax credits;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\nother changes in tax laws; and\n\u2022\nthe interpretation of tax laws and/or administrative practices.\nAny significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings and free cash flow for future periods.\nDisruption of our business operations due to disputes with organized labor.\nApproximately half of our hourly employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Disputes with trade unions or the inability to renew our labor agreements may lead to work stoppages or strikes that could disrupt our business operations and lead to higher costs and/or reduced revenue and operating earnings.\nOTHER RISK FACTORS\nWe may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions that are intended to complement or expand our businesses. We may not be able to complete proposed transactions, and even if completed, the transactions may involve a number of risks that may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nAs business conditions warrant and our financial resources permit, we may pursue opportunities to acquire businesses or technologies and to form joint ventures that we believe could complement, enhance, or expand our current businesses or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty identifying appropriate opportunities, or if we do identify opportunities, we may not be successful in completing transactions for a number of reasons. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve one or more of a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing businesses to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired business or joint venture;\n\u2022\npossible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process;\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired business or joint venture to achieve expected operational, profitability, and investment return objectives;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, asset devaluation, or restructuring charges;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unanticipated liabilities and costs for which indemnification is unavailable or inadequate;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties encountered in operating in new geographic areas; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to achieve other intended objectives of the transaction.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain, and manage our newly acquired operations or their employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies, which may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nOur Cement business has grown largely through acquisitions, and there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire cement plans to support future growth.\nIn prior years, we have been able to increase the size and scope of our Cement business in large part through acquisitions of cement plants from third parties. There are a limited number of companies operating cement plant in the United States, and plants typically become available for purchase only infrequently, such as in connection with a merger, acquisition or corporate reorganization or refinancing. When cement plants become available for purchase, the purchase process is often highly competitive, which tends to result in relatively high valuations for the plants offered for sale. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or acquire cement plants at values that we regard as reasonable.\nWe may pursue new business opportunities and, if we do so, these opportunities will be subject to the risks typically associated with the early stages of business development or product line expansion.\nWe may from time to time pursue opportunities which are natural extensions of our existing core businesses and which allow us to leverage our core competencies, existing infrastructure, and customer relationships. Our likelihood of success in pursuing and realizing these opportunities must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the early phases of business development or product line expansion, including the difficulties involved in obtaining permits; planning and constructing new facilities; transporting and storing products; establishing, maintaining, or expanding customer relationships; as well as navigating the regulatory environment in which we operate. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in the pursuit and realization of these opportunities.\nThis report includes various forward-looking statements, which are not facts or guarantees of future performance and which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.\nThis report and other materials we have filed or will file with the SEC, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us contain or may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate to matters of a strictly factual or historical nature and generally discuss or relate to forecasts, estimates, or other expectations regarding future events. Generally, the words \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccan,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, including statements related to expected operating and performing results, planned transactions, plans, and objectives of management, future developments, or conditions in the industries in which we participate, including future prices for our products, audits, and legal proceedings to which we are a party, and other trends, developments, and uncertainties that may affect our business in the future.\nForward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance but instead represent only our beliefs at the time the statements were made regarding future events, which are subject to significant risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are outside of our control. Any or all of the forward-looking statements made by us may turn out to be materially inaccurate. This can\noccur as a result of incorrect assumptions, changes in facts and circumstances, or the effects of known risks and uncertainties. Many of the risks and uncertainties mentioned in this report or other reports filed by us with the SEC, including those discussed in the risk factor section of this report, will be important in determining whether these forward-looking statements prove to be accurate. Consequently, neither our stockholders nor any other person should place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements and should recognize that actual results may differ materially from those that may be anticipated by us.\nAll forward-looking statements made in this report are made as of the date hereof, and the risk that actual results will differ materially from expectations expressed in this report will increase with the passage of time. We undertake no obligation, and disclaim any duty, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in our expectations, or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 89983, "SIC": 3270, "TIC": "EXP"}
