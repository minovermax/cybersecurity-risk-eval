RISK FACTORS\nThe following \u201crisk factors\u201d could materially and adversely affect Valvoline\u2019s business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be considered when reading the rest of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These factors could cause future results to differ from those in forward-looking statements and from historical trends.\nRisks related to the industries in which Valvoline operates\nBecause of the concentration of Valvoline\u2019s sales to a small number of retailers, the loss of one or more, or a significant reduction in orders from, its top retail customers could adversely affect its financial results, as could the loss of one of its distributor relationships.\nValvoline\u2019s Core North America segment\u2019s sales represented approximately 40% of Valvoline\u2019s total sales in fiscal 2020. Five key retailers together accounted for 49% of Core North America\u2019s fiscal 2020 sales and 45% of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade accounts receivable as of September 30, 2020. One of these key retailers accounted for greater than 19% of Core North America\u2019s fiscal 2020 sales. Valvoline\u2019s volume of sales to these customers fluctuates and can be influenced by many factors, including product pricing, competition for shelf space, purchasing patterns and promotional activities. For example, Valvoline\u2019s retail customers have increasingly shifted shelf distribution towards private label lubricant products, which has negatively impacted Core North America\u2019s retail channel DIY branded lubricant sales. Additionally, many of Valvoline\u2019s retail customers have changed their promotional strategies, increasing the frequency and number of brands promoted at any given time, including private label, which has further negatively impacted branded lubricant sales within the retail channel. In response to these market dynamics, Valvoline has strengthened its consumer messaging, optimized pricing in relation to these promotional strategies and focused its efforts on increasing synthetic lubricant sales; however, if those strategies are not effective, or if Valvoline is unable to adapt to changing market dynamics, Valvoline\u2019s results of operations could be negatively affected. The loss of, or significant reduction in orders from, one of Valvoline\u2019s top five retail customers or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, as could customer disputes regarding shipments, fees, merchandise condition or related matters. Valvoline\u2019s inability to collect accounts receivable from one of its major customers, or a significant deterioration in the financial condition of one of these customers, including a bankruptcy filing or a liquidation, could also have a material adverse effect on Valvoline\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nValvoline also relies on independent distributors to sell and deliver its products. The consolidation of distributors, loss of a relationship with a distributor, significant disagreement with a distributor, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of a distributor could also have a material adverse effect on Valvoline\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nValvoline faces significant competition from other companies, which places downward pressure on prices and margins and may adversely affect Valvoline\u2019s business and results of operations.\nValvoline operates in highly competitive markets, competing against a number of domestic and international companies. Competition is based on several key criteria, including brand recognition, product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, ability to develop products in cooperation with customers and customer service, as well as the ability to bring innovative products or services to the marketplace. Certain key competitors, including Shell/Pennzoil, BP/Castrol and Exxon/Mobil, are significantly larger than Valvoline and have greater financial resources and more diverse portfolios of products and services, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand adverse changes in conditions within the relevant industry, retail market dynamics, the prices of raw materials and energy or general economic conditions. In addition, competitors\u2019 pricing decisions could compel Valvoline to decrease its prices, which could negatively affect Valvoline\u2019s margins and profitability. Valvoline continues to see increasing competition from private label competitors, which has negatively impacted branded lubricant sales in the retail channel as price gaps between private label and branded products has grown. Further competition from private label competitors, including the entry of new private label competitors, or additional competition in markets served by Valvoline, could adversely affect margins and profitability and could lead to a reduction in market share. Also, Valvoline competes in certain markets that are relatively flat to declining, such as the U.S. passenger car motor oil\nmarket. If Valvoline\u2019s strategies for dealing with these markets and leveraging market opportunities are not successful, its results of operations could be negatively affected.\nRising and volatile raw material costs and supply-chain constraints or disruptions could adversely affect Valvoline\u2019s results of operations.\nRising and volatile raw material prices, especially for base oil and lubricant additives, have in the past and may in the future, negatively impact Valvoline\u2019s costs, results of operations and the valuation of its inventory. Valvoline may not always be able to raise prices in response to increased costs of raw materials or may experience a lag in passing through such cost increases, as the ability to pass on the costs of such price increases is largely dependent upon market conditions. Likewise, reductions in the valuation of Valvoline\u2019s inventory due to market volatility may not be recovered and could result in losses.\nValvoline purchases certain products and raw materials from suppliers, often pursuant to written supply contracts. If those suppliers are unable to meet Valvoline\u2019s orders in a timely manner or choose to terminate or otherwise avoid contractual arrangements, Valvoline may not be able to make alternative supply arrangements or may face increased costs from alternative suppliers. For base oils, Valvoline\u2019s suppliers are primarily large oil producers, many of whom operate oil lubricant production and sales businesses as part of their enterprise. There are risks inherent in obtaining important raw materials from actual or potential competitors, including the risk that applicable antitrust laws may be inadequate to mitigate Valvoline\u2019s exposure to these risks. Valvoline purchases substantially all of its lubricant additives from four key suppliers. Because the industry is characterized by a limited number of lubricant additives suppliers, there are a limited number of alternative suppliers with whom Valvoline could transact in the event of a disruption to its existing supply relationships; for example, due to disruptions to its suppliers' operations caused by natural disasters, severe weather conditions, climate change or significant changes in trade regulations. The inability of Valvoline\u2019s suppliers to meet its supply demands could also have a material adverse effect on its business.\nAlso, domestic and global government regulations related to the manufacture or transport of certain raw materials may impede Valvoline\u2019s ability to obtain those raw materials on commercially reasonable terms. If Valvoline is unable to obtain and retain qualified suppliers under commercially acceptable terms, its ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely, competitive and profitable manner or grow its business successfully could be adversely affected.\nDemand for Valvoline\u2019s products and services could be adversely affected by consumer spending trends, declining economic conditions, industry trends and a number of other factors, all of which are beyond its control.\nDemand for Valvoline\u2019s products and services may be affected by a number of factors it cannot control, including the number and age of vehicles in current service, regulation and legislation, technological advances in the automotive industry and changes in engine technology, including the adoption rate of electric or other alternative engine technologies, changing automotive OEM specifications and longer recommended intervals between oil changes. In addition, during periods of declining economic conditions, consumers may defer vehicle maintenance. Similarly, increases in energy prices or other factors may cause miles driven to decline, resulting in less vehicle wear and tear and lower demand for maintenance, which may lead to consumers deferring purchases of Valvoline\u2019s products and services. All of these factors, which impact metrics such as drain intervals and oil changes per day, could result in a decline in the demand for Valvoline\u2019s products and services and adversely affect its sales, cash flows and overall financial condition.\nFailure to develop and market new products, services and production technologies could impact Valvoline\u2019s competitive position and have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nThe lubricants industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements. To maintain margins and remain competitive, Valvoline must successfully innovate and introduce new products, improvements or services that appeal to its customers and ultimately to global consumers. Changes in additive technologies, base oil production techniques and sources, and the demand for improved performance by OEMs and consumers place particular pressure on Valvoline to continue to improve its product offerings. In addition, the adoption of electric vehicles is increasing and is expected to increase at a faster pace in future years as certain states and international governments implement limits on the sale of vehicles with internal combustion engines, which reduces demand for lubricants, but expands the opportunity for other products and services required by electric vehicles, including\ncoolants, fluids and greases. If Valvoline is unable to develop and market products and services for electric vehicles, its business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Further, Valvoline\u2019s efforts to respond to changes in consumer demand in a timely and cost-efficient manner to drive growth could be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development and service innovation, including the inability to identify viable new products, successfully complete research and development, obtain regulatory approvals, obtain intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products or service techniques. Due to the lengthy development process, technological challenges and intense competition, there can be no assurance that any of the products or services Valvoline is currently developing, or could develop in the future, will achieve substantial commercial success. The time and expense invested in product development may not result in commercial products or provide revenues. Valvoline could be required to write-off its investments related to a new product that does not reach commercial viability. Moreover, Valvoline may experience operating losses after new products are introduced and commercialized because of high start-up costs, unexpected manufacturing costs or problems, or lack of demand.\nDamage to Valvoline\u2019s brand and reputation could have an adverse effect on its business.\nMaintaining Valvoline\u2019s strong reputation with both consumers and customers is a key component of its business. Product liability claims, false advertising claims, product or service complaints or recalls, its inability to ship, sell or transport affected products and governmental investigations could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and affect consumer or customer confidence in Valvoline's products and services, which may materially and adversely affect its business operations, decrease sales and increase costs.\nValvoline manufactures and markets a variety of products, such as automotive and industrial lubricants and automotive coolants and chemicals, and provides automotive maintenance services. If allegations are made that some of Valvoline\u2019s products have failed to perform up to consumers\u2019 or customers\u2019 expectations or have caused damage or injury to individuals or property, or that Valvoline\u2019s services were not provided in a manner consistent with its vision and values, the public may develop a negative perception of Valvoline and its brands. In addition, if Valvoline\u2019s franchisees, Express Care and joint venture operators experience service failures or do not successfully operate their quick lube service centers in a manner consistent with Valvoline\u2019s standards, its brand, image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could negatively impact its business and operating results. In addition, if any party with whom Valvoline has a sponsorship relationship were to generate negative publicity, Valvoline's brand image could be harmed. A negative public perception of Valvoline\u2019s brands, whether justified or not, could impair its reputation, involve it in litigation, damage its brand equity and have a material adverse effect on its business. In addition, damage to the reputation of Valvoline\u2019s competitors or others in its industry could negatively impact Valvoline\u2019s reputation and business.\nRisks related to executing Valvoline\u2019s strategy\nValvoline has set aggressive growth goals for its business, including increasing sales, cash flow, market share, margins and number of Quick Lubes stores, to achieve its long-term strategic objectives. Execution of Valvoline\u2019s growth strategies and business plans to facilitate that growth involves a number of risks.\nValvoline has set aggressive growth goals for its business to meet its long-term strategic objectives and improve shareholder value by aggressively growing Quick Lubes organically and through acquisitions, maintaining Core North America and developing International with the goal of becoming a more service-driven business. Valvoline\u2019s failure to meet one or more of these goals or objectives could negatively impact its business and is one of the most important risks that Valvoline faces. Aspects of that risk include, among others, changes to the global economy, failure to identify acquisition targets or real estate for new stores to grow Quick Lubes, construction costs or delays limiting new store growth, failure to develop products or services for electric vehicles, changes to the competitive landscape, including those related to automotive maintenance recommendations and consumer preferences, continued private label growth, entry of new competitors, failure to grow the Valvoline brand internationally, attraction and retention of skilled employees, failure to successfully develop and implement digital platforms to support the Company\u2019s growth initiatives, the potential failure of product innovation plans, failure to comply with existing or new regulatory requirements, failure to maintain a competitive cost structure and other risks outlined in greater detail in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nValvoline may be unable to execute its growth strategy, and acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact Valvoline\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions, particularly for the Quick Lubes business segment, are an important element of Valvoline\u2019s overall growth strategy. In addition, building strategic alliances for distribution and manufacturing, particularly in international markets, including through joint venture partnerships, product distribution and toll manufacturing arrangements, are also an important element of Valvoline\u2019s overall growth strategy. Valvoline expects to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions, and to continue to grow its Quick Lubes business organically and through acquisitions. An inability to execute these plans could have a material adverse impact on Valvoline\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the anticipated benefits of Valvoline\u2019s acquisitions may not be realized and the process of integrating an acquired company, business, or product may create unforeseen operating difficulties or expenditures.\nValvoline\u2019s acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances could also result in dilutive issuances of its equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, impairment of goodwill or purchased long-lived assets and restructuring charges, any of which could harm its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe business model for Valvoline\u2019s Quick Lubes business, including its relationships with franchisees, presents a number of risks.\nThe Quick Lubes business is made up of an international network of both company-owned and franchised stores. Valvoline\u2019s success relies in part on the financial success and cooperation of its franchisees. However, Valvoline has limited influence over their operations. Valvoline\u2019s franchisees manage their businesses independently and are responsible for the day-to-day operations of approximately 60% of Quick Lube system stores as of September 30, 2020. Valvoline\u2019s royalty and other payments from franchised stores are largely dependent on franchisee sales. Valvoline\u2019s franchisees may have limited or no sales growth, and Valvoline\u2019s revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. In addition, if sales or business performance trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, store closures, delayed or reduced royalty payments to Valvoline and reduced growth in the number of Quick Lube stores.\nValvoline\u2019s success also depends on the willingness and ability of its independent franchisees to implement major initiatives, which may require additional investment by them, and remain aligned with Valvoline on operating, promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of Valvoline\u2019s franchisees to contribute to the achievement of Valvoline\u2019s overall plans is dependent in large part on the availability of funding to its franchisees at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or the creditworthiness of individual franchisees. The size of Valvoline\u2019s largest franchisees creates additional risk due to their importance to Quick Lube's growth strategy, requiring their cooperation and alignment with Valvoline\u2019s initiatives.\nValvoline is the primary supplier of products to all Quick Lube stores. The growth and performance of Valvoline\u2019s lubricants and other product lines depends in large part on the performance of its Quick Lubes business, potentially amplifying the negative effect of the other risks related to the Quick Lubes business model.\nValvoline shares in ownership of joint ventures, which may limit its ability to manage third-party risks associated with these projects.\nFor financial or strategic reasons, Valvoline conducts a portion of its business through joint ventures. Joint ventures, particularly Valvoline\u2019s existing 50/50 joint ventures with Cummins in India, China and Argentina, are an important part of its growth strategy internationally. In these joint ventures, Valvoline shares influence over the operation of the joint venture and its assets, but does not have a controlling interest or vote. Therefore, joint ventures may involve risks such as the possibility that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt, be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations, have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with Valvoline's business interests or goals, or take actions that are contrary to Valvoline's direction or to applicable laws and regulations. If Valvoline\u2019s relationship with one of its joint venture partners were to deteriorate, it could negatively impact Valvoline\u2019s ability to achieve its growth goals internationally. In addition, joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without Valvoline's consent, or Valvoline may be unable to take action without the concurrence of its joint venture partners. Consequently, actions by the joint venture, joint venture partner\nor other third-party could expose Valvoline to claims for damages, financial penalties and reputational harm, any of which could have an adverse effect on its business and operations. Although joint ventures may generate positive cash flow, in some cases they may be unable or unwilling to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners.\nRisks related to operating Valvoline's business\nValvoline\u2019s significant global operations subject it to risks, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSales from the International business segment accounted for 22% of Valvoline\u2019s sales for fiscal 2020 and Valvoline expects sales from international markets to grow in the future. Also, Valvoline has multiple manufacturing locations outside of the United States, which will increase as Valvoline's new blending and packaging plant in China begins production, expected in fiscal 2021. Accordingly, its business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions.\nThe global nature of Valvoline\u2019s business presents difficulties in hiring and maintaining a workforce in certain countries. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided in other countries. In addition, other countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax Valvoline\u2019s income, or adopt other restrictions on trade or investment, including currency exchange controls. The imposition of new or additional tariffs or other significant changes in trade regulations are also risks that could impair Valvoline\u2019s financial performance. If Valvoline is subject to new or additional tariffs, operating costs could increase and Valvoline may not be able to recapture those costs.\nCertain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with Valvoline\u2019s global scope. For example, it may be more difficult for Valvoline to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through other legal systems. There is a risk that non-U.S. governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where Valvoline operates. Social and cultural standards in certain countries may not support compliance with Valvoline\u2019s corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and regulations. Also, changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where Valvoline operates are a risk to Valvoline\u2019s financial performance and future growth. As Valvoline continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to Valvoline\u2019s global operations will not have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdverse developments in the global economy or in regional economies and potential disruptions of financial markets could negatively impact Valvoline\u2019s customers and suppliers, and therefore have a negative impact on its results of operations.\nA global or regional economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit Valvoline\u2019s ability to produce and sell products. Valvoline\u2019s business and operating results are sensitive to global and regional economic downturns, credit market tightness, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, changes in interest rates, sovereign debt defaults and other challenges, including those related to international sanctions and acts of aggression or threatened aggression that can affect the global economy. With 78% of Valvoline\u2019s sales coming from North America in fiscal 2020, Valvoline is particularly sensitive to the risk of an economic slowdown or downturn in that region. In the event of adverse developments or stagnation in the economy or financial markets, Valvoline\u2019s customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, reduced demand for their products, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers might delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to Valvoline in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers may experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to Valvoline. A weakening or reversal of the global economy or a substantial part of it could negatively impact Valvoline\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to grow.\nPandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as the novel coronavirus, may disrupt Valvoline\u2019s business and operations, which could materially affect Valvoline\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and forward-looking expectations.\nDisruptions caused by pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, in the United States or globally, could materially affect Valvoline's results of operations, financial condition and forward-looking expectations. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted Valvoline's business and results of operations during\nfiscal 2020 and adverse impacts are expected to continue in future periods, which Valvoline is unable to reasonably predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic.\nSpecifically, COVID-19 lockdowns and stay-at-home guidelines significantly impacted miles driven in most of Valvoline\u2019s key markets in fiscal 2020 resulting in lower lubricant volumes across Valvoline's reportable segments. In addition, Valvoline may voluntarily elect or be required to temporarily close or reduce operations at its Quick Lubes' service center stores, lubricant blending and packaging plants or remove its employees and personnel from the field for their protection. COVID-19 has also had a negative impact on Valvoline\u2019s franchisees. Certain franchises reduced hours or temporarily closed at the discretion of the respective independent operator. The failure of one or more franchisees would have an adverse impact on Valvoline\u2019s business due to their impact on Valvoline's growth, financial and operating performance.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company restricted all non-essential travel and implemented work-from-home protocols for employees in virtually all locations globally, other than those in Valvoline's retail service center stores, production and distribution facilities, and those restrictions have largely continued into fiscal 2021. The suspension of travel and doing business in-person could negatively impact the Company's marketing efforts, challenge the ability to enter into customer contracts in a timely manner, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm Valvoline's business. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Valvoline also has seen an increase in attempts to breach its information technology systems with the implementation of work-from-home protocols, including cyber-security threats such as phishing, spam emails, hacking, social engineering, and malicious software, increasing the risks associated with a breach of or failure of Valvoline\u2019s information technology systems.\nThese impacts and any additional developments as a result of COVID-19, or other pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks have had adverse impacts on Valvoline's business and results of operations and may continue to adversely affect Valvoline\u2019s business, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, and forward-looking expectations, particularly if these impacts continue for an extended period of time. The extent to which the spread of COVID-19 impacts Valvoline\u2019s business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the duration and the severity of the spread of COVID-19 and the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. These events, if they continue to grow in scope, intensify in severity or are sustained for a longer period of time may materially adversely affect Valvoline\u2019s ability to implement its growth plans, including, without limitation, delay construction or acquisition of new Quick Lubes service center stores or negatively impact Valvoline\u2019s ability to successfully execute plans to enter into new markets; reduce demand for Valvoline\u2019s products and services; cause Valvoline to experience inefficiencies in the supply chain, including but not limited to, the delivery of products and services to Valvoline\u2019s customers, receipt of raw materials from suppliers or increased costs of raw materials; reduce sales or profitability; negatively impact Valvoline\u2019s ability to maintain operations; or lead to significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce the Company\u2019s ability to access capital and, in the future, negatively affect the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nValvoline uses information technology systems to conduct business, and a cyber security threat, privacy/data breach, or failure of a key information technology system could adversely affect Valvoline\u2019s business and reputation.\nValvoline relies on its information technology systems, including systems which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to conduct its business. Despite employee training and other measures to mitigate them, cyber-security threats to its information technology systems, and those of its third-party service providers, are increasing and becoming more advanced and breaches could occur as a result of denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, phishing, viruses, malicious software, ransomware, computer malware, social engineering, break-ins, security breaches or due to error or misconduct by its employees, contractors or third-party service providers. A breach of or failure of Valvoline\u2019s information technology systems could lead to the loss and destruction of trade secrets, confidential information, proprietary data, intellectual property, customer and supplier data, and employee personal information, and could disrupt business operations which could adversely affect Valvoline\u2019s relationships with business partners and harm its brands, reputation and financial results. Valvoline\u2019s customer data may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and payment account information, among other information. Depending on the nature of the customer data that is compromised, Valvoline may also have obligations to notify users, law enforcement or payment companies about the incident and may need to provide some form of remedy, such as refunds for the individuals affected by the incident. Valvoline could also face fines and penalties should it fail to adequately notify affected parties pursuant to new and evolving privacy laws in various jurisdictions in which it does business.\nBusiness disruptions from natural, operational and other catastrophic risks could seriously harm Valvoline\u2019s operations and financial performance. In addition, a catastrophic event at one of Valvoline\u2019s facilities or involving its products or employees could lead to liabilities that could further impair its operations and financial performance.\nBusiness disruptions, including those related to operating hazards inherent in the production of lubricants, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, climate change, supply or logistics disruptions, increasing costs for energy, temporary plant and/or power outages, information technology systems and network disruptions, cyber-security breaches, terrorist attacks, armed conflicts, war, pandemic diseases, fires, floods or other catastrophic events, could seriously harm Valvoline\u2019s operations, as well as the operations of Valvoline\u2019s customers and suppliers, and may adversely impact Valvoline\u2019s financial performance. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrence or consequences of any such events, they could result in reduced demand for Valvoline\u2019s products; make it difficult or impossible for Valvoline to manufacture its products, deliver products and services to its customers, or receive raw materials from suppliers; lead to increased costs of raw materials; or create delays and inefficiencies in the supply chain. In addition to leading to a serious disruption of Valvoline\u2019s businesses, a catastrophic event at one of Valvoline\u2019s facilities or involving its products or employees could lead to substantial legal liability to or claims by parties allegedly harmed by the event.\nWhile Valvoline maintains business continuity plans that are intended to allow it to continue operations or mitigate the effects of events that could disrupt its business, Valvoline cannot provide assurances that its plans would fully protect it from all such events. In addition, insurance maintained by Valvoline to protect against property damage, loss of business and other related consequences resulting from catastrophic events is subject to significant retentions and coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of Valvoline\u2019s damages or damages to others in the event of a catastrophe. In addition, insurance related to these types of risks may not be available now or, if available, may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates.\nRegulatory, legal, and financial risks\nData protection requirements could increase operating costs and requirements and a breach in information privacy or other related risks could negatively impact operations.\nValvoline is subject to federal, state, and non-U.S. laws, directives, and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personal data relating to its customers and employees. These laws, directives and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), applies to all of Valvoline\u2019s activities conducted from an establishment in the European Union (\"EU\") and may also apply to related products and services that Valvoline offers to customers in the EU. Complying with the GDPR and similar emerging and changing privacy and data protection requirements may cause Valvoline to incur substantial costs. Noncompliance with these legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection could result in penalties, legal proceedings by governmental entities or others, and significant legal and financial exposure and could affect its ability to retain and attract customers. Any failure or perceived failure by Valvoline or any third parties with which it does business to comply with these laws, rules and regulations, or with other obligations to which Valvoline may be or become subject, may result in actions against Valvoline by governmental entities, private claims and litigation, fines, penalties or other liabilities. Any such action would be expensive to defend, damage Valvoline\u2019s reputation and adversely affect business, operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nThe impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations could adversely impact Valvoline\u2019s financial performance and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase Valvoline\u2019s cost of doing business and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies. This risk includes, among other things, compliance with a myriad of U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations; anti-competition laws and regulations; product compliance regulations, including the EU\u2019s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d) regulation; anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act; anti-money-laundering laws; economic sanctions and export control laws and regulations, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d); customs laws; and other laws governing Valvoline\u2019s operations.\nAlthough Valvoline has implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, it cannot be sure that its policies and procedures are sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, distributors, consultants and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct for which Valvoline may be held responsible, nor can Valvoline be sure that its business partners have not engaged and will not engage in conduct that could materially affect their ability to perform their contractual obligations to Valvoline or even result in its being held liable for such conduct. Violations of the these laws or regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions or penalties, or significant changes in existing laws and regulations may subject Valvoline to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nValvoline\u2019s substantial indebtedness may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nValvoline has substantial indebtedness and financial obligations. As of September 30, 2020, Valvoline had outstanding indebtedness of approximately $2.0 billion, with a borrowing capacity remaining under its existing credit facilities of $548 million. Valvoline may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other general corporate purposes.\nValvoline's substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things: requiring Valvoline to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows to pay principal and interest on its debt, which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of its growth strategy and other general corporate purposes; limiting Valvoline\u2019s ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of its growth strategy and other general corporate purposes; making Valvoline more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and regulatory conditions and in its business by limiting its flexibility in planning for or reacting to changing conditions; placing Valvoline at a competitive disadvantage compared with its competitors that have less debt and lower debt service requirements; making Valvoline more vulnerable to increases in interest rates since some of its indebtedness is subject to variable rates of interest; and making it more difficult for Valvoline to satisfy its financial obligations.\nIn addition, Valvoline may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to repay its indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet its other cash needs. If Valvoline is not able to pay its debts as they become due, it could be in default under the terms of its indebtedness. Valvoline might also be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies to repay indebtedness, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring its indebtedness or selling additional debt or equity securities. Valvoline may not be able to refinance its debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or its assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if it must sell its assets, it may negatively affect Valvoline\u2019s ability to generate revenues.\nValvoline\u2019s pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations are currently underfunded, and Valvoline may have to make significant cash payments to some or all of these plans, which would reduce the cash available for its business.\nIn connection with Valvoline\u2019s separation from Ashland, Valvoline assumed certain of Ashland\u2019s historical pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related liabilities. The most significant of these plans, the U.S. qualified pension plans, are estimated to be underfunded by $158 million as of September 30, 2020. The funded status of Valvoline's pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Valvoline has taken a number of actions to reduce the risk and volatility associated with the U.S. pension plans, however, changing market conditions or laws and regulations could require material increases in the expected cash contributions to these plans in future years. Specifically, unfavorable returns on plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding. In addition, a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funded status of Valvoline\u2019s U.S. pension plans and future contributions. Similarly, an increase in discount rates could increase the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years. If any of these events occur, Valvoline may have to make significant cash payments to its U.S. pension plans, which would reduce the cash available for its business. Finally, Valvoline\u2019s policy to recognize changes in the fair value of the pension assets and liabilities annually and as otherwise required through mark to market accounting could result in volatility in Valvoline\u2019s earnings, which could be material.\nValvoline may fail to adequately protect its intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nValvoline relies heavily upon its trademarks, domain names and logos, as well as upon trade secrets, to market its brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition. Valvoline also relies on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others, to establish and protect its various intellectual property rights. For example, Valvoline has generally registered and continues to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as appropriate. Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which Valvoline\u2019s products are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available to or be registered by Valvoline, even if available.\nValvoline generally seeks to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if it deems appropriate, based on then-current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future. No assurances can be given that any patent application Valvoline has filed or will file will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate or meaningful protection against competitors or against similar technologies. In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents Valvoline owns. Furthermore, the terms of patents are finite and the patents that Valvoline owns will eventually expire after the statutory term of patent protection ends in the jurisdiction where such patents are issued.\nDespite these measures, Valvoline\u2019s intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise and third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use Valvoline\u2019s intellectual property without authorization, including its trade secrets and other confidential intellectual property. The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of Valvoline\u2019s brands and limit its ability to market its brands using its various trademarks, cause Valvoline to lose such trade secrets, as well as impede its ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar products and services, any of which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, Valvoline has been subject to legal proceedings and claims, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties. In the future, third parties may sue Valvoline for alleged infringement of their proprietary or intellectual property rights. Valvoline may not be aware of whether its products do or will infringe existing or future patents or other intellectual property rights of others. In addition, litigation may be necessary to enforce Valvoline\u2019s intellectual property rights, protect its trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation or other intellectual property proceedings of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, or loss of rights in Valvoline\u2019s intellectual property, any of which could adversely affect Valvoline\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nValvoline has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs as a result of EHS and hazardous substances liabilities and related compliance requirements. These costs could adversely impact Valvoline\u2019s cash flow, its results of operations or financial condition.\nValvoline is subject to extensive federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment and human health and safety, as well as the generation, storage, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Valvoline has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.\nEHS regulations change frequently, and such regulations and their enforcement have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, changes in EHS laws and regulations and the enforcement of such laws and regulations could interrupt Valvoline\u2019s operations, require modifications to its facilities or cause it to incur significant liabilities, costs or losses that could adversely affect its profitability. Actual or alleged violations of EHS laws and regulations could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations as well as substantial damages, penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions and remediation costs.\nValvoline\u2019s business involves the production, storage and transportation of hazardous substances. Under some environmental laws, Valvoline may be strictly liable and/or jointly and severally liable for environmental damages\ncaused by releases of hazardous substances and waste materials into the environment. For instance, under relevant laws and regulations Valvoline may be deemed liable for soil and/or groundwater contamination at sites it currently owns and/or operates even though the contamination was caused by a third party such as a former owner or operator, and at sites it formerly owned and operated if the release of hazardous substances or waste materials was caused by it or by a third party during the period it owned and/or operated the site. Valvoline also may be deemed liable for soil and/or groundwater contamination at sites to which it sent hazardous wastes for treatment or disposal, notwithstanding that the original treatment or disposal activity accorded with all applicable regulatory requirements.\nRisks related to Valvoline\u2019s separation from Ashland\nThe Distribution could result in significant tax liability to Ashland, and in certain circumstances, Valvoline could be required to indemnify Ashland for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations.\nAshland obtained a written opinion of counsel to the effect that the Distribution should qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The opinion of counsel does not address any U.S. state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences of the Distribution. The opinion assumes that the Distribution is completed according to the terms of the Separation Agreement and relies on the facts as described in the Separation Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, other ancillary agreements, the information statement distributed to Ashland\u2019s shareholders in connection with the Distribution and a number of other documents. In addition, the opinion is based on certain representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants by, Ashland and Valvoline. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect.\nThe opinion of counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or the courts, and thus there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. Ashland has not requested, and to the best of Valvoline's knowledge does not intend to request, a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Distribution.\nIf the Distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, then Ashland would recognize a gain as if it had sold its Valvoline common stock in a taxable transaction in an amount up to the fair market value of the common stock it distributed in the Distribution. In addition, certain reorganization transactions undertaken in connection with the separation and the Distribution could be determined to be taxable, which could result in additional taxable gain. Under certain circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, Valvoline could have a substantial indemnification obligation to Ashland with respect to the tax associated with some or all of such gain, which could have a material adverse impact on Valvoline's financial condition.\nValvoline will have joint and several liability with Ashland for the consolidated U.S. federal income taxes of the Ashland consolidated group for the taxable periods in which Valvoline was part of the Ashland consolidated group. In addition, Valvoline has agreed to indemnify Ashland for certain pre-IPO U.S. taxes that arise on audit and are directly attributable to neither the Valvoline business nor Ashland\u2019s specialty ingredients and performance materials businesses (collectively, the \u201cChemicals business\u201d).\nValvoline and Ashland as well as their respective subsidiaries were part of U.S. federal consolidated group tax returns and certain combined or similar group tax returns (together, \u201cCombined Tax Returns\u201d) through the date of the Distribution. Therefore, Valvoline has joint and several liability with Ashland to the respective taxing authorities for the Combined Tax Returns for the periods up to and including the date of the Distribution.\nPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, Valvoline is required to indemnify Ashland for: (a) certain U.S. federal, state or local taxes of Ashland and/or its subsidiaries for any tax period ending on or prior to the (i) Distribution that arise on audit or examination and are directly attributable to Valvoline or (ii) IPO that arise on audit or examination and are directly attributable to neither the Valvoline business nor the Chemicals business; and (b) certain non-U.S. taxes of Ashland and/or its subsidiaries for any tax period ending on or prior to the Distribution that arise on audit or examination and are directly attributable to Valvoline. This indemnification obligation could be material if Ashland receives a material tax assessment for pre-IPO tax periods, several of which are currently under IRS audit.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement also requires Valvoline to indemnify Ashland for any taxes (and reasonable expenses) resulting from the failure of the Distribution to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss or certain reorganization transactions related to the separation or the IPO and Distribution to qualify for their intended tax treatment\n(\u201cTransaction Taxes\u201d), where the taxes result from: (1) breaches of representations or covenants that Valvoline made or agreed to in connection with these transactions, (2) the application of certain provisions of U.S. federal income tax law to the Distribution with respect to acquisitions of Valvoline common stock or (3) any other actions that Valvoline knows or reasonably should expect would give rise to such taxes.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement also requires Valvoline to indemnify Ashland for a portion of certain other taxes arising from the separation allocated to Valvoline generally based on Valvoline\u2019s market capitalization relative to the market capitalization of Ashland at the time of the Distribution.\nValvoline\u2019s inability to resolve favorably any disputes that arise between Valvoline and Ashland with respect to their past relationship may adversely affect its operating results.\nDisputes may arise between Ashland and Valvoline in a number of areas relating to their past relationship, including labor; tax; employee benefits, including pension liabilities; indemnification; services provided to one another; and other matters arising from Valvoline\u2019s separation from Ashland. Valvoline may not be able to resolve disputes with Ashland, and even if it does, the resolution may not be favorable and could adversely affect Valvoline\u2019s operating results.\nAshland has agreed to indemnify Valvoline for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure Valvoline against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Ashland\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement entered into between Ashland and Valvoline (the \u201cSeparation Agreement\u201d) and certain other agreements with Ashland, Ashland agreed to indemnify Valvoline for certain liabilities. However, third parties could also seek to hold Valvoline responsible for any of the liabilities that Ashland agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Ashland will be sufficient to protect Valvoline against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Ashland will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future. Even if Valvoline ultimately succeeded in recovering from Ashland any amounts for which Valvoline is held liable, Valvoline may be temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect Valvoline\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 16338, "SIC": 2990, "TIC": "VVV"}
