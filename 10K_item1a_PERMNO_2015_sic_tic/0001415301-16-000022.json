{"cik": "1415301", "company": "Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nChanges in general economic conditions, including economic uncertainty, have adversely impacted our business and results of operations, may continue to do so and may do so in the future.\nPurchases at our restaurants are discretionary for consumers and we are therefore susceptible to economic slowdowns. We believe that consumers generally are more willing to make discretionary purchases, including high-end restaurant meals, during favorable economic conditions. The recent economic uncertainty, continuing disruptions in the overall economy, including high unemployment and financial market volatility and unpredictability, and the related reduction in consumer confidence negatively affected customer traffic and sales throughout our industry, including our segment. If the economy experiences a new downturn or there are continued uncertainties regarding U.S. budgetary and fiscal policies, our customers, including our business clientele, may further reduce their level of discretionary spending, impacting the frequency with which they choose to dine out or the amount they spend on meals while dining out. We believe the majority of our weekday revenues in our Del Frisco\u2019s and Sullivan\u2019s concepts are derived from business customers using expense accounts and our business therefore may be affected by reduced expense account or other business-related dining by our business clientele. If business clientele were to dine less frequently at our restaurants, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of a reduction in customer traffic or average revenues per customer.\nThere is also a risk that if uncertain economic conditions persist for an extended period of time or worsen, consumers might make long-lasting changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including dining out less frequently. The ability of the U.S. economy to handle this uncertainty is likely to be affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control. These factors, including national, regional and local politics and economic conditions, disposable consumer income and consumer confidence, also affect discretionary consumer spending. Continued uncertainty in or a worsening of the economy, generally or in a number of our markets, and our customers\u2019 reactions to these trends could adversely affect our business and cause us to, among other things, reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings, close restaurants and delay our re-modeling of existing locations.\nIf our restaurants are not able to compete successfully with other restaurants, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur industry is intensely competitive with respect to price, quality of service, restaurant location, ambiance of facilities and type and quality of food. A substantial number of national and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants compete with us for customers, restaurant locations and qualified management and other restaurant staff. The principal competitors for our Del Frisco\u2019s and Sullivan\u2019s concepts are other upscale steakhouse chains such as Fleming\u2019s Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar, The Capital Grille, Smith & Wollensky, The Palm, Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House and Morton\u2019s The Steakhouse. The principal competitors for our Grille concept also include other upscale chains such as Hillstone, Paul Martin\u2019s American Grill and Earl\u2019s Kitchen + Bar. Our concepts also compete with additional restaurants in the broader upscale dining segment. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources, have been in business longer, have greater name recognition and are better established in the markets where our restaurants are located or where we may expand. Our inability to compete successfully with other restaurants may harm our ability to maintain acceptable levels of revenue growth, limit or otherwise inhibit our ability to grow one or more of our concepts, or force us to close one or more of our restaurants. We may also need to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or concepts that emerge from time to time, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so or that any changes we make to any of our concepts in response will be successful or not adversely affect our profitability. In addition, with improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quick-service restaurants combined with the effects of uncertain economic conditions and other factors, consumers may choose less expensive alternatives, which could also negatively affect customer traffic at our restaurants. Any unanticipated slowdown in demand at any of our restaurants due to industry competition may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to open new restaurants and operate them profitably, and if we are unable to successfully execute this strategy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur financial success depends in part on management\u2019s ability to execute our growth strategy. One key element of our growth strategy is opening new restaurants. We believe there are opportunities to open six to eight new restaurants annually, generally composed of one Del Frisco\u2019s and five to seven Sullivan\u2019s and/or Grilles, with new openings of our Grille concept likely serving as the primary driver of new unit growth in the near term. In 2015, we opened a Del Frisco\u2019s in Orlando, Florida as well as Grilles in The Woodlands, Texas, Plano, Texas, Stamford, Connecticut, Little Rock, Arkansas, Hoboken, New Jersey and Cherry Creek, Colorado. In 2016 we expect to open two to three Grilles and relocate one Del Frisco\u2019s. For the opening of a new restaurant, we measure our cash investment costs net of landlord contributions and equipment financing, but including pre-opening costs. We target average cash investment costs of $7.0 million to $9.0 million for a new Del Frisco\u2019s and $3.0 million to $4.5 million for a new Sullivan\u2019s or Grille.\nOur ability to open new restaurants and operate them profitably is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022finding quality site locations, competing effectively to obtain quality site locations and reaching acceptable agreements to lease or purchase sites;\n\u2022complying with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations and obtaining, for an acceptable cost, required permits and approvals;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u2022having adequate capital for construction and opening costs and efficiently managing the time and resources committed to building and opening each new restaurant;\n\u2022timely hiring and training and retaining the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs;\n\u2022successfully promoting our new locations and competing in their markets;\n\u2022acquiring food and other supplies for new restaurants from local suppliers; and\n\u2022addressing unanticipated problems or risks that may arise during the development or opening of a new restaurant or entering a new market.\nA new restaurant typically experiences a \u201cramp-up\u201d period of approximately 18 months before it achieves our targeted level of performance. This is due to the costs associated with opening a new restaurant, as well as higher operating costs caused by start-up and other temporary inefficiencies associated with opening new restaurants. For example, there are a number of factors which may impact the amount of time and money we commit to the construction and development of new restaurants, including landlord delays, shortages of skilled labor, labor disputes, shortages of materials, delays in obtaining necessary permits, local government regulations and weather interference. Once the restaurant is open, how quickly it achieves a desired level of profitability is impacted by many factors, including the level of market familiarity and acceptance when we enter new markets, as well as the availability of experienced staff and the time required to negotiate reasonable prices for services and other supplies from local suppliers. Our business and profitability may be adversely affected if the \u201cramp-up\u201d period for a new restaurant lasts longer than we expect.\nIf we are unable to increase our sales or maintain our margins at existing restaurants, our profitability and overall results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAnother key aspect of our growth strategy is increasing comparable restaurant sales and maintaining restaurant-level margins. Improving comparable restaurant sales and maintaining restaurant-level margins depends in part on whether we achieve revenue growth through increases in the average check and further expand our private dining business at each restaurant. We believe there are opportunities to increase the average check at our restaurants through, for example, selective introduction of higher priced items and increases in menu pricing. We also believe that expanding and enhancing our private dining capacity will also increase our restaurant sales, as our private dining business typically has a higher average check and higher overall margins than regular dining room business. However, these strategies may prove unsuccessful, especially in times of economic hardship, as customers may not order or enjoy higher priced items and discretionary spending on private dining events may decrease. Select price increases have not historically adversely impacted customer traffic; however, we expect that there is a price level at which point customer traffic would be adversely affected. It is also possible that these changes could cause our sales volume to decrease. If we are not able to increase our sales at existing restaurants for any reason, our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe failure to continue to successfully develop our Grille concept could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe launched our new concept, the Grille, in the third quarter of 2011 with the opening of our New York City location. We opened a second location in Dallas, Texas in the fourth quarter of 2011. We opened three additional locations in 2012, six locations in 2013, five locations in 2014 and locations in The Woodlands, Texas, Plano, Texas, Stamford, Connecticut, Little Rock, Arkansas, Hoboken, New Jersey and Cherry Creek, Colorado in 2015. We also closed two locations in Phoenix, Arizona and Palm Beach, Florida in 2015. We believe that new openings of the Grille are likely to serve as the primary driver of new unit growth in the near term. Our ability to continue to succeed with this new concept will require significant capital expenditures and management attention and is subject to certain risks in addition to those of opening a new restaurant under one of our existing concepts, including customer acceptance of and competition to that concept. If the \u201cramp-up\u201d period for our Grille restaurants and for our development of concepts in general does not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, we are targeting restaurant-level EBITDA margins of between 20% and 25% for the Grille. However, because we face new challenges at the Grille as we enter new markets, we cannot provide any assurance that our operating margins will achieve these levels. As a result, we may need to adjust our pricing and menu offering strategies. We may not be successful enough to recoup our investments in the concept. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in further developing and growing the Grille or in developing and growing any other new concept to a point where it will become profitable or generate positive cash flow or that it will prove to be a platform for future expansion. We may not be able to attract enough customers to meet targeted levels of performance at new restaurants because potential customers may be unfamiliar with our concepts or the atmosphere or menu might not appeal to them. Some Grille locations may even operate at a loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall operating results. In addition, while we have not experienced this thus far, opening a new restaurant concept such as a Grille in an existing market could reduce the revenue of our existing restaurants in that market. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies for the Grille, or if customer traffic generated by the Grille results in a decline in customer traffic at one of our other restaurants in the same market, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur growth, including the continued development of the Grille, may strain our infrastructure and resources, which could delay the opening of new restaurants and adversely affect our ability to manage our existing restaurants.\nWe plan to continue new restaurant growth, including the continued development and promotion of the Grille. We believe there are opportunities to open six to eight restaurants annually, generally composed of one Del Frisco\u2019s and five to seven Sullivan\u2019s and/or Grilles, with new openings of our Grille concept likely serving as the primary driver of new unit growth in the near term. During 2016 we expect to open two to three Grilles and relocate one Del Frisco\u2019s. We typically target an average cash investment of approximately $7.0 million to $9.0 million per restaurant for a Del Frisco\u2019s restaurant and $3.0 million to $4.5 million for a Sullivan\u2019s or a Grille, in each case net of landlord contributions and equipment financing and including pre-opening costs. In addition to new openings, we also may \u201crefresh\u201d a number of our Del Frisco\u2019s and Sullivan\u2019s locations to, among other things, add additional seating, further grow our private dining business and add patio seating. During 2015, we completed the refresh of one Sullivan\u2019s. Looking forward, we expect to complete two to four refreshes each year at an approximate cost of $0.5 million per location. This growth and these investments will increase our operating complexity and place increased demands on our management as well as our human resources, purchasing and site management teams. While we have committed significant resources to expanding our current restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems in connection with our recent growth, if this infrastructure is insufficient to support this expansion, our ability to open new restaurants, including the continued development and promotion of the Grille, and to manage our existing restaurants, including the expansion of our private dining business, would be adversely affected. If we fail to continue to improve our infrastructure or if our improved infrastructure fails, we may be unable to implement our growth strategy or maintain current levels of operating performance in our existing restaurants.\nOur New York Del Frisco\u2019s location represents a significant portion of our revenues, and any significant downturn in its business or disruption in the operation of this location could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur New York Del Frisco\u2019s location represented approximately 14%, 13% and 12% of our revenues in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Accordingly, we are susceptible to any fluctuations in the business at our New York Del Frisco\u2019s location, whether as a result of adverse economic conditions, negative publicity, changes in customer preferences or for other reasons. In addition, any natural disaster, prolonged inclement weather, act of terrorism or national emergency, accident, system failure or other unforeseen event in or around New York City could result in a temporary or permanent closing of this location, could influence potential customers to avoid this geographic region or this location in particular or otherwise lead to a decrease in revenues. Any significant interruption in the operation of this location or other reduction in sales could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nNegative customer experiences or negative publicity surrounding our restaurants or other restaurants could adversely affect sales in one or more of our restaurants and make our brands less valuable.\nThe quality of our food and our restaurant facilities are two of our competitive strengths. Therefore, adverse publicity, whether or not accurate, relating to food quality, public health concerns, illness, safety, injury or government or industry findings concerning our restaurants, restaurants operated by other foodservice providers or others across the food industry supply chain could affect us more than it would other restaurants that compete primarily on price or other factors. A restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky has the right to use, and uses, a specific registration of the Del Frisco\u2019s name pursuant to a concurrent use agreement, as described in greater detail in \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property.\u201d We do not own or control the Louisville restaurant, but any adverse publicity relating to those operations could negatively affect us. In addition, although we would not be legally liable for any such failure, because the Louisville restaurant operates under one of our brand names, we may be subject to litigation as a result of the restaurant\u2019s failure to comply with food quality, preparation or other applicable rules and regulations. If customers perceive or experience a reduction in our food quality, service or ambiance or in any way believe we have failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, the value and popularity of one or more of our concepts could suffer. Any shifts in consumer preferences away from the kinds of food we offer, particularly beef, whether because of dietary or other health concerns or otherwise, would make our restaurants less appealing and could reduce customer traffic and/or impose practical limits on pricing.\nNegative publicity relating to the consumption of beef, including in connection with food-borne illness, could result in reduced consumer demand for our menu offerings, which could reduce sales.\nInstances of food-borne illness, including Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, which is also known as BSE or mad cow disease, aphthous fever, which is also known as hoof and mouth disease, as well as hepatitis A, lysteria, salmonella and e-coli, whether or not found in the United States or traced directly to one of our suppliers or our restaurants, could reduce demand for our menu offerings. Any negative publicity relating to these and other health-related matters, such as the confirmation of a case of mad cow disease in a dairy cow in California in April 2012, may affect consumers\u2019 perceptions of our restaurants and the food that we offer, reduce customer visits to our restaurants and negatively impact demand for our menu offerings. Adverse publicity relating to any of these matters, beef in general or other similar concerns could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIncreases in the prices of, and/or reductions in the availability of commodities, primarily beef, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, which have a substantial effect on our total costs. For example, we purchase large quantities of beef, particularly USDA prime beef and premium choice beef. Our beef costs represented approximately 33%, 34% and 34% of our food and beverage costs during 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and we currently do not purchase beef pursuant to any long-term contractual arrangements with fixed pricing or use futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to potential price fluctuations. The market for USDA prime beef and premium choice beef is particularly volatile and is subject to extreme price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions,\nthe price of feed, industry demand, energy demand and other factors. For example, during 2011 and 2012, beef costs were impacted by (i) the summer drought in Texas and Oklahoma, (ii) the price of corn, (iii) the entrance of major supermarkets into the USDA choice beef market and (iv) new free trade agreements increasing exports. Although we currently do not engage in futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies with respect to potential price fluctuations, from time to time, we may opportunistically enter into fixed price beef supply contracts or contracts for other food products or consider other risk management strategies with regard to our meat and other food costs to minimize the impact of potential price fluctuations. This practice could help stabilize our food costs during times of fluctuating prices, although there can be no assurances that this will occur. However, because our restaurants feature USDA prime beef and premium choice beef, we generally expect to purchase these types of beef even if we have not entered into any such arrangements and the price increased significantly. The prices of other commodities can affect our costs as well, including corn and other grains, which are ingredients we use regularly and are also used as cattle feed and therefore affect the price of beef. Energy prices can also affect our bottom line, as increased energy prices may cause increased transportation costs for beef and other supplies, as well as increased costs for the utilities required to run each restaurant. Historically we have passed increased commodity and other costs on to our customers by increasing the prices of our menu items. While we believe these price increases did not historically affect our customer traffic, there can be no assurance additional price increases would not affect future customer traffic. If prices increase in the future and we are unable to anticipate or mitigate these increases, or if there are shortages for USDA Prime beef and premium choice beef, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon frequent deliveries of food and other supplies, in most cases from a limited number of suppliers, which subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations.\nOur ability to maintain consistent quality throughout our restaurants depends in part upon our ability to acquire fresh products, including USDA prime beef and premium choice beef, fresh seafood, quality produce and related items from reliable sources in accordance with our specifications. In addition, we rely on one or a limited number of suppliers for certain ingredients. For example, Stock Yards, a division of U.S. Foods, Inc., is the primary supplier of the beef for all of our restaurants and has been so since June 2009. This dependence on one or a limited number of suppliers, as well as the limited number of alternative suppliers of USDA prime beef and premium choice beef and quality seafood, subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations in beef and seafood. If any of our suppliers is unable to obtain financing necessary to operate its business or its business is otherwise adversely affected, does not perform adequately or otherwise fails to distribute products or supplies to our restaurants, or terminates or refuses to renew any contract with us, particularly with respect to one of the suppliers on which we rely heavily for specific ingredients, we may be unable to find an alternative supplier in a short period of time or if we can, it may not be on acceptable terms. Our inability to replace our suppliers in a short period of time on acceptable terms could increase our costs or cause shortages at our restaurants that may cause us to remove certain items from a menu, increase the price of certain offerings or temporarily close a restaurant, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, and our business and growth strategy could be materially harmed if we were to lose these executives and were unable to replace them with executives of equal experience and capabilities.\nSome of our senior executives, such as Mark S. Mednansky, our Chief Executive Officer, are particularly important to our success because they have been instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, identifying expansion opportunities and arranging necessary financing. We have employment agreements with all members of senior management; however, we cannot prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us. Losing the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement could be found. We also believe that they could not quickly be replaced with executives of equal experience and capabilities and their successors may not be as effective. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executives.\nChanges in consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe restaurant industry is characterized by the continual introduction of new concepts and is subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences, tastes and eating and purchasing habits. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, as well as other factors affecting the restaurant industry, including new market entrants and demographic changes. Shifts in consumer preferences away from upscale steakhouses or beef, which is a significant component of our Del Frisco\u2019s and Sullivan\u2019s concepts\u2019 menus and appeal, whether as a result of economic, competitive or other factors, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRestaurant companies, including ours, have been the target of class action lawsuits and other proceedings alleging, among other things, violations of federal and state workplace and employment laws. Proceedings of this nature, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial damages.\nIn recent years, we and other restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, the sharing of tips amongst certain employees, overtime eligibility of assistant managers and failure to pay for all hours worked. Although we maintain what we believe to be adequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these matters. Accordingly, if we are required to pay substantial damages and expenses as a result of these types or other lawsuits our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOccasionally, our customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to one of our restaurants, including actions seeking damages resulting from food-borne illness and relating to notices with respect to chemicals contained in food products required under state law. We are also subject to a variety of other claims from third parties arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state laws. In addition, our restaurants are subject to state \u201cdram shop\u201d or similar laws which generally allow a person to sue us if that person was injured by a legally intoxicated person who was wrongfully served alcoholic beverages at one of our restaurants. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers. In addition, we may also be subject to lawsuits from our employees or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants.\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations. In addition, they may generate negative publicity, which could reduce customer traffic and sales. Although we maintain what we believe to be adequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to substantial government regulation.\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations related to the preparation and sale of food, the sale of alcoholic beverages, the sale and use of tobacco, zoning and building codes, land use and employee, health, sanitation and safety matters. For example, the preparation, storing and serving of food and the use of certain ingredients is subject to heavy regulation. Alcoholic beverage control regulations govern various aspects of our restaurants\u2019 daily operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control, handling and storage. Typically our restaurants\u2019 licenses to sell alcoholic beverages must be renewed annually and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause. In addition, because we operate in a number of different states, we are also required to comply with a number of different laws covering the same topics. The failure of any of our restaurants to timely obtain and maintain necessary governmental approvals, including liquor or other licenses, permits or approvals required to serve alcoholic beverages or food could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant or prevent regular day-to-day operations, including the sale of alcoholic beverages, at a restaurant that is already operating, any of which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, the costs of operating our restaurants may increase if there are changes in laws governing minimum hourly wages, working conditions, overtime and tip credits, health care, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, unemployment tax rates, sales taxes or other laws and regulations such as those governing access for the disabled, including the Americans with Disabilities Act. For example, the Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, which was enacted on March 23, 2010, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements and imposes new taxes on health insurers and health care benefits that could increase the costs of providing health benefits to employees. In addition, because we have a significant number of restaurants located in certain states, regulatory changes in these states could have a disproportionate impact on our business. If any of the foregoing increased costs and we were unable to offset the change by increasing our menu prices or by other means, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGovernment regulation can also affect customer traffic at our restaurants. A number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information. For example, the PPACA establishes a uniform, federal requirement for restaurant chains with 20 or more locations operating under the same trade name and offering substantially the same menus to post nutritional information on their menus, including the total number of calories. The law also requires such restaurants to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information, including total calories and calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fiber, and total protein in each serving size or other unit of measure, for each standard menu item. The FDA is also permitted to require additional nutrient disclosures, such as trans-fat content. In 2015 our Grille concept became subject to the requirements to post nutritional information on our menus or in our restaurants because we now operate 20 Grille locations. The compliance deadline is December 1, 2016 and we intend to comply with these requirements before the deadline. Our compliance with the PPACA or other\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsimilar laws to which we may become subject could reduce demand for our menu offerings, reduce customer traffic and/or reduce average revenue per customer, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue. Any reduction in customer traffic related to these or other government regulations could affect revenues and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTo the extent that governmental regulations impose new or additional obligations on our suppliers, including, without limitation, regulations relating to the inspection or preparation of meat, food and other products used in our business, product availability could be limited and the prices that our suppliers charge us could increase. We may not be able to offset these costs through increased menu prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If any of our restaurants were unable to serve particular food products, even for a short period of time, or if we are unable to offset increased costs, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLabor shortages or changes to wage laws could harm our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including restaurant managers, kitchen staff and servers, necessary to keep pace with our anticipated expansion schedule and meet the needs of our existing restaurants. A sufficient number of qualified individuals of the requisite caliber to fill these positions may be in short supply in some communities. Competition in these communities for qualified staff could require us to pay higher wages and provide greater benefits. Any inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may also delay the planned openings of new restaurants and could adversely impact our existing restaurants. Any such inability to retain or recruit qualified employees, increased costs of attracting qualified employees or delays in restaurant openings could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid wage rates at or based on the federal or state minimum wage and who rely on tips as a large portion of their income. Any changes in the city, state, or federal laws affecting the wages we pay our employees, including an increase in the minimum wage, such as the 18% increase in the minimum wage on January 1, 2016 in Seattle, Washington to $13.00 per hour or the 11% increase in minimum wage in California to $9.00, could increase our costs and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Certain other states in which we operate restaurants have adopted or are considering adopting minimum wage statutes that exceed the federal minimum wage as well. We may be unable or unwilling to increase our prices in order to pass these increased labor costs on to our customers, in which case, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe occupy most of our restaurants under long-term non-cancelable leases for which we may remain obligated to perform under even after a restaurant closes, and we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. We also guarantee three leases with third parties for former affiliates of Lone Star Fund.\nAll but two of our restaurants are located in leased premises. Many of our current leases are non-cancelable and typically have terms ranging from five to 15 years with renewal options for terms ranging from five to 10 years. We believe that leases that we enter into in the future will be on substantially similar terms. If we were to close or fail to open a restaurant at a location we lease, we would generally remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which could include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. For example, in 2015 we paid $3.1 million to exit two Grille leases. Our obligation to continue making rental payments and fulfilling other lease obligations in respect of leases for closed or unopened restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Alternatively, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a restaurant, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we cannot renew such a lease we may be forced to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks. We also guarantee three leases entered into by various operating subsidiaries of Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon that were entered into by certain of the Casual Dining Companies prior to the acquisition of Lone Star Steakhouse and Saloon by Lone Star Fund, which is discussed in greater detail in \u201cBusiness\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d At December 29, 2015, the maximum potential amount of future lease payments we could be required to make as a result of the guarantees was $0.2 million. The entities that are party to these leases are not controlled or managed by us. See Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. If we are required to make payments under one of our leases after a restaurant closes or one of the leases that we guarantee, or if we are unable to renew our restaurant leases, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe impact of negative economic factors, including the availability of credit, on our landlords and other retail center tenants could negatively affect our financial results.\nNegative effects on our existing and potential landlords due to any inaccessibility of credit and other unfavorable economic factors may, in turn, adversely affect our business and results of operations. If our landlords are unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, they may be unable to provide construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. If any landlord files for bankruptcy protection, the landlord may be able to reject our lease in the bankruptcy proceedings. While we would have the option to retain our rights under the lease, we could not compel the landlord to perform any of its obligations and would be left with damages as our sole recourse. In addition, if our landlords are unable to obtain sufficient credit to continue to properly manage their retail sites, we may experience a drop in the level of quality of such retail centers. Our development of new restaurants may also be adversely affected by the negative financial situations of developers and potential landlords. In recent years, many landlords have delayed or cancelled development projects (as well as renovations of existing projects)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndue to the instability in the credit markets and declines in consumer spending, which has reduced the number of high-quality locations available that we would consider for our new restaurants. In addition, several other tenants at retail centers in which we are located or where we have executed leases have ceased operations or, in some cases, have deferred openings or failed to open after committing to do so. These failures may lead to reduced customer traffic and a general deterioration in the surrounding retail centers in which our restaurants are located and may contribute to lower customer traffic at our restaurants. If any of the foregoing affect any of our landlords or their other retail tenants our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFixed rental payments account for a significant portion of our operating expenses, which increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our operating and financing flexibility.\nPayments under our operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and we expect the new restaurants we open in the future will similarly be leased by us. Specifically, payments under our operating leases accounted for 12.8%, 13.4% and 13.2% of our restaurant operating expenses in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our available cash flow to be applied to our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022placing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease obligations and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our credit facility or other sources, we may not be able to meet our operating lease obligations, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAny future indebtedness we may incur may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.\nWe currently have a credit facility that provides for a revolving loan of up to $30.0 million. There were $4.5 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility at December 29, 2015. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our credit facility, and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022the requirement that we use a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest on any outstanding indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes; and\n\u2022our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited.\nWe expect that we will depend primarily on cash generated by our operations for funds to pay our expenses and any amounts due under our credit facility and any other indebtedness we may incur. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and our currently anticipated growth in revenues and cash flows may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have enough money, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money, in each case on terms that are not acceptable to us. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including our existing credit facility, may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our ability to recapitalize and incur additional debt in the future could also delay or prevent a change in control of our company, make some transactions more difficult and impose additional financial or other covenants on us. In addition, any significant levels of indebtedness in the future could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our indebtedness and any inability to pay our debt obligations as they come due or inability to incur additional debt could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe terms of our credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us.\nOur credit facility contains a number of significant restrictions and covenants that generally limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022pay dividends or purchase stock or make other restricted payments to our stockholders;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022issue guarantees;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022sell assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022make capital expenditures;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022sell equity or other ownership interests in our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022create or permit restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make payments to us.\nOur credit facility limits our ability to engage in these types of transactions even if we believed that a specific transaction would contribute to our future growth or improve our operating results. Our credit facility also requires us to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Specifically, these covenants require that we have a fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than 2.00 and a leverage ratio of less than 1.00. As of December 29, 2015, we were in compliance with these tests. See Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these provisions or our inability to comply with required financial ratios in our credit facility could result in a default under the credit facility in which case the lenders will have the right to declare all borrowings to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay all borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to secure the indebtedness. If we breach these covenants or fail to comply with the terms of the credit facility and the lenders accelerate the amounts outstanding under the credit facility our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur credit facility carries floating interest rates, thereby exposing us to market risk related to changes in interest rates to the extent there are borrowings outstanding thereunder. Accordingly, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Assuming a one percentage point increase on our base interest rate on our credit facility and a full drawdown on the credit facility, our interest expense would increase by approximately $0.3 million over the course of 12 months.\nThe failure to enforce and maintain our intellectual property rights could enable others to use names confusingly similar to the names and marks used by our restaurants, which could adversely affect the value of our brands.\nWe have registered the names Del Frisco\u2019s, Double Eagle Steak House, Sullivan\u2019s, Del Frisco\u2019s Grille and have applications pending to register certain other names and logos used by our restaurants as trade names, trademarks or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We have the exclusive right to use these trademarks throughout the United States, other than with respect to one restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, including the 50 mile surrounding area, where an unrelated third party has the right to use a specific registration of the Del Frisco\u2019s name in Jefferson and Fayette Counties in Kentucky, Marion County in Indiana and Hamilton County in Ohio. See Item 1, Business. The success of our business depends in part on our continued ability to utilize our existing trade names, trademarks and service marks as currently used in order to increase our brand awareness. In that regard, we believe that our trade names, trademarks and service marks are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized use or other misappropriation of our trade names, trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and restaurant concepts and may cause a decline in our revenues and force us to incur costs related to enforcing our rights. In addition, the use of trade names, trademarks or service marks similar to ours in some markets may keep us from entering those markets. While we may take protective actions with respect to our intellectual property, these actions may not be sufficient to prevent, and we may not be aware of all incidents of, unauthorized usage or imitation by others. Any such unauthorized usage or imitation of our intellectual property, including the costs related to enforcing our rights, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nInformation technology system failures or breaches of our network security, including with respect to confidential information, could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including point-of-sale processing at our restaurants. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems. Any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities. In addition, the majority of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their customers has been stolen. If this or another type of breach occurs at one of our restaurants, we may become subject to negative publicity as well as lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our customers\u2019 credit or debit card information. Although we employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our systems, controls, firewalls and encryption and intend to maintain and upgrade our security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage, breaches or other disruptive problems, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful. Any such claim, proceeding or action by a regulatory authority, or any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe expect to issue options, restricted stock and other forms of stock-based compensation in the future, which have the potential to dilute stockholder value and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of December 29, 2015, we had options outstanding to purchase 1,221,100 shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan, 714,600 of which have vested and are currently exercisable and restricted stock outstanding of 90,379 shares of common stock. In addition, we expect to offer stock options, restricted stock and other forms of stock-based compensation to our directors, officers and employees in the future. If the options that we issue are exercised, or any restricted stock or other rewards that we may issue vests, and those shares are sold into the public market, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, the availability of shares of common stock for award under our equity incentive plan, or the grant of stock options, restricted stock or other forms of stock-based compensation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a holding company and depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company with no material assets other than the equity interests of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets and intellectual property. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations and pay any future dividends to our stockholders depends upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by our subsidiaries directly or indirectly to us in the form of dividends, distributions and other payments. Any inability on the part of our subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions of our charter documents, Delaware law and other documents could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022permit us to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each series, fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers, if any, of the shares of the series and the preferences and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of the shares of the series;\n\u2022prevent stockholders from calling special meetings;\n\u2022prevent the ability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022limit the ability of stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022require advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals; and\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms.\nThese provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of our company, including a transaction in which the acquiror may offer a premium price for our common stock.\nWe are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder. In addition, our equity incentive plan permits vesting of stock options and restricted stock, and payments to be made to the employees thereunder in certain circumstances, in connection with a change of control of our company, which could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if we will be able to maintain such status.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, and we have adopted certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d These exemptions include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We may remain as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five full fiscal years following our initial public offering, which occurred July 26, 2012. We would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and therefore not be able to rely upon the above exemptions, if we have more than $1 billion in annual revenues in a fiscal year, we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period or we have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of any June 30 before the end of the five full fiscal years.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide an unqualified report on our internal controls.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules adopted by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, once we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act and lose the ability to rely on the exemptions related thereto discussed above, our independent registered public accounting firm will also need to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. If we conclude and, once we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm concludes, that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, investor confidence and our stock price could decline.\nMatters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of NASDAQ listing rules, and result in a breach of the covenants under our financing arrangements. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us and lead to a decline in the price of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we incur significant costs and face demands on our management to comply with the SEC and NASDAQ requirements.\nWe are required as a public company to comply with an extensive body of regulations, including provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and NASDAQ. These rules and regulations could result in substantial legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, and these costs and demands may increase after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d In addition, we incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and maintaining directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. Furthermore, our management has increased demands on its time in order to ensure we comply with public company reporting requirements and the compliance requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as any rules and requirements subsequently implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, the FASB, together with the International Accounting Standards Board, has issued a comprehensive set of changes in accounting for leases. The lease accounting model is a \u201cright of use\u201d model that assumes that each lease creates an asset (the lessee\u2019s right to use the leased asset) and a liability (the future rent payment obligations) which should be reflected on a lessee\u2019s balance sheet to fairly represent the lease transaction and the lessee\u2019s related financial obligations. All of our restaurant leases are accounted for as operating leases, with no related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. However, changes in lease accounting rules or their interpretation, or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. In addition, the SEC has announced a multi-year plan that could ultimately lead to the use of International Financial Reporting Standards by U.S. issuers in their SEC filings. Any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results.", "PERMNO": 13524, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "DFRG"}
