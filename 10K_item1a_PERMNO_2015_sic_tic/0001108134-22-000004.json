RISK FACTORS\nThe risks set forth below, in addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, strategic objectives, and operating results. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, strategic objectives, or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic affected all aspects of the company\u2019s business in 2021 and 2020. The impact of the pandemic is discussed in the \"Operating\" risk factors below, but it should be understood as affecting the overall risk environment and risk factors of the Company.\nRisk Factors Summary\nLending Risks\n\u2022Deterioration in the Housing Sector, Commercial Real Estate, and Related Markets May Adversely Affect Business and Financial Results.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s Emphasis on Commercial Lending May Expose the Company to Increased Lending Risks, Which Could Hurt Profits.\n\u2022The Company is Subject to a Variety of Risks in Connection With Any Sale of Loans it May Conduct.\n\u2022The Company is Exposed to Risk of Environmental Liability When It Takes Title to Property.\n\u2022New Third Party Lending Relationships and Sourcing Channels May Increase Lending Risk\nOperating Risks\n\u2022The COVID-19 Pandemic is Adversely Affecting, and Will Likely Continue to Adversely Affect, the Company\u2019s Business, Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Results of Operations.\n\u2022The Company is Subject to Security and Operational Risks Relating to the Use of Technology that Could Damage the Company's Reputation and Business.\n\u2022The Company Faces Cybersecurity Risks, Including Denial of Service Attacks, Ransomware, Hacking and Identity Theft that Could Result in the Disclosure of Confidential Information or the Creation of Unauthorized Transactions, Which Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business or Reputation and Create Significant Legal and Financial Exposure.\n\u2022Counterparties and Correspondents Expose the Company to Risks.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s Business is Reliant on Outside Vendors.\n\u2022Development of New Products and Services May Impose Additional Costs on the Company and May Expose It to Increased Operational Risk.\n\u2022The Discontinuation of LIBOR and the Emergence of One or More Alternative Benchmark Indices to Replace LIBOR Could Adversely Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Results of Operations.\nLiquidity Risks\n\u2022The Company's Wholesale Funding Sources May Prove Insufficient to Replace Deposits at Maturity and Support Operations and Future Growth.\n\u2022The Company's Ability to Service Our Debt, Pay Dividends, and Otherwise Pay Obligations as They Come Due Is Substantially Dependent on Capital Distributions from the Bank, and These Distributions Are Subject to Regulatory Limits and Other Restrictions. The Company\u2019s Stock Repurchase Program is also Dependent on These Distributions.\n\u2022The Loss Recorded in 2020 May Have an Adverse Effect on Future Dividend Payments to Common Shareholders.\n\u2022Secondary Mortgage Market Conditions Could Have a Material Impact on the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nInterest Rates\n\u2022Market Interest Rate Conditions Could Adversely Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nSecurities Market Value Risks\n\u2022Declines in the Value of Certain Investment Securities Could Require Write-Downs, Which Would Reduce Earnings.\nRegulatory Matters Risks\n\u2022Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives May Affect Business Activities and Increase Operating Costs.\n\u2022Provisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Delaware Law, as Well as State and Federal Banking Regulations, Could Delay or Prevent a Takeover of Us by a Third Party.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates Risks\n\u2022Various Factors May Cause Our Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans to Increase.\n\u2022Fair Value Measurements May Be Affected by Inherent Uncertainties\nTrading of the Company's Common Stock\n\u2022The Trading History of the Company\u2019s Common Stock is Characterized By Low Trading Volume. The Value of Shareholder Investments May be Subject to Sudden Decreases Due to the Volatility of the Price of the Common Stock.\nLending\nDeterioration in the Housing Sector, Commercial Real Estate, and Related Markets May Adversely Affect Business and Financial Results.\nReal estate lending is a major business activity for the Company. Real estate market conditions affect the value and marketability of real estate collateral, and they also affect the cash flows, liquidity, and net worth of many borrowers whose operations and finances depend on real estate market conditions. Adverse conditions in the Company's market areas could reduce growth rates, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans, and generally affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Potential increases in interest rates could increase capitalization rates which could adversely affect commercial property appraisals and collateral value. Similarly, if residential mortgage interest rates increase from lows in recent years, residential property values may be adversely impacted. Pandemic impacts on the supply and demand of residential properties have caused unusual price appreciation in many markets, which may not be sustained if market conditions normalize.\nThe Company\u2019s Emphasis on Commercial Lending May Expose the Company to Increased Lending Risks, Which Could Hurt Profits.\nThe Company emphasizes commercial lending, which generally exposes the Company to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. Commercial loans are historically more susceptible to delinquency, default, and loss during economic downturns. Commercial lending involves larger loan sizes and larger relationship exposures, with greater\npotential impact on profits in the event of adverse loan performance. The majority of the Company\u2019s commercial loans are secured by real estate and subject to the previously discussed real estate risk factors, as well as risks specific to individual properties and property types. Geographic expansion may result in risks not previously experienced by the Company or which it is unfamiliar with monitoring or resolving. Recent expansion has been focused on the Greater Boston market, where the Bank may be financing projects with larger loan amounts where the Bank has less experience than in its traditional market areas and where competition may result in different lending structures. Recent expansion of the commercial lending team may expose the Company to new markets and risks if new lenders are not integrated with the Company\u2019s policies, controls, and procedures.\nCommercial lending activities pose higher risk of fraud. In 2019, the Company wrote-off the $16 million balance of a secured commercial loan in circumstances involving alleged borrower fraud. This asset was a participating interest in a commercial loan managed by another financial institution. Such participating interests involve risks related to counterparty performance, as further described in a later risk factor. In the case of this loan, the Company has filed legal claims against the agent bank in pursuit of the recovery of some of the loss recorded by the Company. The outcome of such legal proceedings is subject to uncertainty.\nThe Company is Subject to a Variety of Risks in Connection With Any Sale of Loans it May Conduct.\nThe Company routinely sells newly originated residential mortgage loans and SBA guaranteed business loans, and may also sell other loans or loans portfolios. It may make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser concerning the loans sold and the procedures under which those loans have been originated and serviced. If any of these representations and warranties are invalid, the Company may be required to refund premiums, indemnify the purchaser for any related costs or losses, or it may be required to repurchase part or all of the affected loans, which may be impaired. The Company may also be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default by the borrower on a loan it has sold. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain seller/servicer relationships with government agencies and government backed entities may be jeopardized in the event of the emergence of one or more of the above risks. Demand for the Company\u2019s loans in the secondary markets could also be affected by these risks, which could lead to a reduction in related business activities.\nThe Company may be required to reduce the value of any loans it marks as held for sale, which could adversely affect its results of operations. As a result of the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives, the Company sold certain loans which were previously held for investment and conducted sales with buyers who it had not previously transacted with.\nThe Company is Exposed to Risk of Environmental Liability When It Takes Title to Property.\nIn the course of its business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, the Company could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. The Company may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.\nNew Third Party Lending Relationships and Sourcing Channels May Increase Lending Risk.\nThe Company is expanding its lending sourcing channels, including forming a residential mortgage conduit, partnering with fintech online lenders, and expanding its commercial loan sourcing channels. It is also relying more on third party loan servicing. These activities may increase the underwriting risks and loan administration risks in managing its lending activities.\nOperating\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic is Adversely Affecting, and Will Likely Continue to Adversely Affect, the Company\u2019s Business, Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Results of Operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the U.S. and global economy; disrupted U.S. and global supply chains and labor markets; created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets; impacted rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities; resulted in increased credit risk in certain industries; increased demands on capital and liquidity; and affected employment and consumer confidence. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures and curtailment of individual and business activities in our footprint. The pandemic has caused us, and could continue to cause us, increases in the Company's allowance for credit losses and subsequent increases in credit losses in our loan portfolios. Some of the risks the Company faces from the pandemic include, but are not limited to: the health and availability of our colleagues, the supply of labor, inflationary impacts on operating costs, the financial condition of our clients and the demand for our products and services, changes in interest rates, recognition of credit losses and increases in the allowance for credit losses, impacts if customers draw on their lines of credit or draw down deposits or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses, and a significant deterioration of business conditions in our markets. Furthermore, the pandemic has caused us to recognize impairment of our goodwill and there could be impairment of our financial assets. Sustained adverse effects may also increase our cost of capital, prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, or result in downgrades in our credit rating. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the continued effectiveness of our business continuity plan, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, colleagues, counterparties and service providers, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nGovernmental authorities have taken significant measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth. The future impact of these measures is unknown, and they may not be sufficient to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic. We also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions.\nThe length of the pandemic and the effectiveness of the measures being put in place to address it are unknown. Until the effects of the pandemic subside, we face possible impacts on liquidity, operating revenues, and credit performance. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company is Subject to Security and Operational Risks Relating to the Use of Technology that Could Damage the Company's Reputation and Business.\nSecurity breaches of confidential information in our technology platforms could expose the Company to possible liability and damage its reputation. Any compromise of data security could also deter customers from using the Company's services. The Company relies on industry standard internet security and authentication systems to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect the Company's security systems from compromises or breaches and could result in damage to its reputation and business. The Company utilizes third party core banking software, in addition to other outsourced data processing. If third party providers encounter difficulties or if the Company has difficulty in communicating and/or transmitting with such third parties, it could significantly affect its ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which could significantly affect its business operations. The Company interfaces with electronic payments systems which are subject to security and operational risks. The Company utilizes file encryption in designated internal systems and networks and is subject to certain state and federal regulations regarding how the Company manages data security. The Company's enterprise governance risk and compliance function includes a framework of controls, policies and technologies to monitor and protect information from cyberattacks, mishandling, and loss, together with safeguards related to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Natural disasters and disaster recovery risks could affect its operating systems, which could affect its reputation. The Company's business continuity program addresses crisis\nmanagement, business impact, and data and systems recovery. Potential problems with the management of technology security and operational risks may affect regulatory compliance, which could affect operating costs and expansion plans.\nThe Company Faces Cybersecurity Risks, Including Denial of Service Attacks, Ransomware, Hacking and Identity Theft that Could Result in the Disclosure of Confidential Information or the Creation of Unauthorized Transactions, Which Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business or Reputation and Create Significant Legal and Financial Exposure.\nBanking institutions face increased cybersecurity risks due to the number of employees that are working remotely in regions impacted by stay-at-home orders. Increased levels of remote access create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities, and employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts due to work responsibilities at home. In addition, technological resources may be strained due to the number of remote users. Banking institutions should evaluate their cybersecurity risks in light of these issues and update their existing risk factors for any material changes or developments\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, steal financial assets, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions. As a growing regional bank, the Company may be subject to similar attacks in the future. Hacking and identity theft risks could cause serious reputational harm and possible financial loss to the Company. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and the Company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks.\nThe Company may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, the Company will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, and the Company may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against such security breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients or to conduct unauthorized financial transactions.\nThese risks may increase in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause serious negative consequences to the Company, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Company or those of its customers and counterparties. A security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nCounterparties and Correspondents Expose the Company to Risks.\nThe Company's use of derivative financial instruments exposes us to financial and contractual risks with counterparties. The Company maintains correspondent bank relationships, manage certain loan participations, engage in securities and funding transactions, and undergo other activities with financial counterparties that are customary to its industry. The Company also utilizes services from major vendors of technology, telecommunications, and other essential operating services. There is financial, reputational, and operational risk in these relationships, which the Company seeks to manage through internal controls and procedures, but there are no assurances that the Company will not experience loss or interruption of its business as a result of unforeseen events with these providers. The Company's mortgage banking operations have exposed us to counterparty transactions including the use of third parties to participate in the management of interest rate risk and mortgage sales and\nhedging. Financial, reputational, and operational risks are inherent in these counterparty and correspondent relationships. The Company could experience losses if there are failures in the controls or accounting, including those related to derivatives activities or if there are performance failures by any counterparties. The risk of loss is increased when interest rates change suddenly and if the intended hedging objectives are not achieved as a result of market or counterparty behaviors.\nThe Company\u2019s Business is Reliant on Outside Vendors.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly dependent on the use of certain outside vendors for its day-to-day operations. The Company\u2019s operations and reputation are exposed to risk that a vendor may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in its agreements for any number of reasons including a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or a simple change in their strategic focus. While the Company has comprehensive programs, policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of vendor management from selection, to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a vendor to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, strategic objectives, and results of operations.\nDevelopment of New Products and Services May Impose Additional Costs on the Company and May Expose It to Increased Operational Risk.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate its products or provide cost efficiencies, while avoiding increased related expenses. This dependency is exacerbated in the current \u201cFinTech\u201d environment, where financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies, such as \u201cBlockchain,\u201d and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards. The introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources, including regulatory approvals. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including technical and control requirements that may need to be developed and implemented, rapid technological change in the industry, the Company\u2019s ability to access technical and other information from its clients, the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices and the preparation of marketing, sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and its underlying risks. The Company\u2019s failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes it to enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. Regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to the Company\u2019s clients. Products and services relying on internet and mobile technologies may expose the Company to fraud and cybersecurity risks. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and reputation, as well as on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Discontinuation of LIBOR and the Emergence of One or More Alternative Benchmark Indices to Replace LIBOR Could Adversely Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Results of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the Company\u2019s products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or to an index, currency, basket or other financial metric. Pursuant to regulations, the use of LIBOR on new contracts was discontinued on December 31, 2021, and LIBOR will cease publication after June 30, 2023.\nRegulators and various financial industry groups have sponsored or formed committees (e.g., the Federal Reserve-sponsored Alternative Reference Rates Committee) to, among other things, facilitate the identification of an alternative benchmark index to replace LIBOR, and publish consultations on recommended practices for transitioning away from LIBOR, including (i) the utilization of recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, and (ii) development of alternative pricing methodologies for recommended alternative benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-based\nrepurchase transactions. At this time, it is still not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted in the market, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. The Company has adopted SOFR as its preferred benchmark as an alternative to LIBOR for use in new contracts beginning on January 1, 2022.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR could result in changes to the Company\u2019s risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, the Company\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the Company has issued or owns. A substantial portion of the Company\u2019s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments are indexed to LIBOR, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. In addition, such uncertainty could result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's Wholesale Funding Sources May Prove Insufficient to Replace Deposits at Maturity and Support Operations and Future Growth.\nThe Company must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of its liquidity management, the Company uses a number of funding sources in addition to deposit growth and cash flows from loans and investments. These sources include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, and liquidity resources at the holding company. The Company uses brokered deposits both to support ongoing growth and to provide enhanced deposit insurance to support large dollar commercial relationships. The Company's financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the Company is unable to maintain access to wholesale funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable costs. Turbulence in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with the Company.\nThe Company's Ability to Service Our Debt, Pay Dividends, and Otherwise Pay Obligations as They Come Due Is Substantially Dependent on Capital Distributions from the Bank, and These Distributions Are Subject to Regulatory Limits and Other Restrictions. The Company\u2019s Stock Repurchase Program is also Dependent on These Distributions.\nA substantial source of holding company income is the receipt of dividends from the Bank, from which the Company services debt, pay obligations, and pay shareholder dividends. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the applicable regulatory authorities could assert that payment of dividends or other types of payments are an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends, the Company may not be able to service debt, pay debt obligations, or pay dividends on its common stock. The Company may also be unable to repurchase common stock under its Stock Repurchase Program.\nThe Loss Recorded in 2020 May Have an Adverse Effect on Future Dividend Payments to Common Shareholders.\nDue to the loss in the first half of 2020 and its impact on retained earnings, the Bank requires approval from the Massachusetts Division of Banks in order to continue to be a source of dividend income to the Company. Over the long term, these dividends are a source of funds to the parent to support dividend payments to Company shareholders. Also due to the loss, the Company requires nonobjection from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for future shareholder dividend payments. Future payments of dividends will also depend on the Board\u2019s holistic assessment of the Company\u2019s operating, risk, and financial situations and current circumstances, as well as regulatory assessments of these factors.\nSecondary Mortgage Market Conditions Could Have a Material Impact on the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and increased investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may\nfluctuate or worsen in the future. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce the Company\u2019s loan production volumes and operating results.\nSecondary markets are significantly affected by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) for loan purchases that meet their conforming loan requirements. These agencies could limit purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints, a change in the criteria for conforming loans or other factors. Proposals to reform mortgage finance could affect the role of the Agencies and the market for conforming loans which comprise the majority of the Company\u2019s mortgage lending and related originations income.\nInterest Rates\nMarket Interest Rate Conditions Could Adversely Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nNet interest income is the Company's largest source of income. Changes in interest rates can affect the level of net interest income and other elements of net income. The Company\u2019s interest rate sensitivity is discussed in more detail in Item 7A of this report and is the primary market risk to its condition and operations. Changes in interest rates can also affect the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and the supply conditions in the U.S. financial and capital markets. Changes in the level of interest rates may negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate real estate loans, the value of its assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale of assets, all of which ultimately affect earnings. Changes in interest rates may also affect the market value of the Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio, which may affect the level and adequate of its regulatory capital. The Federal Open Market Committee has indicated that it plans to increase interest rates in 2022.\nSecurities Market Values\nDeclines in the Value of Certain Investment Securities Could Require Write-Downs, Which Would Reduce Earnings.\nDeclines in the value of investment securities due to market conditions and/or issuer impairment could result in losses that can reduce capital and earnings. The Company\u2019s investment in equity securities and non-investment grade debt securities present heightened credit and price risks. Under new accounting standards, equity gains and losses are recorded to current period operating results. The Company has an investment in the stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (\"FHLBB\") which could result in write-down in the event of impairment.\nRegulatory Matters\nLegislative and Regulatory Initiatives May Affect Business Activities and Increase Operating Costs.\nNew federal or state laws and regulations could affect lending, funding practices, capital, and liquidity standards. New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes may also increase compliance costs and affect business and operations. Moreover, the FDIC sets the cost of FDIC insurance premiums, which can affect profitability.\nRegulatory capital requirements and their impact on the Company may change. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to support operations and continued growth. The Company's ability to raise capital, if needed, will depend on its condition and performance, and on market conditions.\nNew laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which the Company does business, the markets for and value of its loans and investments, and ongoing operations, costs and profitability. For more information, see \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nWith total assets over $10 billion, the Company and the Bank are subject to closer supervision by their primary regulators and, as to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Company and the Bank are subject to capital stress testing expectations which require significant resources and infrastructure. If the Company\u2019s compliance with the enhanced supervision and requirements is insufficient, there can be significant negative consequences for its operations, profitability, and ability to further pursue its strategic growth plan.\nProvisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Delaware Law, as Well as State and Federal Banking Regulations, Could Delay or Prevent a Takeover of Us by a Third Party.\nProvisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Delaware, and state and federal regulations could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of its common stock. These provisions include: limitations on voting rights of beneficial owners of more than 10 percent of common stock; supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations; the election of directors to terms of one year; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Company's Board of Directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings. In addition, the Company is subject to Delaware laws, including one that prohibits engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for the Company's common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, its common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the Board.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates\nVarious Factors May Cause our Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans to Increase.\nThe Company has an allowance for current expected credit losses on loans maintained through a provision for credit losses charged to expense. This represents our estimate of current expected credit losses based on an evaluation of risks within the portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance represents management\u2019s estimate of current expected credit losses over the contractual life of the existing loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, all of which may undergo frequent and material changes. Changes in economic and other conditions affecting borrowers, along with new information regarding existing loans other factors, may indicate the need for a future increase in the allowance.\nFair Value Measurements May Be Affected by Inherent Uncertainties\nThe Company uses fair value measurements to determine fair value disclosures and to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities, such as interest rate swaps, impaired loans, securities available for sale, and derivatives. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as certain impaired loans held for investment and capitalized servicing rights. Whenever there is no readily available market data, management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements.\nTrading of the Company's Common Stock\nThe Trading History of the Company\u2019s Common Stock is Characterized By Low Trading Volume. The Value of Shareholder Investments May be Subject to Sudden Decreases Due to the Volatility of the Price of the Common Stock.\nThe level of interest and trading in the Company\u2019s stock depends on many factors beyond the Company's control. The market price of the Company's common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following: actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results; changes in interest rates; changes in the legal or regulatory environment; press releases, announcements or publicity relating to the Company or its competitors or relating to trends in its industry; changes in expectations as to future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors; future sales of its common stock; changes in economic conditions in the marketplace, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and other developments. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of the Company's common stock, regardless of actual operating performance, and could prevent stockholders from selling their common stock at a desirable price.\nIn the past, stockholders have brought securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. The Company could be the target of similar litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.", "PERMNO": 88280, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BHLB"}
