RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. There are risks, many beyond our control, that could cause our financial condition or results of operations to differ materially from management\u2019s expectations. Some of the risks that may affect us are described below. If any of the following risks, by itself or together with one or more other factors, actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. These risks are not the only risks that we may face. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the United States, as well as other risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained herein constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 51.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe may not be able to adequately measure and limit our credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, which could lead to unexpected losses.\nThe business of lending is inherently risky, including risks that the principal of or interest on any loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting the loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower\u2019s business sector and local, regional and national market, and economic conditions. Our risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific industries and our credit approval practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. Finally, many of our loans are made to middle-market businesses that may be less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management\u2019s judgment of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of historical default and loss experience in our portfolio, general economic conditions, diversification and seasoning of the loan portfolio, identified credit problems, delinquency levels and adequacy of collateral. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is inherently highly subjective and requires us to make significant estimates of and assumptions regarding current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Inaccurate management assumptions, deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their periodic examination, review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and may direct us to make additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the allowance for loan losses, we may need additional provision for loan losses to restore the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nA material portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans secured by equipment or other business assets, the deterioration in value of which could increase our exposure to future probable losses.\nHistorically, a material portion of our loans held-for-investment have been comprised of commercial loans to businesses collateralized by general business assets including, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. These commercial and industrial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis. Historically, losses in our commercial and industrial credits have been higher than losses in other segments of our loan portfolio. Significant adverse changes in various industries could cause rapid declines in values and collectability associated with those business assets resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose us to future losses. An increase in specific reserves and charge-offs related to our commercial and industrial loan portfolio could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding commercial and industrial loans of $587.4 million, or 17.3% of our loans held-for-investment.\nBecause many of our customers are commercial enterprises, they may be adversely affected by any decline in general economic conditions in the United States which, in turn, could have a negative impact on our business.\nMany of our customers are commercial enterprises whose business and financial condition are sensitive to changes in the general economy of the United States. Our businesses and operations are, in turn, sensitive to these same general economic conditions. If the U.S. experiences a deterioration of economic conditions, or other significant volatility in economic conditions, our growth and profitability could be constrained. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries, including uncertainty over the stability of the euro currency and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could negatively affect U.S. economic conditions. Weak economic conditions are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, lack of liquidity and depressed prices in the secondary market for loans, increased delinquencies on loans, real estate price declines, and lower commercial activity. All of these factors are detrimental to the business and/or financial position of our customers as well as the value of the collateral supporting our loans and could adversely impact demand for our credit products as well as our credit quality. Our business is also sensitive to monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control and difficult to predict. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to credit risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties, as well as real estate construction and development loans. As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding loans secured by non-owner-occupied commercial properties of $948.8 million, or 27.9%, of our loans held-for-investment. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans are typically more difficult to liquidate. Additionally, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio could require us to increase our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe make loans to businesses backed by private equity firms, including those through participation interests. These loan relationships may have repayment and other characteristics that are different than those of traditional business loans, which could have an adverse effect on our asset quality and profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $70.0 million in loans to private equity backed businesses, which represented 2.1% of our loans held-for-investment compared to $131.7 million, or 4.6%, as of December 31, 2015. These loan relationships may have repayment characteristics that are different than those of our traditional, owner-operated businesses. These loans often are for purposes of financing private equity groups\u2019 acquisitions of companies that become our borrowers. Acquisition-related loans are generally secured by all business assets, but often have a weaker secondary source of repayment resulting in greater reliance upon the cash flow generated by the borrower for repayment, which may be unpredictable. Because private equity groups acquire businesses primarily for financial interests, they may behave differently than our other commercial borrowers. Of these loans to private equity backed businesses as of December 31, 2016, $42.8 million, or 1.3% of our loans held-for-investment, were SNC loans in which we were not the lead bank compared to $58.3 million, or 2.1%, as of December 31, 2015. In certain circumstances, our lending through participation loans in which we are not the agent bank to private equity backed businesses can present additional risks because the agent bank or bank group may make different decisions or otherwise may not be able to respond as a group as quickly or as definitively as we might on our own in the event that a private equity backed borrower becomes financially or operationally challenged. The different characteristics of this segment of our loan portfolio could negatively impact our profitability or asset quality, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and future prospects. We have over the past several years substantially decreased, the balance of these loans and the percentage of our total loans they represent. We intend to continue reducing the portion of our loan portfolio consisting of private equity backed SNC loans in large part by further diversifying through growth in loans from our private banking channel and direct and/or non-private equity backed commercial loans. However, there can be no guaranty we will be successful in our efforts to further diversify the portfolio.\nOur private banking business could be negatively impacted by a prolonged downturn in the securities markets.\nMarketable-securities-backed private banking loans represent a material portion of our business and are the fastest growing part of our loan portfolio. We expect to continue to increase the percentage of our loan portfolio represented by marketable-securities-backed private banking loans in the future. We believe our risk management practices are designed to appropriately mitigate the risk of fluctuations in\nthe market value of securities that collateralize these loans. We also believe that our success in expanding our financial intermediary referral network will enable growth in this line of business in various securities market environments. Nevertheless, a sharp or prolonged decline in the value of the collateral that secures these loans could materially adversely affect the growth prospects or loan performance in this segment of our loan portfolio and, as a result, could materially adversely affect our business. As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding marketable-securities-backed private banking loans of $1.58 billion, or 46.6% of our loans held-for-investment.\nA prolonged downturn in the real estate market, especially in our primary markets, could result in losses and adversely affect our profitability.\nHistorically, a material portion of our loans have been comprised of loans with real estate as a primary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. The U.S. recession from 2007 to 2009 adversely affected real estate market values across the country, including in our primary market areas. A general decline in real estate values, particularly in our primary market areas, could impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon any foreclosure, which would likely require us to increase our provision for loan losses. In the event of a default with respect to any of these loans, the amount we receive upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. If we are required to re-value the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses, our profitability could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nA material portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of participation transaction interests, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to monitor and/or manage the lending relationships and lead to an increased risk of loss.\nWe achieved a significant portion of our loan growth and diversity in our loan portfolio in our initial years of operation by participating in loans originated by other institutions (including shared national credits) in which other lenders serve as the agent bank. This SNC structure may reduce our control over the monitoring and management of these relationships, particularly participations with large bank groups, which could lead to increased risk of loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. As a result, we have reduced this component of our loan portfolio and we intend to continue to further diversify our portfolio through growth in loans from our private banking channel and direct commercial loans. However, there can be no guaranty we will be successful in our efforts to further diversify the portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, $344.0 million, or 10.1% of our loans held-for-investment, consisted of SNC loans in which we were not the lead bank.\nOur loan portfolio contains large loans, and deterioration in the financial condition of these large loans could have a material adverse impact on our asset quality and profitability.\nIf only a few of our largest borrowers become unable to repay their loan obligations as a result of economic or market conditions or personal circumstances, our non-performing loans and our provision for loan losses could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. We intend to continue to further diversify our portfolio with increased focus on growth in loans from our private banking channel and direct commercial loans which often have smaller loan balances. However, there can be no guaranty we will be successful in our efforts to further diversify the portfolio.\nOur lending limit may restrict our growth and prevent us from effectively implementing our business strategy.\nWe are limited in the amount we can loan to a single borrower by the amount of our capital. Generally, under current law, we may lend up to 15.0% of our unimpaired capital and surplus to any one borrower. We have also established an informal limit on loans to any one borrower of $10.0 million. Based upon our current capital levels, the amount we may lend is significantly less than that of many of our competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our lending limit from doing business with us. We accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy may not always be available. If we are unable to compete effectively for loans from our target customers, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe must maintain and follow high loan underwriting standards to grow safely.\nOur ability to grow our assets safely depends on maintaining disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensuring that our relationship managers and lending personnel follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as to seek higher yielding loans, or a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, any of which could adversely affect our net income. Relatedly, as we attempt to uphold those standards in an increasingly competitive lending environment, we may experience increased refinancing of existing loans and reduced new loan growth. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition or future prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe rely heavily on our executive management team and other key employees, and we could be adversely affected by the unexpected loss of their services.\nOur success depends in large part on the performance of our key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business plan may be lengthy. We currently do not have any employment or non-compete agreements with any of our executive officers or key employees other than certain non-solicitation and restrictive agreements that we received from certain key employees in connection with our investment management business. We may not be successful in retaining our key employees, and the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our primary markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. If the services of any of our key personnel should become unavailable for any reason, we may not be able to identify and hire qualified persons on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur business has grown rapidly, and we may not be able to maintain our historical rate of growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur business has grown rapidly. Although rapid business growth can be a favorable business condition, financial institutions that grow rapidly can experience significant difficulties as a result of rapid growth. We seek to grow safely and consistently. This requires us to manage several different elements simultaneously. Successful growth in our banking business requires that we follow adequate loan underwriting standards, balance loan and deposit growth without increasing interest rate risk or compressing our net interest margin, maintain adequate capital at all times, produce investment performance results competitive with our peers and benchmarks, further diversify our revenue sources, meet the expectations of our clients, and hire and retain qualified employees. If we do not manage our growth successfully, then our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or continue to grow our business at all. Because of factors such as the uncertainty in the general economy and the recent government intervention in the credit markets, it may be difficult for us to repeat our historic earnings growth as we continue to expand. Failure to grow or failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur utilization of brokered deposits could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nSince our inception, we have utilized both brokered and non-brokered deposits as a source of funds to support our growing loan demand and other liquidity needs. As a bank regulatory supervisory matter, reliance upon brokered deposits as a significant source of funding is discouraged. Brokered deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits and, in the future, those depositors may not renew their deposits when they mature, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to keep those deposits or may have to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources. Additionally, if TriState Capital Bank ceases to be categorized as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes, it will not be able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits without a waiver from the FDIC. Our inability to maintain or replace these brokered deposits as they mature could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Further, paying higher interest rates to maintain or replace these deposits could adversely affect our net interest margin and our results of operations or financial condition.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy will depend on our liquidity and ability to obtain funding for loan originations, working capital and other general purposes. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our preferred source of funds for our banking business consists of customer deposits; however, we rely on other sources such as brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) advances. In addition to our competition with other banks for deposits, such account and deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return trade off. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we may increase our utilization of brokered deposits, FHLB advances and other wholesale funding sources necessary to fund desired growth levels.\nWe rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities and other sources of liquidity, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our banking operations. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to fund new loan balances, invest in securities, meet our expenses or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk that could negatively impact the profitability of our banking business.\nOur profitability, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a significant extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. One of the ways in which we attempt to manage interest rate risk is by maintaining a largely asset sensitive balance sheet combined with longer-term deposits, but conditions could prevent us from successfully implementing this strategy in the future.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of our assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore net income, could be adversely affected.\nOur loans are predominantly variable rate loans, with the majority being based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). While there is a low probability that interest rates will decline materially from current levels, a continuation of the current levels of historically low interest rates could cause the spread between our loan yields and our deposit rates paid to compress our net interest margin and our net income could be adversely affected. Further, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nFurther, short-term interest rates are currently very low by historical standards. These low rates have reduced our cost of funding over time. We do not believe that we can continue to use these low rates to reduce our cost of funding by the levels we have in past years. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition or future prospects may be adversely affected, perhaps materially.\nIn addition, an increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also necessitate increases to our allowance for loan losses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nProlonged lower interest rates may adversely affect our net income.\nProlonged lower interest rates may have an adverse impact on the composition of our earning assets, our net interest margin, our net interest income and our net income. Among other things, in addition to the Interest Rate Risk listed above, a period of prolonged lower rates may cause prepayments to increase as our banking clients seek to refinance loans they currently have with us, as well as cause new originations to reflect the lower interest rate environment. Such prepayment, refinancing and new origination activity can result in a decrease in the weighted average yield of our earning assets. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected, perhaps materially.\nChanges in the method of determining the LIBOR or other reference rates may adversely impact the value of loans and other financial instruments we hold that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates in ways that are difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn recent years, concerns have been raised about the accuracy of the calculation of LIBOR. Aspects of the method for determining how LIBOR is formulated and its use in the market have changed and may continue to change. Recent changes to LIBOR administration have included the introduction of statutory regulation of LIBOR by U.K. regulatory authorities; reducing the currencies for which LIBOR is calculated to five; reducing the tenors for which LIBOR is calculated to seven; delaying the publication of individual banks\u2019 LIBOR submissions for three months from submission; and requiring banks to provide LIBOR submissions based on an effective methodology on the basis of relevant criteria and information, including observable market transactions where possible. Each such change and any future changes could impact the availability and volatility of LIBOR. Similar changes have occurred or may occur with respect to other reference rates. It is not currently possible to determine whether, or to what extent, any such changes would impact the value of any loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit we hold or that are due to us, that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates, or whether, or to what extent, such changes would impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur commercial banking business is concentrated in, and largely dependent upon, the continued growth and welfare of the general geographic markets in which we operate.\nOur commercial banking operations are concentrated in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows are affected by changes in the economic conditions of any of those states or the regions of which they are a part. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and\nreal estate activity in these markets. Among other things, shale gas exploration and production is a significant force in driving the economies of Western Pennsylvania and Northeastern Ohio, two of our significant commercial banking markets, and low energy prices have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact shale gas exploration and production, negatively impacting those economies. Although we do not make loans to companies directly engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, adverse conditions that affect these market areas could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans, affect the value of collateral underlying loans, impact our ability to attract deposits and generally affect our financial conditions and results of operations. Because of our geographic concentration, we may be less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets.\nOur investment management business may be negatively impacted by competition, changes in economic and market conditions, changes in interest rates and investment performance.\nOur investment management business may be negatively impacted by competition, changes in economic and market conditions, changes in interest rates and investment performance. A material portion of our earnings is derived from Chartwell, our investment management business. The investment management business is intensely competitive. In the markets where we compete, there are over 1,000 firms which we consider to be primary competitors. In addition to competition from other institutional investment management firms, Chartwell, along with the active-management industry in general, compete with passive index funds, ETFs and investment alternatives such as hedge funds. Our ability to successfully attract and retain investment management clients will depend on, among other things, our ability to compete with our competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, fees, client services, marketing and distribution capabilities. Our ability to retain investment management clients may be impaired by the fact that investment management contracts are typically terminable in nature. Most of our clients may withdraw funds from under our management at their discretion at any time for any reason, including the performance of the investment advice, a change in the client\u2019s investment strategy or other factors. If we cannot effectively compete to attract and retain customers, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, it is possible our management fees could be reduced for a variety of reasons, including among other things, pressure on them resulting from competition in the investment management sector or regulatory changes, and that we may from time to time reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services offered as part of the our investment management business for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. If our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income from our investment management business would be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur investment management business may be negatively impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions. The financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry are highly volatile (meaning that performance results can vary greatly within short periods of time) and are directly affected by, among other factors, domestic and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance, all of which are beyond our control. We cannot guaranty that broad market performance will be favorable in the future. Declines in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may result in declines in the performance of the investment management business and the level of assets under management. Because the revenues of our investment management business are, to a large extent, fees based on assets under management, such declines could have a material adverse effect on that business.\nFurther, changes in interest rates could also adversely affect our investment management business, which will comprise a material part of our earnings, by decreasing the net asset values of our assets under management and potentially causing investors to shift assets in ways that negatively impact the fees generated by that business.\nThe termination or failure to renew fund agreements could have adverse effects on our investment management business.\nA material portion of our earnings is derived from investment management agreements and sub-advisor investment management agreements related to multiple sponsored funds. Investment management agreements are, as required by law, terminable upon 60 days\u2019 notice. In addition, investment management agreements of this nature must be approved and renewed annually by each fund\u2019s board of directors or trustees, including independent members of the board, or its shareholders, as required by law. Failure to renew, changes resulting in lower fees, or termination of a significant number of these agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur investment management business may be negatively impacted by our investment performance.\nSuccess in the investment management business is largely dependent on investment performance relative to market conditions and the performance of competing products. Good performance generally assists retention and growth of managed assets, resulting in additional revenues. Conversely, poor performance tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in revenues to the investment management business. It also could adversely impact any performance-based fees for which we are eligible in that business. Poor performance could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or business prospects. A significant and prolonged decline in the assets under management of our investment management business could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our future revenues and, to a lesser extent, net income due to related reductions to distribution expenses associated with these funds.\nThe failure or negative performance of products offered by other investment management companies may adversely impact our investment management business irrespective of that business\u2019 performance.\nMany competitors offer similar products to those offered by Chartwell and the failure or negative performance of competitors\u2019 products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar Chartwell products, irrespective of the performance of such products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the assets under management, revenue and earnings of our investment management business to decline.\nWe face significant competitive pressures that could impair our growth, decrease our profitability or reduce our market share.\nWe operate in the highly competitive financial services industry and face significant competition for customers from bank and non-bank competitors, particularly regional and nationwide institutions, in originating loans, attracting deposits, providing financial management products and services, and providing other financial services. Our competitors are generally larger and may have significantly more resources, greater name recognition, and more extensive and established branch networks or geographic footprints than we do. Because of their scale, many of these competitors can be more aggressive than we can on loan, deposit and financial services pricing. In addition, many of our non-bank and non-institutional financial management competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. We expect competition to continue to intensify due to financial institution consolidation; legislative, regulatory and technological changes; and the emergence of alternative banking sources and investment management products and services. Additionally, technology has lowered barriers to entry.\nOur ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nour ability to build and maintain long-term customer relationships while ensuring high ethical standards and safe and sound business practices;\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance, performance and pricing of products and services that we offer;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our products and services;\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends; and\n\u2022\nour ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology.\nIncreased competition could require us to increase the rates we pay on deposits or lower the rates we offer on loans or fees we charge on banking or investment management products and services, which could reduce our profitability. Our failure to compete effectively in our primary markets could cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business.\nOur business plan emphasizes building and maintaining strong relationships with our clients. We have benefited from strong relationships with and among our customers, and also from our relationships with financial intermediaries. As a result, our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business.\nOur growth over the past several years has depended on attracting new customers from competing financial institutions and increasing our market share, primarily by the involvement in our primary markets and word-of-mouth advertising, rather than on growth in the market for financial services in our primary markets. As such, we strive to enhance our reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities and markets that we serve and delivering superior service to our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our existing relationships may be damaged. We could lose some of our existing customers, including groups of large customers who have relationships with each other, and we may not be successful in attracting new customers. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nDeterioration in the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government and downgrades in U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities could adversely affect us and our banking operations.\nThe business environment in the markets in which we operate and in the United States as a whole have a significant effect on our financial performance, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay the principal of outstanding loans, the value of collateral securing those loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer and whose success we rely on to drive our future growth. Some elements of the business environment that affect our financial performance include short-term and long-term interest rates, the prevailing yield curve, inflation, monetary supply, fluctuations in the debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the domestic economy and the local economies in the markets in which we operate. Unfavorable market conditions can result in a deterioration of the credit quality of borrowers, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, additional provisions for loan losses, adverse asset values and a reduction in assets under management. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability of or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation, changes in interest rates, high unemployment, natural disasters, state or local government insolvency, or a combination of these or other factors.\nUncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. Any unfavorable change in the general business environment in which we operate, in the United States as a whole or abroad could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or future prospects.\nThe long-term outlook for the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government is uncertain, as illustrated by the 2011 downgrade by certain rating agencies of the credit rating of the U.S. federal government. In addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, any future downgrade, failures to raise the U.S. statutory debt limit, or deterioration in the fiscal outlook of the U.S. federal government, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities that we may hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. It also could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money markets, and long-term or short-term fixed income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect our profitability. The adverse consequences of any downgrade could also extend to those to whom we extend credit and could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans. In addition, any resulting decline in the financial markets could affect the value of marketable securities that serve as collateral for our loans, which would, in turn, adversely affect our credit quality and could impede the growth that we expect to achieve within this segment of our loan portfolio. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nWe hold an investment securities portfolio. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect to the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary often requires complex, subjective judgments about whether there has been a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer, whether management has the intent or ability to hold a security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security, and other relevant factors.\nAny future reductions in our credit ratings may increase our funding costs or impair our ability to effectively compete for business and clients.\nWe have used and may in the future use debt as a funding source. One or more rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long-term debt based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix and level and quality of earnings, and we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Our ratings remain subject to change at any time, and it is possible that any rating agency will take action to downgrade us in the future.\nAny future decrease in our credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could impact our access to the capital markets or short-term funding or increase our financing costs, and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. Our clients and counterparties may also be sensitive to the risks posed by a ratings downgrade and may terminate their relationships with us, may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in transactions with us at a substantially higher cost. We cannot predict whether client relationships or opportunities for future relationships could be adversely affected by clients who choose to do business with a higher-\nrated institution. The inability to retain clients or to effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAdditionally, rating agencies have themselves been subject to scrutiny arising from the financial crisis such that the rating agencies may make or may be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices. Such changes may, among other things, adversely affect the ratings of our securities or other securities in which we have an economic interest.\nOur financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and with general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amount of related revenues and expenses. Certain accounting policies inherently are based to a greater extent on estimates, assumptions and judgments of management and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. They require management to make subjective or complex judgments, estimates or assumptions, and changes in those estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. These critical accounting policies include: the allowance for loan losses, accounting for investment securities, evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets, accounting for income taxes and the determination of fair value for financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to significantly increase the allowance for loan losses or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided, significantly increase our accrued tax liability or otherwise incur charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nBy engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to additional credit and market risk in our banking business.\nWe use interest rate swaps to help manage our interest rate risk in our banking business from recorded financial assets and liabilities when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated asset or liability and the asset or liability exposes us to interest rate risk or risks inherent in customer related derivatives. We use other derivative financial instruments to help manage other economic risks, such as liquidity and credit risk, including exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash receipts principally related to certain of our fixed-rate loan assets or certain of our variable-rate borrowings. We also have derivatives that result from a service we provide to certain qualifying customers approved through our credit process, and therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in our assets or liabilities. Hedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and routine monitoring, and is not a perfect science. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk exists to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. Market risk exists to the extent that interest rates change in ways that are significantly different from what we expected when we entered into the derivative transaction. The existence of credit and market risk associated with our derivative instruments could adversely affect our net interest income and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe may be adversely affected by a decrease in the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker/dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other financial intermediaries. In addition, we participate in loans originated by other financial institutions (including shared national credits) in which other lenders serve as the lead bank. Further, our private banking channel relies on relationships with a number of other financial institutions for referrals. As a result, declines in the financial condition of, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, financial service companies or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity, asset quality or other problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. These problems, losses or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure, and a failure of these parties to perform for any reason could disrupt our operations.\nThird parties provide key components of our business infrastructure such as loan and account servicing, data processing, internet connections, network access, core application processing, statement production and account analysis. Our business depends on the\nsuccessful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. Replacing vendors or addressing other issues with our third-party service providers could entail significant delay and expense. If we are unable to efficiently replace ineffective service providers, or if we experience a significant, sustained or repeated, system failure or service denial, it could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business or financial damages from customer businesses, and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe utilize the information systems of third parties to monitor the value of and control marketable securities that collateralize our loans, and a failure of those systems or third parties could adversely affect our ability to assess and manage the risk in our loan portfolio.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by marketable securities that are held by third-party custodians or other financial services or wealth management firms. We utilize the systems of these third parties to provide information to us so that we can quickly and accurately monitor changes in the value of the securities that serve as collateral. We also rely on these parties to provide control over marketable securities for purposes of perfecting our security interests and retaining the collateral in the applicable accounts. While we have been careful in selecting the third-parties with which we do business, we do not control their actions, their systems or the information that they provide to us. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their failure to provide services or information to us for any reason, or their performing services poorly or providing us with incorrect information, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or could adversely affect our ability to manage, appropriately assess and react to risk in our loan portfolio, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe could be subject to losses, regulatory action or reputational harm due to fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, our borrowers, our clients, our employees and vendors.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements, property appraisals, title information, employment and income documentation, account information and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of such information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Any such misrepresentation or incorrect or incomplete information may not be detected prior to funding a loan or during our ongoing monitoring of outstanding loans. In addition, one or more of our employees or vendors could cause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our loan documentation, operations or systems. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur growth and expansion strategy may involve strategic investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to overcome risks associated with such transactions.\nAlthough we plan to continue to grow our business organically, we may seek opportunities to invest in or acquire investment management businesses or other businesses that we believe would complement our existing business model. Any potential future investment or acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nincurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential investments or acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in our attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022\nthe limited experience of our management team in working together on certain acquisitions and related integration activities that could be undertaken;\n\u2022\nthe time, expense and difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel and standards, procedures and policies of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\nan inability to realize expected synergies or returns on investment;\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing banking business; and\n\u2022\na loss of key employees or key customers following an investment or acquisition.\nWe may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with pending or potential investments or acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance shareholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may develop, grow and/or acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. All service offerings, including current offerings and those which may be provided in the future may become more risky due to changes in economic, competitive and market conditions beyond our control.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nIn connection with our acquisitions we have generally recognized intangible assets including customer relationship intangible assets and goodwill in our consolidated statement of financial condition. We may not realize the value of these assets. Management performs an annual review of the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and periodic reviews of the carrying values of all other intangible assets to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that an impairment in value may have occurred. A variety of factors could cause the carrying value of an asset to become impaired. Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the asset would occur, resulting in a non-cash charge which would adversely affect our results of operations for the period.\nUnauthorized access, cyber-crime and other threats to data security may require significant resources, harm our reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nWe necessarily collect, use and hold personal and financial information concerning individuals and businesses with which we have a relationship. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks, rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to additional costs for protection or remediation and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with customer expectations, statutory and regulatory privacy, and other requirements. It is difficult or impossible to defend against every risk being posed by changing technologies, criminals or terrorists intent on committing cyber-crime and who are constantly developing new threats that despite our best efforts could result in a data breach. We could also experience a breach due to intentional or negligent conduct on the part of employees or other internal sources, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, or other causes. As a result of any of these threats, our customer accounts may become vulnerable to account takeover schemes, identity theft or cyber-fraud. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may also become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, and viruses and malware.\nA breach of our security or the security of our third party vendors that results in unauthorized access to our data, including personal and financial information of our customers, could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs, and reputational damage. In addition, our investment management business could be harmed by cyber incidents affecting issuers in which its customers\u2019 assets are invested. Any such breaches of security or cyber incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nSystems and technology.\nWe utilize software and related technologies throughout our business including proprietary systems and those provided by outside service providers. Our service providers and customers, and third parties on which such service providers and customers rely, also utilize software and related technologies in their businesses. Unanticipated issues could occur and it is not possible to predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure or the failure of a third party to address computer system or software problems. Data or model imprecision, software or other technology malfunctions, programming inaccuracies and similar or other circumstances or events may impair the performance of systems and technology. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that potential system interruptions, other\ntechnology-related issues or the cost necessary to rectify the problems would not have a material adverse effect on our business including, but not limited to, business prospects, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nWe may take filing positions or follow tax strategies that may be subject to challenge.\nThe amount of income taxes that we are required to pay on our earnings is based on federal and state legislation and regulations. We provide for current and deferred taxes in our financial statements based on our results of operations, business activity, legal structure and interpretation of tax statutes. We may take filing positions or follow tax strategies that are subject to audit and may be subject to challenge. Our net income may be reduced if a federal, state or local authority assessed charges for taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements. Taxing authorities could change applicable tax laws, challenge filing positions or assess taxes and interest charges. If taxing authorities take any of these actions, our business, results of operations, financial condition, could be adversely affected, perhaps materially.\nThe market in which we operate is susceptible to storms and other natural disasters and adverse weather which could result in a disruption of our operations and increases in loan losses.\nA significant portion of our business is generated from markets that have been, and may continue to be, damaged by major storms and other natural disasters and adverse weather. Natural disasters can disrupt our operations, cause widespread property damage, and severely depress the local economies in which we operate. If the economies in our primary markets experience an overall decline as a result of a natural disaster, adverse weather, or other disaster, demand for loans and our other products and services could be reduced. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses on loan portfolios may increase substantially, as uninsured property losses or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the loans could be materially and adversely affected by a disaster. A disaster could, therefore, result in decreased revenue and loan losses that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur operations and clients are concentrated in large metropolitan areas in the United States, which could be the target of terrorist attacks.\nA significant portion of our operations and our clients, as well as the properties securing our loans outstanding are located in large metropolitan areas in the United States. These areas have been and may continue to be the target of terrorist attacks. A successful, major terrorist attack in one of our primary markets could severely disrupt our operations and the ability of our clients to do business with us, and cause losses to loans secured by properties in these areas. Such an attack could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nIn the course of our business, we may purchase real estate, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Any significant environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nRisks Relating to Regulations\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, which could have a material and adverse impact on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans and future prospects.\nBanking is highly regulated under federal and state law. We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision that governs almost all aspects of our operations. As a registered bank holding company, we are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. As a commercial bank chartered under the laws of Pennsylvania, TriState Capital Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC. Our investment management business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States. Chartwell and Chartwell TSC are subject to Federal securities laws, principally the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment Company Act, the Advisers Act, state laws regarding securities fraud and regulations promulgated by various regulatory authorities, including the SEC, FINRA, applicable state laws and stock exchanges. Our investment management business also may be subject to regulation by the CFTC and NFA. The investment management business also is affected by the regulations governing banks and other financial institutions.\nThe primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. This system is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund and bank depositors, rather than our shareholders and creditors. The banking agencies have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks, including the authority, among other things, to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, require affirmative action to correct any violation or practice, issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced, direct increases in capital, direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets, limit dividends and distributions, restrict growth, assess civil monetary penalties, remove officers and directors and, with respect to banks, terminate our charter, terminate our deposit insurance or place the Bank into conservatorship or receivership. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations or unsafe or unsound practices.\nIn addition, to the safety and soundness focus, though, there are significant banking regulations relating to other aspects of our business, including borrower protection and community development. With respect to our community development obligations under the CRA, we have established an approved CRA strategic plan for the years 2015 through 2017. We are preparing to submit to the FDIC for approval the application for our updated strategic plan to cover the years 2018 through 2020. While we believe we will succeed in obtaining approval for our updated strategic plan, we cannot guaranty that we will obtain such an approval, in which case we would be subject to the CRA for traditional large banks, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial of operation, financial condition and future prospects. For additional information, see \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Community Reinvestment Act.\u201d\nThe securities industry, including the investment management segment of it, has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators, including the SEC, FINRA and state attorneys general. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years. We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations.\nEach of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including, but not limited to, the authority to fine us and to grant, cancel, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on the right to carry on particular businesses. We also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, other U.S. governmental regulatory authorities, FINRA or other self-regulatory organizations that supervise the banks and financial markets.\nCompliance with the myriad laws and regulations applicable to our organization can be difficult and costly. In addition, these laws, regulations and policies are subject to continual review by governmental authorities, and changes to these laws, regulations and policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of these laws, regulations and policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and often impose additional compliance costs. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations, such as the Dodd- Frank Act, could make compliance more difficult or expensive. All of these laws and regulations, and the supervisory framework applicable to our industry, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans and future prospects. In addition, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have adverse financial effects on us or cause reputational harm to us, which could harm our business prospects.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act comprehensively reformed the regulation of financial institutions, products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. While a significant number of regulations have already been promulgated to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for lengthy periods, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial services industry, generally and our company in particular. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that affect deposit insurance assessments, the payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees could increase the costs associated with TriState Capital Bank\u2019s deposit-generating activities, as well as place limitations on the revenues that those deposits may generate. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB. The CFPB has the authority to prescribe rules for all depository institutions governing the provision of consumer financial products and services, which may result in rules and regulations that reduce the profitability of such products and services or impose greater costs on us and our subsidiaries.\nIt is not clear whether the executive order issued on February 3, 2017, by President Trump calling for his administration to review existing U.S. financial laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act, or the memorandum issued by President Trump to the DOL regarding the fiduciary rule, will result in material changes to the current laws and rules, or those that are in process, applicable to financial institutions and financial services or products like ours. It also is not clear what the impact from any such changes would be on our business or the markets and industries in which we compete. There is no guaranty that any changes from this review would be positive for us, and any such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business and our prospects.\nFederal and state bank regulators periodically examine our business and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a bank regulatory agency were to determine that our financial\ncondition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate TriState Capital Bank\u2019s charter or deposit insurance and place the Bank into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nThe Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase.\nThe deposits of TriState Capital Bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject it to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The Bank\u2019s regular assessments are determined by its risk category, which is based on a combination of its financial ratios and supervisory ratings, which, among other things, generally demonstrates its regulatory capital levels and level of supervisory concern. High levels of bank failures since 2007 and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased costs to the FDIC in resolving bank failures and have put significant pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund, the FDIC increased deposit insurance assessment rates and charged a special assessment to all FDIC-insured financial institutions. In the third quarter of 2016, the FDIC published the final rule to modify the FDIC deposit insurance premium assessment methodology for banks under $10 billion, which resulted in a higher assessment for the Bank. Any revised deposit insurance premium assessment methodology resulting from this new rule may result in material increases to our FDIC deposit insurance premiums. Further increases in assessment rates or special assessments may occur in the future, especially if there are significant additional financial institution failures.\nRegulatory capital rules.\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee released a final framework for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as Basel III. In July 2013, final rules implementing the Basel III capital accord were adopted by the federal banking agencies. Basel III, which began phasing in on January 1, 2015, has replaced the existing regulatory capital rules for the Company and the Bank. The Basel III final rules required new minimum capital ratio standards, established a new common equity tier 1 to total risk-weighted assets ratio, subjected banking organizations to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, and established a new standardized approach for risk weightings. Basel III will be fully phased-in by 2019. The overall net impact of applying Basel III regulatory rules to the Company and TriState Capital Bank was beneficial and resulted in an increase to the risk-based capital ratios effective January 1, 2015, which primarily resulted from reduced risk-weighted capital treatment for certain of the Bank\u2019s private banking non-purpose margin loans, which are collateralized by liquid and marketable securities that are monitored daily.\nWe expect that the Company and the Bank will meet all minimum capital requirements and that the Company and the Bank would also meet all capital requirements as if fully phased in without material adverse effects on our business. However, if the capital rules continue to evolve over time or if our application of the capital rules is challenged or reversed, our business, operating performance or financial prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nLiquidity Requirements.\nHistorically, the regulation and monitoring of bank holding company and bank liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III liquidity framework requires bank holding companies and banks to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management or supervisory purposes, going forward will be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d), is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity\u2019s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon under a liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements will likely encourage banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and may increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. The liquidity rules released by applicable regulators do not apply to us because we are below $50 billion in assets and because we are not internationally active. However, it is possible that the federal banking agencies could apply an LCR requirement directly to banks such as our bank in the future, or that the FDIC could apply an LCR requirement to us as a supervisory matter.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department\nof Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports when appropriate. In addition to other bank regulatory agencies, the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the state and federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury regarding, among other things, the prohibition of transacting business with, and the need to freeze assets of, certain persons and organizations identified as a threat to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including any acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe are a holding company and we depend upon our subsidiaries for liquidity. Applicable laws and regulations, including capital and liquidity requirements, may restrict our ability to transfer funds from our subsidiaries to us or other subsidiaries.\nTriState Capital Holdings, Inc., as the parent company, is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries. We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, including the parent company. For instance, the parent company depends on distributions and other payments from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries to fund all payments on our other obligations, including debt obligations. Our bank and investment management subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. In addition, our bank and investment management subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. These limitations may hinder our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance shareholder value which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nRisks Relating to an Investment in our Common Stock\nShares of our common stock are not an insured deposit.\nShares of our common stock are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. An investment in our common stock has risks, and you may lose your entire investment.\nAn active, liquid market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nOur common stock is listed on Nasdaq, but we may be unable to meet continued listing standards. In addition, an active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace and independent decisions of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock, over which we have no control. Without an active, liquid trading market for our common stock, shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times desired. Moreover, the lack of an established market could materially and adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock may adversely affect our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the sale of a significant quantity of our outstanding common stock (including any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock), or the perception that such a sale could\noccur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial fluctuations, which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, which may make it difficult to resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times desired. There are many factors that may impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic or business conditions;\n\u2022\nthe effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us, our competitors, or the financial services industry generally, or changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deemed comparable to us;\n\u2022\nadditional or anticipated sales of our common stock or other securities by us or our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding our competitors and/or us;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving our competitors or us;\n\u2022\nother economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and\n\u2022\nother news, announcements or disclosures (whether by us or others) related to us, our competitors, our core market or the financial services industry.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks have experienced substantial fluctuations in recent years, which in many cases have been unrelated to the operating performance and prospects of particular companies. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading volume in our common stock may cause significant price variations to occur. Increased market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which could make it difficult to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline significantly due to actual or anticipated issuances or sales of our common stock in the future.\nActual or anticipated issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly and make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and on terms that we deem appropriate. The issuance of any shares of our common stock in the future also would, and equity-related securities could, dilute the percentage ownership interest held by shareholders prior to such issuance. We may issue additional equity securities, or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for equity securities, from time to time to raise additional capital, support growth or to make acquisitions. Further, we expect to issue stock options or other stock awards to retain and motivate our employees, executives and directors. These issuances of securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of our existing shareholders.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate or continue coverage on our common stock.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these securities analysts, and they may not cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect its market price. To the extent that we are covered by securities analysts, and our common stock is the subject of an unfavorable report, the price of our common stock may decline. If one\nor more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nOur current management and board of directors have significant control over our business.\nOur directors, as well as their related parties, and executive officers beneficially own a material portion of our outstanding common stock (~24%). Consequently, our directors and executive officers, acting together, may be able to significantly affect the outcome of the election of directors and the potential outcome of other matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, such as mergers, the sale of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary corporate matters. The interests of these insiders could conflict with the interest of our shareholders, including you.\nThe rights of holders of our common stock will be subordinate to the rights of holders of any debt securities that we may issue and may be subordinate to the rights of holders of any class of preferred stock that we may issue in the future.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue debt securities or an aggregate of up to 150,000 shares of preferred stock on the terms it determines without shareholder approval. We also have issued subordinated debt which as of December 31, 2016, had an outstanding balance of $35.0 million. Any debt or shares of preferred stock that we may issue in the future could be senior to our common stock. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts is uncertain. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may to take advantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. These include, without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. We have generally elected to take advantage of these reduced requirements. The JOBS Act also permits an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. However, we have irrevocably \u201copted out\u201d of this provision, and we will comply with new or revised accounting standards to the same extent that compliance is required for non-emerging growth companies.\nWe may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years from our initial public offering, unless we earlier cease to be an emerging growth company, which would occur if our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. Investors may find our common stock less attractive to the extent that we rely on the exemptions, which may result in a less active trading market and increased volatility in our stock price.\nFulfilling our public company financial reporting and other regulatory obligations is expensive and time consuming.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are required to implement specific corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC as well as Nasdaq Stock Market Rules. In particular, we are required to file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Compliance with these requirements places significant demands on our legal, accounting and finance staff and on our accounting, financial and information systems and requires us to incur significant legal and accounting compliance costs as well as compensation expense for additional accounting, finance, legal and internal audit staff to comply with these reporting requirements. Our compliance efforts and these expenses are anticipated to increase in the future, particularly as we prepare for the time when we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, which will occur no later than as of the end of 2018 and could occur as of the end of 2017. These efforts may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe have not paid dividends and are subject to regulatory restrictions on our ability to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock since inception. Instead, we have utilized our earnings for working capital to support our operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, we are subject to certain restrictions on\nthe payment of cash dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. Finally, because TriState Capital Bank is our most significant asset, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders depends in large part on our receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is also subject to restrictions on dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. Even if we decide to pay dividends in the future (and we have not made such a decision), we would also have to comply with these regulatory restrictions.\nOur corporate governance documents, and certain corporate and banking laws applicable to us, could make a takeover more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, our bylaws, as amended, and corporate and federal banking laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our organization or conduct a proxy contest, even if those events were perceived by many of our shareholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions, and the corporate and banking laws and regulations applicable to us:\n\u2022\nempower our board of directors, without shareholder approval, to issue our preferred stock, the terms of which, including voting power, are set by our board of directors;\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into four classes serving staggered four-year terms;\n\u2022\neliminate cumulative voting in elections of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire the request of holders of at least 10% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote at a meeting to call a special shareholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022\nrequire at least 60 days\u2019 advance notice of nominations by shareholders for the election of directors and the presentation of shareholder proposals at meetings of shareholders; and\n\u2022\nrequire prior regulatory application and approval of any transaction involving control of our organization.\nThese provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, including circumstances in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the market price of our shares.\nThere are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies.\nWith certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, prospective investors need to be aware of and comply with these requirements, if applicable, in connection with any purchase of shares of our common stock. These provisions effectively inhibit certain mergers or other business combinations, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13943, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TSC"}
