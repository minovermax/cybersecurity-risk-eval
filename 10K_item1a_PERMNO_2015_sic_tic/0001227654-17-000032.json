{"cik": "1227654", "company": "COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a number of risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our securities. You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the information set forth in this report. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur mining and industrial operations involve inherently risky activities.\nOur operations involve significant risks and hazards, including environmental hazards and industrial accidents. Our underground salt mining operations and related processing activities may be subject to industrial and mining accidents, fire, explosions, unusual or unexpected geological formations, water intrusion and flooding. For example, MSHA considers our Cote Blanche, Louisiana, salt mine to be a \u201cgaseous mine\u201d and, as a result, is subject to a heightened risk of explosion and fire. The types and volumes of certain chemicals manufactured by our Plant Nutrition South America segment\u2019s chemical solutions business pose process safety management risks, including hazards related to chemical process manufacturing and the related storage, handling and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. These potential risks include pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures, explosions and fires, mechanical failure and chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases at our sites or during transportation.\nThese hazardous activities pose significant management challenges and could result in loss of life, a mine shutdown, damage to or destruction of our properties and surrounding properties, production facilities or equipment, production delays or business interruption. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or claims associated with our operations, including these operational risks.\nGeological conditions could lead to a mine shutdown, increased costs and production delays, which could adversely affect results of our operations.\nOur salt mining operations involve a complex process, which is affected by the mineralogy of the mineral deposits and structural geologic conditions and is subject to related risks. For example, unexpected geological conditions could lead to significant water inflows and flooding at any of our underground mines, which could result in a mine shutdown, serious injuries, increased operational costs, production delays, damage to our mineral deposits and equipment damage. We have minor water inflows at our Cote Blanche and Goderich salt mines that we actively monitor and manage. Underground mining also poses the potential risk of mine subsidence (i.e., collapse of the mine) because of the mine geology and rate and volume of minerals extracted.\nOur mineral reserve estimates of the remaining tons minerals in our mines are based on many factors, including the area and volume covered by our mining rights, assumptions regarding our extraction rates based upon an expectation of operating the mines on a long-term basis and the quality of in-place reserves. Our actual mineral deposits encountered in our mining operations and the economic viability of mining a mineral deposit may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, we may not be able to access certain mineral deposits as a result of the nature of the geologic formations of our salt mines, which could impact the accuracy of our salt deposit reserve projections.\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2016 FORM 10-K\nVariations in the mineralogy of our mineral deposits could limit our ability to extract our mineral deposits, increase our extraction costs, impact the purity of extracted minerals and the suitability of the extracted minerals to create products for sale and to meet customer specifications. This could adversely impact our ability to fulfill our contracts, resulting in significant contractual penalties and loss of customers.\nOur operations are conducted primarily through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities, and we are also dependent on critical equipment.\nWe conduct our operations through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities. These facilities include our underground salt mines, our evaporation plants, our SOP solar evaporation ponds and facilities, certain facilities in Brazil used by our Plant Nutrition South America businesses and the distribution facilities, depots and ports owned by us and third parties. Many of our products are produced at one or two of these facilities. Any disruption of operations at one of these facilities could significantly affect production or distribution of our products, which could damage our customer relationships.\nFor example, our two North American salt mines together constituted approximately 74% of our salt production capacity as of December 31, 2016 and supply most of the salt sold by our North American highway deicing business and significant portions of the salt sold by our consumer and industrial business. A production interruption at one of our salt mines could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our salt contracts and our ability to secure future contracts in affected markets or other markets. In addition, we only have a limited number of distribution facilities in the markets in which we sell our salt products. Failure to have our salt products at a specific distribution facility when needed (for example during a snow event) could adversely impact our ability to fulfill our highway deicing sales contracts, resulting in significant contractual penalties and loss of customers.\nSimilarly, many of our plant nutrition products are only produced at one or two facilities. We produce SOP at our solar evaporation ponds located at the Great Salt Lake and Big Quill Lake. SOP production at these solar ponds could be disrupted or negatively impacted by structural damage, as a result of dike failure or other factors, which could result in lowered sales and revenue. In addition, in our Plant Nutrition South America businesses, we use products manufactured at certain of our production facilities as inputs to products manufactured at our other production facilities in Brazil. An interruption at one of our production facilities could result in production disruptions at other facilities in Brazil, as alternative sources for raw materials or other materials might not be found at reasonable prices, on a timely basis, or at all. A production interruption or disruption at one or more of our facilities could result in a loss of customers and revenue.\nOur operations depend upon critical equipment, such as our continuous miners, hoists and conveyor belts. This equipment could be damaged or destroyed, suffer breakdowns or failures or deteriorate due to wear and tear sooner than we estimate, and we may be unable to replace or repair the equipment in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost. If these events occur, we may incur additional maintenance and capital expenditures, our operations could be materially disrupted and we may not be able to produce and ship our products.\nOur business is capital intensive, and the inability to fund necessary capital expenditures or successfully complete our capital projects could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability.\nWe are in the process of a shaft relining project, implementing continuous mining at our Goderich, Canada, mine and expanding our SOP processing plant at our Great Salt Lake facility in Ogden, Utah, which will require us to make significant capital expenditures in 2017. Significant capital expenditures are required to maintain our existing facilities and the capital required to maintain these facilities can fluctuate significantly. These activities or other capital projects may require the temporary suspension of production at our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nOur capital projects involve risks, including cost overruns, delays and performance uncertainties, and could interrupt our ongoing operations. The expected benefits from these capital projects may not be realized in accordance with our projections, despite the significant capital expenditures. Our capital projects may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences, such as the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other operational matters or significant disruptions to our ongoing operations.\nAlthough we currently finance most of our capital expenditures through cash provided by operations, we also may depend on increased borrowing or other financing arrangements to fund future capital expenditures. If we are unable to obtain suitable financing, we may not be able to complete our capital projects and our ability to maintain or expand our facilities in the future may be limited. The occurrence of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur production processes rely on the consumption of natural gas, electricity and certain other raw materials. A significant interruption in the supply or an increase in the price of any of these could adversely affect our business.\nEnergy costs, primarily natural gas and electricity, represented a substantial part of our total production costs in 2016. Our profitability is impacted by the price and availability of natural gas and electricity we purchase from third parties. Natural gas is a primary energy source used in the evaporated salt production process. Our contractual arrangements for the supply of natural gas have terms of up to three years, do not specify quantities and are automatically renewed unless either party elects not to do so. In addition, electricity is a primary fuel source used by our Plant Nutrition South America businesses and we have electricity contracts with terms of up to three years. We do not have arrangements in place with back-up suppliers. We use natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas. A significant increase in the price of energy that\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2016 FORM 10-K\nis not recovered through an increase in the price of our products or covered through our hedging arrangements, or an extended interruption in the supply of natural gas or electricity to our production facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use KCl in our salt and plant nutrition operations. Large negative price fluctuations in KCl can occur without a corresponding change in sales price to our customers. This could change the profitability of our products that require KCl, which could materially affect the results of our operations.\nThe results of our operations are dependent on and vary due to weather conditions. Additionally, adverse weather conditions or significant changes in weather patterns could adversely affect us.\nWeather conditions, including amounts, timing and duration of wintry precipitation and snow events, excessive hot or cold temperatures, rainfall and drought, can significantly impact our sales, production, costs and operational results and impact our customers. From year to year, sales of our highway deicing products and profitability of the salt segment may be affected by weather conditions in our markets. Any prolonged change in weather patterns in our markets, as a result of climate change or otherwise, could have a material impact the results of our operations.\nIn addition, our ability to produce SOP, salt and magnesium chloride from our solar evaporation ponds in Ogden, Utah, is dependent upon sufficient lake brine levels and hot, arid summer weather conditions. Prolonged periods of precipitation, lack of sunshine, cooler weather during the evaporation season or increased mountain snowfall fresh water run-off could reduce the evaporation rate and our production levels. Similarly, drought or decreased mountain snowfall fresh water run-off could accelerate the evaporation rate or change brine levels, impacting our mineral harvesting process, amount and timing. In recent years, the Great Salt Lake area has experienced a severe drought. As a result, lake brine levels have been altered and we may experience a disruption in our typical two- to three-year evaporation production cycle. Similar factors could negatively impact the lake level and concentration of sulfates at the Big Quill Lake, impacting the production at our Wynyard facility. The occurrence of these events at the Great Salt Lake or Big Quill Lake could lead to decreased production levels, increased operating costs and significant additional capital expenditures.\nWeather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural industry (and indirectly in our results of operations) by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which can adversely affect crop yields, application rates, demand for our plant nutrition products and our customers\u2019 creditworthiness. Drought can also adversely impact growers\u2019 crop yields and the uptake of plant nutrients, reducing the need for application of plant nutrition products for the next planting season which could result in lower demand for our plant nutrition products and impact sale prices.\nFuture climate change could adversely affect us.\nThe potential impact of climate change on our operations, product demand and the needs of our customers remains uncertain. Scientists have proposed that the impacts of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels and that these changes could be severe. These impacts could vary by geographic location as well as negatively impact customer demand for our products and our costs and ability to produce our products. In addition, potential climate change regulations or other carbon or emissions taxes could result in higher costs.\nOur indebtedness and ability to pay our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2016, we had $1.33 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including $951.3 million of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, which is further described in Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We pay significant interest on our indebtedness, with variable interest on our borrowing under our senior secured credit facilities based on prevailing interest rates. Significant increases in interest rates will increase the interest we pay on our debt. Our significant indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional money or sell our stock to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nimpact our ability to implement our business strategy and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business as well as changes to economic, regulatory or other competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with greater financial resources;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes; and\n\u2022\nmaterially and adversely affect our business and financial condition if we are unable to meet our debt service requirements or obtain additional financing.\nIn the future, we may incur additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness or refinance, the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could increase. Financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on commercially reasonable or satisfactory terms.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness, refinance our indebtedness and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate future cash flows from operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic,\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2016 FORM 10-K\nfinancial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments with respect to our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If this were the case, we might need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity financing. Our inability to obtain needed financing or generate sufficient cash flows from operations may require us to abandon or curtail capital projects, strategic initiatives or other investments or impair our ability to make acquisitions, enter into joint ventures or engage in other activities, which could materially impact our business.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business or require accelerated debt payments.\nOur agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations or grant liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase or redeem our stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nprepay, or amend the terms of, certain junior indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengage in sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmake changes to our organizational documents or fiscal periods;\n\u2022\nenter into third-party agreements that limit our ability to grant liens on our assets or make certain intercompany dividends, investments or asset transfers;\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates; and\n\u2022\nacquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies.\nThe credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities also requires us to maintain financial ratios, including an interest coverage ratio and a total leverage ratio, which we may be unable to maintain. As of December 31, 2016, our total leverage ratio is 3.9, and if our leverage ratio exceeds 4.5 we would be in default under our credit agreement.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the covenants, financial tests and ratios required by the agreements governing our indebtedness. If we default under our agreements governing our indebtedness, our lenders could cease to make further extensions of credit, accelerate payments under our other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions and foreclose upon any collateral securing that debt as well as restrict our ability to make certain investments and payments, pay dividends, purchase our stock, enter into transactions with affiliates, make acquisitions, merge and consolidate, or transfer or dispose of assets.\nIf our lenders were to require immediate repayment, we may need to obtain new financing to be able to repay them immediately, which may not be available or, if available, may not be available on commercially reasonable or satisfactory terms. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations.\nWe are subject to tax liabilities which could adversely impact our profitability, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe are subject to income tax in the U.S., Canada, Brazil and U.K. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws. For example, certain versions of recent U.S. tax reform proposals as well as future tax reform proposals could, if enacted, have a material impact on our tax expense and cash flows. We are also subject to audits in various jurisdictions and may be assessed additional taxes during an audit.\nCanadian federal and provincial tax authorities have challenged our tax positions and assessed additional taxes on us, including for years which had been previously settled by agreement among us, the Canadian federal taxing authority and the U.S. federal taxing authority (described in Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). These tax assessments and future tax assessments could be material if the disputes are not resolved in our favor.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations that could be challenged by taxing authorities. This includes the values charged on the transfer of products between our subsidiaries. Although we believe our tax estimates and calculations are reasonable, they have been challenged by taxing authorities in the past. The final determination of any tax audits and litigation may take several years and be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals in our financial statements. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition, income tax provision and net income in the affected periods as well as future profitability, cash flows and our ability to pay dividends and service our debt.\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2016 FORM 10-K\nWe are subject to financial assurance requirements and failure to satisfy these requirements could materially affect our business, results of our operations and our financial condition.\nIn connection with our dispute of tax assessments made by Canadian federal and provincial tax authorities (described in Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements), we are required to post and maintain financial performance bonds. In addition, as part of our business operations, we are required to maintain financial surety or performance bonds with certain of our North American highway deicing customers and to fund mine reclamation and site cleanup following the ultimate closure of our mines. We incur costs to maintain these financial assurance bonds and failure to satisfy these financial assurance requirements could materially affect our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition.\nIf our customers are unable to access credit, they may be not be able to purchase our products. In addition, we extend trade credit to certain customers and guarantee financing that certain customers use to purchase our products and the results of our operations may be adversely affected if customers default on these obligations.\nSome of our customers require access to credit to purchase our products. A lack of available credit to customers, due to global or local economic conditions or for other reasons, could adversely affect demand for our products and the sales of our products.\nWe extend trade credit to our customers in the United States and throughout the world, in some cases for extended periods of time. In Brazil, where there are fewer third-party financing sources available to farmers, we also have several programs under which we guarantee customers\u2019 financing from financial institutions that they use to purchase our products. If these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks, the results of our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, increases in prices for other inputs may increase the working capital requirements, indebtedness and other liabilities of our customers, and increase the risk that they will default on the trade credit from us or their financing that we guarantee, and decrease the likelihood that we will be able to collect from our customers in the event of their default.\nWe may be restricted from paying cash dividends on our common stock in the future.\nWe have declared and paid regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, earnings, legal requirements, restrictions in our debt agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Although our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries, none of our subsidiaries is obligated to make funds available to pay dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries.\nCertain agreements governing our indebtedness contain limitations on our ability to pay dividends (including regular annual dividends). Among other things, dividends to shareholders are limited in the aggregate to $100 million plus 50% of the preceding year net income (as defined in our credit facility). In addition, we may be restricted from paying dividends to our stockholders if our total leverage ratio exceeds 4.5x (actual ratio of 3.9x as of December 31, 2016) or if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the credit agreement. We cannot provide assurances that the agreements governing our current and future indebtedness will permit us to pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur products face strong competition and if we fail to successfully attract and retain customers and invest in product development, capital improvements and productivity improvements, sales of our products could be adversely affected.\nWe encounter strong competition in many areas of our business and our competitors may have significantly more financial resources than we do. Competition in our product lines is based on a number of factors, including product quality and performance, logistics (especially in salt distribution and Brazil chlor-alkali products), brand reputation, price and quality of customer service and support. Many of our customers attempt to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to increase their efficiency. Our customers demand a broad product range and we must continue to develop our expertise in order to manufacture and market these products successfully. To remain competitive, we need to invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position. We may have to adjust our prices, strategy, distribution efforts or marketing to stay competitive.\nThe demand for our products may be adversely affected by technological advances or the development of new or less costly competing products. For example, the development of substitutes for our products that can more efficiently mix with other agricultural inputs or have more efficient application methods may impact the demand for our products. Many of our products, including sodium chloride, magnesium chloride and SOP, have historically been characterized by a slow pace of technological advances. However, new production methods or sources for our products or the development of substitute or competing products could materially adversely affect the demand and sales of our products.\nChanges in competitors\u2019 production, geographic or marketing focus could have a material impact on our business. We face global competition from new and existing competitors who have entered or may enter the markets in which we sell. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do or are more diversified, making them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. Our competitive position could suffer if we are unable to expand our operations through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships.\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2016 FORM 10-K\nRisks associated with our international operations and sales could adversely affect our business and earnings.\nWe have significant operations in Canada, Brazil and the U.K. and our 2016 sales outside the U.S. were approximately 33% of our total 2016 sales. Our overall success as a global business depends on our ability to operate successfully in differing economic, political and cultural conditions. Our international operations and sales are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\neconomic developments including changes in currency exchange rates, inflation risks, exchange controls, tariffs, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with complying with laws, treaties and regulations, including tax laws and labor regulations, and changes to laws, treaties and regulations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from our subsidiaries and withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\npolitical developments, government deadlock, political instability, political activism, terrorist activities, civil unrest and international conflicts.\nA significant portion of our cash flow is generated in Canadian dollars, Brazilian Reais and British pounds sterling and our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars. Our reported results can significantly increase or decrease based on exchange rate volatility after translation of our results into U.S. dollars. Exchange rate fluctuations could also impact our ability to meet interest and principal payments on our U.S. dollar-denominated debt. In addition, we incur currency transaction risk when we enter into a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity. We may not be able to effectively manage our currency risks. For more information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Effects of Currency Fluctuations and Inflation,\u201d and \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nIn addition, we may face more competition in periods when foreign currency exchange rates are favorable to our competitors. A relatively strong U.S. dollar increases the attractiveness of the U.S. market for some of our international competitors while decreasing the attractiveness of other markets to us. Similarly, a relatively strong Brazilian Reais increases the attractiveness of the Brazil market for our international competitors.\nThe decision by U.K. voters to leave the European Union could cause volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased regulatory complexities. These changes may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nAnticipated changes in plant nutrition prices and customer application rates can have a significant effect on the demand and price for our plant nutrition products.\nWhen customers anticipate increasing plant nutrition selling prices, they tend to accumulate inventories in advance of the expected price increase. Similarly, customers tend to delay their purchases when they anticipate future selling prices for plant nutrition products will stabilize or decrease. These customer expectations can lead to a lag in our ability to realize price increases for our products and adversely impact our sales volumes and selling prices.\nCustomer expectations about agricultural economics may impact the demand for our products. Growers\u2019 decision to purchase plant nutrition products and the application rate for plant nutrition products depend on many factors, including expected grower income, crop prices, plant nutrition prices and nutrient levels in the soil. Customers are more likely to decrease purchases and application rates when they expect declining agricultural economics or relatively high plant nutrition costs, other input costs prices and soil nutrient levels. This variability can materially impact our prices and volumes.\nThe demand for our products is seasonal.\nThe demand for both our salt and plant nutrition products is seasonal, and the degree of seasonality can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions, including the number of snow events, rainfall and other factors.\nOur salt deicing business is seasonal. On average, over the last three years, approximately two-thirds of our deicing product sales occurred during the North American and European winter months of November through March each year. Winter weather events are not predictable, yet we must stand ready to deliver deicing products to local communities with little advance notice under the requirements of our highway deicing contracts. As a result, we attempt to stockpile our highway deicing salt throughout the year to meet estimated demand for the winter season. Failure to deliver under our highway deicing contracts may result in significant financial penalties under those contracts and could lead to future loss of customers in geographies we serve.\nOur plant nutrition business is also seasonal. For example, the strongest demand for our plant nutrition products in Brazil typically occurs during the spring planting season. As a result, we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales season. The seasonality of this demand results in our sales volumes and net sales for our Plant Nutrition South America segment usually being the highest during the third and fourth quarters of each year (as the spring planting season begins in September in Brazil).\nIf seasonal demand is greater than we expect, we may experience product shortages, and our customers may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from us. If seasonal demand is less than we expect, we may have excess inventory that will have to be stored (in which case we may incur increased storage costs) or liquidated (in which case the selling price may be below our costs). If prices for our products rapidly decrease, we may be subject to inventory write-\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2016 FORM 10-K\ndowns. Our inventories may also become impaired through obsolescence or the quality may be impaired if our inventories are not stored properly.\nConditions in the agricultural sector and supply and demand imbalances for competing plant nutrition products can also impact the price and demand for our products.\nConditions in the North American and Brazilian agricultural sectors can significantly impact our plant nutrition business. The North America and Brazil agricultural sector can be affected by a number of factors, including weather conditions, field conditions (particularly during periods of traditionally high plant nutrition application), government policies and import and export markets.\nDemand for our products in the agricultural sector is affected by crop prices, type of crops planted, planted acreage and application rates, crop yields, product acceptance, driven by population growth and changes in dietary habits, among other things. Supply is affected by available capacity, operating rates, raw material costs and availability, feasible transportation, government policies and global trade. In addition, the demand and price of plant nutrition products can be affected by factors such as plant disease. For example, Asian soybean rust has in certain years affected soybean crops in Brazil and the United States, reducing demand for plant nutrition products.\nMOP is the least expensive form of potash fertilizer and, consequently, it is the most widely used potassium source for most crops. SOP is utilized by growers for many high-value crops, especially crops for which low-chloride content fertilizers or the presence of sulfur improves quality and yield, such as almonds and other tree nuts, avocado, citrus, lettuce tobacco, grapes, strawberries and other berries. Lower prices or demand for these crops could adversely affect demand for our products and the results of our operations.\nWhen the demand and price of potash are high, our competitors are more likely to increase their production and invest in increased production capacity. An over-supply of MOP or SOP domestically or worldwide could unfavorably impact the prices we can charge for our SOP, as a large price disparity between potash products could cause growers to choose MOP or other less-expensive alternatives, which could adversely impact our sales volume and the results of our operations.\nIncreasing costs or a lack of availability of transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver products at competitive prices.\nTransportation and handling costs are a significant component of our total product cost, particularly for our salt products. The high relative cost of transportation favors producers whose mines or facilities are located near the customers it serves. We contract bulk shipping vessels, barges, trucking and rail services to move our products from our production facilities to distribution outlets and customers. A reduction in the dependability or availability of transportation services or a significant increase in transportation service rates, including the impact of weather and water levels on the waterways we use, could impair our ability to deliver our products economically to our customers or expand our markets. For example, if the Mississippi river floods significantly, barges may be unable to traverse the river system and we may be prevented from timely delivering our salt products to our customers, which could increase costs to deliver our products and adversely impact our ability to fulfill our contracts, resulting in significant contractual penalties and loss of customers.\nIn addition, diesel fuel is a significant component of our transportation costs. Some of our customer contracts allow for full or partial recovery of changes in diesel fuel costs through an adjustment to the selling price. However, a significant increase in the price of diesel fuel that is not recovered through transportation costs we are able to pass through to our customers could materially increase our costs and adversely affect our financial results.\nSignificant transportation costs associated with certain of our products, including our salt products and certain products sold by our Plant Nutrition South America segment, limit our ability to increase our market share or serve new markets.\nStrikes, other forms of work stoppage or slowdown and other union activities could disrupt our business and negatively impact our financial results.\nApproximately 40% of our workforce in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. and approximately 25% of our global workforce is represented by collective bargaining agreements. Of our 13 collective bargaining agreements, four will expire in 2017, four will expire in 2018 and five will expire in 2019. Trade union membership is common in Europe and required in Brazil, where our workforce is also located. Unsuccessful contract negotiations or adverse labor relations could result in strikes, work stoppages and work slowdowns, which could disrupt our business and operations. These disruptions could negatively impact our operations, our ability to produce or sell our products and our ability to recruit and retain personnel and could result in additional costs to resolve disputes. For example, we are involved in proceedings alleging unfair labor practices at our Cote Blanche, Louisiana, mine, arising out of a labor dispute between us and the United Steelworkers Union over the terms of a contract for certain employees at the mine (described in Note 12 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). We have recorded a reserve in our consolidated financial statements related to expected payments required to resolve the dispute; however, the reserved amounts may not be sufficient and we may incur significant additional costs.\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2016 FORM 10-K\nOur business is dependent upon highly skilled personnel, and the loss of key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our performance.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled personnel. We may not be able to attract, develop and retain the personnel necessary for the efficient operation of our business, and our inability to do so could result in decreased productivity and efficiency, higher costs, the use of less-qualified personnel and reputational harm, which may have a material adverse effect on our performance. The loss of certain key employees could damage critical customer relationships, result in the loss of vital institutional knowledge, experience and expertise, and impact our ability to successfully operate our business and execute our business strategy. We may not be able to find qualified replacements for these key positions and the integration of replacements may be disruptive to our business. In addition, the loss of our key employees who have intimate knowledge of our research and development, mining or manufacturing processes could lead to increased competition to the extent that those employees are hired by a competitor and are able to recreate our processes or share our confidential information.\nOur operations depend on our rights and governmental authorizations to mine and operate our properties.\nWe hold numerous environmental and mineral extraction permits, water rights and other permits, licenses and approvals from governmental authorities authorizing operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a governmental agency to revoke, substantially modify, deny or delay renewal of or apply conditions to an existing permit, license or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and result in significant costs. For example, certain indigenous groups have challenged the Canadian government\u2019s ownership of the land under which our Goderich, Ontario, facility is operated. There can be no assurances that the Canadian government\u2019s ownership will be upheld or that our existing mining and operating permits will not be revoked or otherwise affected. In addition, although we do not engage in fracking, laws and regulations targeting fracking could lead to increased permit requirements and compliance costs for non-fracking operations, including our salt operations, which require permitted wastewater disposal wells.\nFurthermore, many of our facilities are located on land leased from governmental authorities or third parties. Our leases generally require us to continue mining in order to retain the lease, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and result in significant costs. In some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. Loss of these access rights or easements could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, many of our facilities are located near existing and proposed third-party industrial operations that could affect our ability to fully extract, or the manner in which we extract, the mineral deposits to which we have mining rights. For example, certain neighboring operations or land uses may require setbacks that could prevent us from mining portions of our mineral reserves or using certain mining methods.\nExpansion of our operations or production capacity, or preservation of existing rights in some cases, is also predicated upon securing any necessary permits, licenses and approvals. For example, we may require additional permits, licenses and approvals to continue diverting water from the Great Salt Lake based on lake conditions. We may not be granted the necessary permits, licenses and approvals. A decision by a governmental agency to deny, delay issuing or apply conditions to any new permits, licenses and approvals could adversely affect our ability to operate and the results of our operations.\nWe may not be able to expand our business through acquisitions, and acquisitions may not perform as expected, we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses and anticipated benefits may not be realized.\nOur business strategy includes supplementing organic growth with acquisitions of complementary businesses. We may not have acquisition opportunities because we may not identify suitable businesses to acquire, we compete with other potential buyers, we may not have or be able to obtain suitable financing for an acquisition and we may be hindered by competition and regulatory laws. If we cannot make acquisitions, our business growth may be limited.\nAcquisitions of new businesses, including our recently completed Produqu\u00edmica acquisition, may not perform as expected, may not positively impact our financial performance and could increase our debt obligations. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management attention, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence.\nOur ability to realize benefits from our recent Produqu\u00edmica acquisition depends on several factors, including the growth and health of the Brazilian and international agribusiness industry, our ability to innovate and develop new products, the continued demand for innovative specialty essential nutritional supplement products and successful geographical expansion inside and outside Brazil. We may not successfully implement our proposed business strategies, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of any acquisition, including our Produqu\u00edmica acquisition, will also depend on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the acquired business. We may fail to integrate acquired businesses in a timely and efficient manner. The integration process could result in the loss of key employees, higher than expected costs, ongoing diversion of management attention from other strategic opportunities or operational matters, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or increased risk that our internal controls are found to be ineffective.\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2016 FORM 10-K\nCompliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other applicable anti-corruption and anti-competition laws, may increase the cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.\nVarious laws and regulations associated with our international operations are complex and increase our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include but are not limited to import and export requirements, anti-competition regulations, and anti-corruption laws such as the FCPA, the Brazilian Clean Companies Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. We cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation, administration and enforcement will change over time. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of these laws. Any such violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including fines or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, debarment from government contracts (and termination of existing contracts) and could also materially damage our reputation, brand, international expansion efforts, business and operating results. In addition, changes to the trade or anti-competition laws that could affect our operating practices or impose liability on us in a manner that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to EHS laws and regulations which could become more stringent and adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to an evolving set of international, national, federal, foreign state, provincial and local EHS laws and regulations. New or proposed EHS regulatory programs, as well as future interpretations and enforcement of existing EHS laws and regulations, may require modification to our facilities, substantial increases in equipment and operating costs or interruptions, modifications or a termination of operations, which may involve significant capital costs or increases in operating costs.\nFor example, governmental initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions under consideration and future initiatives could, if adopted, restrict our operations and require us to make capital expenditures to improve our facilities. We are also impacted by the Clean Air Act and other EHS laws and regulations that regulate air emissions. These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify our operational practices, obtain additional permits or make other expenditures. Our Ogden, Utah, facility is located in an area expected to be of continued focus by the Utah Air Quality Board with respect certain air emissions under the Clean Air Act.\nIn addition, if new Clean Water Act regulations are adopted or increased compliance obligations are imposed on existing regulations, we could be adversely affected. For example, a significant portion of our salt products are distributed through salt depots owned and operated by third parties. If these depots are required to adopt more stringent stormwater management practices or are subject to increased compliance requirements under existing Clean Water Act regulations, these depots may pass on any increased costs to us, exit the depot business (requiring us to find new depot partners or establish Company-owned depots) or otherwise cause an adverse impact to our ability to deliver salt to our customers. See \u201cEnvironmental, Health and Safety Matters\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report for more information about EHS laws and regulations affecting us and their potential impact on us.\nWe could incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to our current, future or former facilities, adjacent or nearby third-party facilities or off-site disposal locations.\nRisks of environmental liabilities is inherent in our current and former operations. At many of our past and present facilities, releases and disposal of regulated substances has occurred and could occur in the future, which could require us to investigate, undertake or pay for remediation activities under the CERCLA and other similar EHS laws and regulations. The use, handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances currently or formerly used by us, or the liabilities arising from past releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances, may result in future expenditures that could materially and adversely affect our financial results, cash flows or financial condition. Our facilities are also subject to laws and regulations which require us to monitor and detect potential environmental hazards and damages. Our procedures and controls may not be sufficient to timely identify and protect against potential environmental damages and related costs.\nWe record accruals for contingent environmental liabilities when we believe it is probable that we will be responsible, in whole or in part, for environmental investigation or remediation activities and the expenditures for these activities are reasonably estimable. For example, we have ongoing investigation and remediation activities at our Kenosha, Wisconsin, plant, which are described in Note 12 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the extent and costs of any environmental investigation or remediation activities are inherently uncertain and difficult to estimate and could exceed our expectations, which could materially affect our financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, we previously sold a portion of our U.K. salt mine to a subsidiary of Veolia, which operates a waste management business. The Veolia business, under governmental permits, is allowed to securely dispose certain hazardous waste at the property they own and pays us fees for engaging in this activity. We could incur future expenditures to address risks related to this hazardous waste disposal or to remediate any contamination. See \u201cEnvironmental, Health and Safety Matters\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report for more information about CERCLA and other EHS laws and regulations affecting us and their potential impact on us.\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2016 FORM 10-K\nIf our computer systems and information technology are compromised, our ability to conduct our business will be adversely impacted.\nWe rely on computer systems and information technology to conduct our business, including cash management, order entry, vendor payments, employee salaries and recordkeeping, inventory and asset management, shipping of products, and communication with employees and customers. We also use our systems to analyze and communicate our operating results and other data to internal and external recipients. In 2017, we expect to implement a comprehensive update to our enterprise resource planning system that impacts substantially all of our key processes. Any implementation issues could have adverse effects on our ability to properly capture, process and report financial transactions, distribute our products and invoice and collect from our customers and lead to increased expenditures. While we have taken steps to ensure the security of our information technology systems, we may be susceptible to cyber-attacks, computer viruses and other technological disruptions. A material failure or interruption of access to our computer systems for an extended period of time or the loss of confidential or proprietary data could adversely affect our operations and regulatory compliance. While we have mitigation and data recovery plans in place, it is possible that significant capital investment and time may be required to correct any of these issues. The additional capital investment needed to prevent or correct any of these issues may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets, to be a valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights primarily through a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret protection. Our patents, which vary in duration, may not preclude others from selling competitive products or using similar production processes. We cannot provide assurances that pending applications for protection of our intellectual property rights will be approved. Our trademark registrations may not prevent our competitors from using similar brand names. We also rely on trade secret protection to guard confidential unpatented technology, and when appropriate, we require that employees and third-party consultants or advisors enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. It is possible that our competitors could independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology.\nMany of our brand names are registered as trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries. The laws in certain foreign countries in which we do business do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. law. As a result, these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products, services and brands in foreign jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be upheld if challenged. Such claims, if proven, could materially and adversely affect our business and may lead to the impairment of the amounts recorded for goodwill and other intangible assets. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we may lose any competitive advantage provided by our intellectual property. In addition, although any such claims may ultimately prove to be without merit, the necessary management attention to and legal costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could be significant.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements.\nOur global business is subject to the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign law, regulations and regulatory authorities as well as industry standard-setting authorities. Changes in the standards and requirements imposed by these laws, regulations and authorities could negatively affect our ability to serve our customers and our business. In the event that we are unable to meet any new or modified standards when adopted, our business could be adversely affected.\nFor example, if significant import duties were imposed on the salt we import into the U.S. from our Goderich mine or if we were unable to include the transfer price of such salt in the cost of goods sold, our financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could preclude us from conducting business with governmental entities and lead to penalties, injunctions, civil remedies or fines.\nWe may face significant product liability claims and product recalls, which could harm our business and reputation.\nWe face exposure to product liability and other claims if our products cause harm, are alleged to have caused harm or have the potential to cause harm to consumers. In addition, our products or products manufactured by our customers using our products could be subject to a product recall as a result of product contamination, our failure to meet product specifications or other causes. For example, our customers use our food-grade salt products in food items they produce, such as cheese and bread, which could be subject to a product recall if our products are contaminated or adulterated. Similarly, the use and application of our animal feed and plant nutrition products could result in a product recall if it were alleged that they were contaminated. Additionally, our water treatment chemicals are sold to state and municipal entities and other customers, and could result in contaminants entering waterways and the public water system.\nA product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and production delays to identify the underlying cause of the recall. We could be held liable for costs related to our customers\u2019 product recall if our products cause the recall or other product liability claims if our products cause harm to our customers. Additionally, a significant\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n2016 FORM 10-K\nproduct liability case, product recall or failure to meet products specifications could result in adverse publicity, harm to our brand and reputation and significant costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe may be negatively impacted if we are unable to obtain required product registrations or if we face increased regulatory requirements.\nGlobally, there are directives, laws and regulations that require registration of our products before they can be sold, impose labeling requirements and require our products to be manufactured to certain specifications. Each country, state and province appoints regulatory agencies responsible for these requirements, and many of our products must be registered with these regulatory agencies. A decision to deny the registration of a new product or to delay, revoke or modify an existing product registration may have a material adverse effect on us and could impede our ability to implement our business strategies. In addition, regulatory and labeling requirements could increase, which could require increased expenditures. For example, many regulatory agencies continue to evaluate potential health and environmental impacts that could arise from the handling and use of new and existing plant nutrition products. These evaluations or other developments could result in additional regulatory requirements for plant nutrition producers, including us, or for our customers, and could negatively impact the demand for our products.", "PERMNO": 89952, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "CMP"}
