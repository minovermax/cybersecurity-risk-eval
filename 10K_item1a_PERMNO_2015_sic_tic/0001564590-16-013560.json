{"cik": "1177702", "company": "SAIA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nSaia stockholders should be aware of certain risks, including those described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which could adversely affect the value of their holdings and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements.\nWe are subject to general economic conditions that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nOur business is subject to a number of general economic conditions that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, many of which are largely out of our control. These include recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customer business cycles. Economic conditions may adversely affect the business levels of our customers, the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services.\nWeakness or a loss of confidence in financial markets could adversely impact demand for our services.\nWeakness or a loss of confidence in the financial markets could cause broader economic downturns and impact the ability of our customers to access the capital or credit markets which may lead to lower demand for our services, increased incidence of customers\u2019\ninability to pay their accounts, or insolvency of our customers, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and financial condition.\nPotential disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business, including the availability and cost of short-term funds for liquidity and letter of credit requirements and our ability to meet long-term commitments which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nIf internal funds are not available from our operations, we may be required to rely on the capital and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our bank revolving credit facility. Our access to funds under that credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time.\nLonger term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.\nWe are dependent on cost and availability of qualified drivers and purchased transportation.\nThere is significant competition for qualified drivers within the trucking industry and attracting and retaining drivers has become more challenging. Regulatory requirements, including the CSA, have contributed to the reduction in the number of eligible drivers and may continue to do so in the future. We may periodically experience shortages of qualified drivers that could result in us not meeting customer demands, upward pressure on driver wages, underutilization of our truck fleet and/or use of higher cost purchased transportation which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. There is also significant competition for quality purchased transportation within the trucking industry. We may periodically experience shortages of quality purchased transportation that could result in higher costs for these services or prevent us from meeting customer demands which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are dependent on cost and availability of fuel.\nFuel is a significant operating expense and its availability is vital to daily operations. We do not hedge against the risk of fuel price increases. Global political events, acts of terrorism, federal, state and local regulations, natural disasters and other external factors could influence the cost and availability of fuel. Historically, we have been able to obtain fuel from various sources and in the desired quantities, but there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future and any shortage or interruption in the supply or distribution of fuel could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Volatility in fuel prices to the extent not offset by fuel surcharges or other customer price changes could also have a material adverse effect on operating results. Historically, we have been able to offset significant fuel price volatility through fuel surcharges and other pricing adjustments but we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future. In recent years, given the significance of fuel surcharges, the negotiation of customer price increases has become commingled with fuel surcharges. We have experienced cost increases in other operating costs as a result of volatility in fuel prices; however, the total impact of volatility in energy prices on other non-fuel related expenses is difficult to determine. Fluctuations in our fuel surcharge recovery may result in fluctuations in our revenue. A rapid and significant volatility in diesel fuel prices would reduce our profitability until we make the appropriate adjustments to our pricing strategy.\nWe may face risks related to the geographic concentration of our customers.\nWe have operations throughout the South, Southwest, Midwest, Pacific Northwest and West. As a result, changes in the economic climate, consumer trends, market fluctuations or supply shortages in these regions could decrease demand for our services in these regions and may adversely impact our operations and profitability. For example, the energy sector is important to local economies in several of these regions. If the recent declines in oil and gas prices continue, this could reduce the demand for our services in these regions, which could also adversely affect our operations and profitability. In 2015, a portion of our revenue losses were attributable to a slowdown in the energy sector due to steep declines in oil and natural gas prices, and we expect that trend to continue while oil prices remain depressed.\nLimited supply and increased prices of new revenue equipment and real estate may adversely impact financial results and cash flows.\nInvestment in new revenue equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures. We may have difficulty in purchasing new trucks due to decreased supply, increased demand and restrictions on the availability of capital and the price of such equipment may increase as a result of future regulations on newly manufactured diesel engines and required technology. Our business model is also dependent on cost and availability of terminal facilities in key metropolitan areas. Shortages in the availability of suitable real estate or delays in construction due to difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals may require significant additional investment in leasing, purchasing or building facilities, increase our operating expenses and/or prevent us from efficiently serving certain markets. In addition, we may not realize sufficient revenues or profits from our infrastructure investments.\nThe engines in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions-control regulations which could substantially increase operating expenses and future regulations concerning emissions or fuel-efficiency may adversely impact financial results.\nTractor engines that comply with the EPA emission-control design requirements have been generally less fuel-efficient in the past and have increased maintenance costs compared to engines in tractors manufactured before these requirements became effective. If we are unable to offset resulting increases in fuel expenses or maintenance costs with higher freight rates, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFuture strengthening of EPA or other regulatory requirements regarding fuel-efficiency of tractors could also result in increases in the cost of capital equipment and maintenance. While savings on fuel costs resulting from the use of more fuel-efficient equipment could mitigate these additional expenses in part, the impact of future regulations cannot be projected at this time.\nIn February 2014, President Obama announced that the EPA and the DOT have been ordered to propose additional regulations to reduce exhaust emissions and increase fuel efficiency for heavy-duty trucks manufactured after 2018. The agencies are expected to implement final rules by March 2016, which will build upon the fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks implemented for 2014-2018 model trucks. While the impact of these regulations cannot be ascertained at this time, such regulations could increase the cost of capital equipment and maintenance expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur Company-specific performance improvement initiatives, including management of the cost structure to match shifts in customer volume levels, may not be effective.\nOperating performance improvement at Saia is dependent on the implementation and/or the continuation of various performance improvement initiatives. There can be no assurance that Saia will be successful in implementing these performance improvement initiatives or that Saia\u2019s historical performance trend will be representative of future performance. In addition, we are capital intensive with a relatively high fixed-cost structure that is difficult to adjust to match shifting volume levels. Failure to achieve performance improvement initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and highly taxed industry. Costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe DOT and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and financial reporting. We may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations imposed by the DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or other authorities relating to engine exhaust emissions, driver hours of service, security, ergonomics, as well as other unforeseen matters. Compliance with such regulations could substantially impair equipment productivity and increase our costs. Various federal and state authorities impose significant operating taxes on the transportation industry, including fuel taxes, tolls, excise and other taxes. There can be no assurance such taxes will not substantially increase or that new forms of operating taxes will not be imposed on the industry.\nThe FMCSA has amended rules on motor carrier driver hours of service which limit the maximum number of hours a driver may be on duty between mandatory off-duty hours. Our operations were adjusted to comply with these rules, and while our base operations were not materially affected, we did experience deterioration in the cost, availability and reliability of purchased transportation. Revisions to these rules, as a result of pending or future legal challenges or any future requirements for on-board recorders, could further impact our operations, further tighten the market for qualified drivers and put additional pressure on driver wages and purchased transportation costs.\nThe Transportation Security Administration continues to focus on trailer security, driver identification and security clearance and border crossing procedures. These and other safety and security measures, such as rules for transportation of hazardous materials could increase the cost of operations, reduce the number of qualified drivers and disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries for our customers.\nThe FDA issues rules for carriers of foodstuffs like us to provide for the security of food and foodstuffs throughout the supply chain. The SFTA shifted responsibility for the regulation of food transportation from the U.S. Department of Transportation to the FDA. In February 2014, the FDA published a proposed rule to establish requirements under SFTA for vehicles and transportation equipment, transportation operations, training, record keeping and waivers. The proposed rule aims to continue the use of best practices in the industry concerning cleaning, inspection, maintenance, loading and unloading of, and operation of vehicles. Carriers would also be required to develop and implement written procedures subject to recordkeeping that specify its practices for cleaning, sanitizing, and inspecting vehicles and transportation equipment. The rule is expected to become final in March 2016. Although we already strive to adhere to such best practices, the impact of the final rule is uncertain and compliance may incur additional expenses and affect our operations.\nHistorically, the EPA has issued regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines. These regulations increased the cost of replacing and maintaining trucks and increased fuel costs by reducing miles per gallon. These regulations have the potential to reduce availability of fuel and reduce productivity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe FMCSA proposed a requirement that electronic driver logs be monitored by Electronic Log Devices (ELDs) for many in-state-only drivers and most interstate commercial motor vehicle drivers by no later than December 18, 2017. Drivers voluntarily using a compliant automatic on-board recording device by the December 18, 2017, deadline will be \u201cgrandfathered\u201d for two years to give providers time to update their systems to be compliant with the ELD standards. While such regulations could increase the cost of technology, capital equipment and maintenance expenses across our industry, we implemented ELDs company-wide in 2014 prior to the effective date of the ELD standard.\nIn February 2014, President Obama announced that the EPA and the DOT have been ordered to propose additional regulations to reduce exhaust emissions and increase fuel efficiency for heavy-duty trucks manufactured after 2018. The agencies are expected to implement final rules by March 2016, which will build upon the fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks implemented for 2014-2018 model trucks. While the impact of these regulations cannot be ascertained at this time, such regulations could increase the cost of capital equipment and maintenance expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. Costs of compliance with or liabilities for violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are also subject to increasing customer sensitivity to sustainability issues.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, among others. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.\nIn addition, as climate change concerns become more prevalent, federal and local governments and our customers are increasingly sensitive to these issues. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations and customer requirements. We could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements. These costs, changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCSA could adversely affect our results and ability to maintain or grow our business.\nCSA is an enforcement and compliance model required by the FMCSA that involves assessments of a motor carrier\u2019s on-road performance and investigation results for a 24-month period using roadside stops and inspections, resulting in safety and performance ratings in the following categories: unsafe driving; hours-of-service compliance; driver fitness; controlled substances/alcohol; vehicle maintenance; hazardous material compliance; and crash indicators.\nIn January 2016, the FMCSA proposed to revise the current methodology for issuance of a safety fitness determination for motor carriers. The proposed new methodologies would determine when a motor carrier is not fit to operate commercial motor vehicles based on the carrier's on-road safety data in relation to industry data, an investigation or a combination of on-road safety data and investigation information.\nThe CSA evaluations are used to rank carriers and individual drivers and to select carriers for audit and other interventions. While the ultimate impact of CSA is not yet known, it is possible that these measurements could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain drivers which would adversely affect our results and cash flows.\nAnti-terrorism measures may disrupt our business.\nFederal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various anti-terrorism measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. If additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries, we may fail to meet requirements of our customers or incur increased expenses to do so. There can be no assurance that new anti-terrorism measures will not be implemented and that such measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nNumerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability. These factors include the following:\n\u00b7\ncompetition with many other transportation service providers of varying types including competitor LTL carriers and non-asset based logistics and freight brokerage companies, some of which have more equipment, a broader coverage network, a wider range of services and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages;\n\u00b7\ntransportation companies periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during economic recessions or times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or achieve significant growth in our business;\n\u00b7\nmany customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting approved transportation service providers or periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and these practices may depress prices or result in the loss of business;\n\u00b7\nthe trend towards consolidation in the surface transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources than us and other competitive advantages due to their size; and\n\u00b7\nadvances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments.\nOur logistics and brokerage business faces risk from customer concentration and the loss of certain primary customers may have a material adverse effect on those operations.\nOur subsidiaries, Saia TL Plus, MetroGo and LinkEx, are subject to the risk of customer concentration because of the relative importance of their largest customers and the ability of those customers to negotiate aggressive pricing and other customer-favorable terms, including termination for convenience. Many of our competitors in the logistics industry are subject to the same risk. Although we aim to broaden and diversify the customer base of our logistics and brokerage business, a significant portion of our revenue from these subsidiaries is derived from a small number of large and sophisticated customers and a loss of business from, the bankruptcy or insolvency of, or adverse performance by, these major customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Similarly, the renegotiation of these customer contracts may also have an adverse effect on us.\nThe transportation industry is affected by business risks that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nBusinesses operating in the transportation industry are affected by risks that are largely out of their control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. These factors include health of the economy, weather and other seasonal factors, excess capacity in the transportation industry, acts of terrorism, interest rates, fuel costs, fuel taxes, license and registration fees, health care costs and insurance premiums. In particular, harsh weather or acts of terrorism can affect our operations by increasing operational costs, introducing infrastructure instability and disrupting advance route and load planning.\nWe have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms.\nOur business is highly capital intensive. Our net capital expenditures for 2015 were approximately $113 million inclusive of equipment acquired with capital leases. Additionally, we anticipate net capital expenditures in 2016 of approximately $140 million. We depend on cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and operating and capital leases. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms in the future, we may have to limit our growth, enter into less favorable financing arrangements or operate our trucks and trailers for longer periods. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including anticipated volume levels and the price and availability of appropriate-use property for service facilities and newly manufactured tractors. If anticipated service facilities and/or fleet requirements differ materially from actual usage, we may have too much or too little capacity. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder our current credit facilities, we are subject to certain debt covenants and prepayment penalties. Those debt covenants prohibit the payment of dividends, provide limits on our ability to repurchase our stock, and require maintenance of certain maximum leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, among other restrictions, that could limit availability of capital to meet our future growth.\nOur ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control.\nOur credit and debt agreements contain financial and other restrictive covenants and we may be unable to comply with these covenants. A default could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must maintain certain financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit and debt agreements, including among others, covenants requiring maintenance of minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum leverage ratios. If we fail to comply with any of the covenants under our credit and debt agreements, we will be in default under the relevant agreement which could cause cross-defaults under other financial arrangements. In the event of any such default, if we fail to obtain replacement financing, amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangements, our financing sources could cease making further advances, cease issuing letters of credit required under our insurance programs or declare our debt to be immediately due and payable. If acceleration occurs, we may have difficulty in borrowing sufficient additional funds to refinance the accelerated debt or obtain required letters of credit, or we may have to issue securities which would dilute stock ownership. Even if new financing is made available to us, it may not be available on acceptable terms. A default under our credit and debt agreements could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOngoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce and cause volatility to our earnings.\nWe maintain deductibles for claims resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property damage, group health care and workers\u2019 compensation in amounts ranging from $250,000 to $2 million per claim. We also maintain insurance with licensed insurance companies above these self-insured retention limits. If the number or severity of future claims increases, claim expenses might exceed historical levels or could exceed the amounts of our insurance coverage, which could significantly reduce our earnings. Deterioration in safety experience could cause customers to switch business to competitors. Significant increases in insurance premiums as well as the decreased availability of insurance coverage could also impact financial results or cause us to raise our self-insured retentions.\nFurthermore, insurance companies, as well as certain states, require collateral in the form of letters of credit or surety bonds for the estimated exposure of claims within our self-insured retentions. Their estimate of our future exposure as well as external market conditions could influence the amount and costs of additional letters of credit required under our insurance programs and thereby reduce capital available for future growth or adversely affect our results of operations.\nEmployees of Saia are non-union. The ability of Saia to compete could be impaired if operations were to become unionized.\nNone of our employees are currently subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have in the past been the subject of unionization efforts which have been defeated. However, the U.S. Congress could pass labor legislation, such as the formerly proposed Employee Free Choice Act, or the National Labor Relations Board or other federal agencies could issue regulations or administrative changes, which could make it significantly easier for unionization efforts to be successful. If this bill or a variation of it is enacted in the future or if federal regulations regarding labor relations are changed, it could have an adverse impact on our business. While Saia believes its current relationship with its employees is good, there can be no assurance that further unionization efforts will not occur in the future and that such efforts will be defeated. The non-union status of Saia is an important factor in our ability to compete in our markets.\nIf we are unable to retain our key employees, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\nWe depend on the efforts and abilities of our senior management. The future success of our business will continue to depend in part, on our ability to retain our current management team and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management is intense, and, with the exception of Mr. O\u2019Dell, members of our senior management do not have employment agreements. However, members of senior management have non-compete provisions included in their long-term incentive awards. The loss of a member of senior management would require our remaining executive officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to fulfilling the duties of the departing executive and to seeking a replacement. The inability to adequately fill vacancies in our senior management positions on a timely basis could negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy and thus impact our results of operations.\nChanges to our compensation and benefits could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.\nLike other companies, we implemented certain salary and wage cost initiatives in 2009 in response to macro-economic challenges. Such initiatives have been reversed as our financial performance improved. If our salary and wages are not competitive, we may find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business.\nAn increase in the cost of healthcare benefits and administration could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nWe maintain and sponsor health insurance for our employees and their dependents and offer a competitive healthcare program to attract and retain our employees. It is possible that healthcare benefits and administration costs could become increasingly cost prohibitive, either forcing us to make changes to our benefits program or negatively impacting our future profitability.\nThe legislation on healthcare and related regulations could affect the healthcare benefits required to be provided by the Company and cause our compensation costs to increase, adversely affecting our results and cash flows.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and regulations that interpret the law contain provisions which could materially impact the future healthcare costs of the Company. While the legislation\u2019s ultimate impact is not yet known, it is possible that these changes could significantly increase our employee benefits costs which would adversely affect our results and cash flows. Expanded coverage for dependents and elimination of caps on individual maximum expenditures increased the Company\u2019s costs starting in 2011 and in each year since.\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices.\nFuture changes in accounting standards or practices, and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes, may adversely impact public companies in general, the transportation industry or our operations specifically. New accounting standards or requirements, such as a conversion from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to International Financial Reporting Standards, could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and/or liabilities or could be costly to implement. These types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and/or access to capital.\nWe rely heavily on technology to operate our business and cyber-security threats or other disruptions to our technology infrastructure could harm our operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and compete effectively depends in part upon reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide services that are important to our customers. Any disruption to our technology infrastructure (including services provided to us for use in our business by outside providers), including those impacting our computer systems and web site, could adversely impact our customer service and revenues and result in increased costs. While we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully protect us from technology disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur dependence on electronic data storage, automated systems and technology gives rise to cyber-security risks. Although we and our third-party providers have preventive systems and processes in place designed to protect against the risk of system failure and cyber-attacks, a security breach of our systems or those of our third-party providers may cause a disruption of our business or the loss of information and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations.\nIncreased usage of social media poses reputational risks.\nAs use of social media becomes more prevalent, our susceptibility to risks related to social media increases. While we have implemented a social media policy to provide our employees with guidance for sharing information over social media in a way that is beneficial to us, the immediacy of social media precludes us from having real-time control over postings made regarding us via social media, whether matters of fact or opinion. Information distributed via social media could result in immediate unfavorable publicity for which we, like our competitors, do not have the ability to reverse. This unfavorable publicity could result in damage to our reputation and therefore negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nCertain provisions of our governing documents and Delaware law could have anti-takeover effects.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain provisions which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. Such provisions include, for example, provisions classifying our Board of Directors, a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent, authorization of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock in series with the terms of each series to be fixed by the Board of Directors and an advance notice procedure for shareholder proposals and nominations to the Board of Directors. These provisions may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts.\nWe may not make future acquisitions or, if we do, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nWe may make additional acquisitions in the future. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, consummating or integrating any future acquisitions. Additionally, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions. Each acquisition has numerous risks including:\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company or unanticipated costs to support new business lines or separate legal entities;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of our ongoing business, distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues;\n\u00b7\nadditional indebtedness or the issuance of additional equity to finance future acquisitions, which could be dilutive to our shareholders;\n\u00b7\npotential loss of key customers or employees of acquired companies;\n\u00b7\ntemporary depression in prices we charge certain customers in order to match existing customer pricing in the acquired company\u2019s markets;\n\u00b7\ninability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\n\u00b7\nimpairment charges associated with goodwill representing operational synergies and future economic benefits that are not individually identified and separately recognized and other acquired intangible assets; and\n\u00b7\npotential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with legal and financial contingencies, among other things.\nIn the event that the integrations are not successfully completed, there could be a material adverse effect on us.\nWe face litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business.\nWe face litigation regarding a variety of issues, including without limitation, alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws, securities laws and accidents involving our trucks and employees. These proceedings may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. The defense of such lawsuits could result in significant expense and the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business. Some or all of the amount we may be required to pay to defend or to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any or all of these proceedings may not be covered by insurance and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf we raise additional capital in the future, stockholders\u2019 ownership in us could be diluted.\nAny issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline, or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past, which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive. If we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities, these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to those of common shareholders, which could impair the value of our common stock.\nWe face risks related to the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to pay for services.\nIf one or more of our customers experiences financial difficulties, including filing for bankruptcy, it may negatively affect our business due to the decreased demand for our services from these customers, or the potential inability of these companies to make full payment on amounts owed to us. Customer bankruptcies also entail the risk of potential recovery by the bankruptcy estate of amounts previously paid to us that are deemed a preference under bankruptcy laws. We do not carry insurance against the risk of customer default on their payment obligations to us or against bankruptcy preference claims. The risks associated with these matters will likely increase in the event of an economic downturn. The loss of revenue from these customers or payment of preference claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market constantly changes. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate and the fluctuations may be unrelated to our financial performance. Our share price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nActual or anticipated variations in our earnings, financial or operating performance or liquidity, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nChanges in recommendations or projections of research analysts who follow our stock or the stock of other companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nFailure to meet the earnings projections of research analysts who follow our stock;\n\u00b7\nChanges in general economic and capital market conditions, including general market price declines or market volatility;\n\u00b7\nReactions to our regulatory filings and announcements related to our business;\n\u00b7\nOperating and stock performance of other companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nActions by government regulators;\n\u00b7\nLitigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u00b7\nNews reports or trends, concerns and other issues related to us or our industry, including changes in regulations; and\n\u00b7\nOther factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome resulting from these risks and uncertainties.", "PERMNO": 89506, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "SAIA"}
