RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are subject to demand fluctuations in the housing industry. Any reduction in demand would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDemand for our homes and rental apartments is subject to fluctuations, often due to factors outside of our control, such as employment levels, consumer confidence and spending, housing demand, availability of financing for homebuyers, interest rates, availability and prices of new homes compared to existing inventory, and demographic trends. In a housing market downturn, our sales and results of operations will be adversely affected; we may have significant inventory impairments and other write-offs; our gross margins may decline significantly from historical levels; and we may incur substantial losses from operations. At any particular time, we cannot accurately predict whether housing market conditions will improve, deteriorate or continue as they exist at that time.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in markets where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of our homes live could reduce the demand for homes and, as a result, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in markets where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of our homes live have had and may in the future have a negative impact on our business. Adverse changes in mortgage interest rates, employment levels, job growth, consumer confidence, perceptions regarding the strength of the housing market, and population growth, or an oversupply of homes for sale may reduce demand or depress prices for our homes and cause home buyers to cancel their agreements to purchase our homes. This, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant inflation, higher interest rates or deflation could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials and labor, and interest rates. All of these factors can have a negative impact on housing affordability. In a highly inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the sales prices of our homes at or above the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. In addition, our cost of capital, labor and materials can increase, which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results. For example, the current and continued macro-economic conditions of high inflation and rising interest rates, especially the steep increases in mortgage rates during 2022, is one of the primary drivers behind the overall decrease in demand for new homes since our second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nConversely, deflation could cause an overall decrease in spending and borrowing capacity, which could lead to deterioration in economic conditions and employment levels. Deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes. These, or other factors that increase the risk of significant deflation, could have a negative impact on our business or financial results.\nThe risks associated with our land, lot and rental inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThere are substantial risks inherent in controlling, owning and developing land. If housing demand declines, we may not be able to build, sell or rent homes profitably in some of our communities, we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own, and we may forfeit deposits on land that we put under control through option arrangements. We acquire land or make payments to control land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within existing markets. If housing demand in a given market declines below the levels that we expected when we acquired or gained control of land, we may have to sell or rent homes or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots. Due to the decline in our business during the 2006-2011 downturn in the housing industry, we recognized significant inventory impairments. We cannot assure you that significant inventory impairments will not occur again in the future.\nIf land is not available at reasonable prices, our sales and results of operations could decrease.\nIn the long term, our operations depend on our ability to obtain land at reasonable prices for the development of our residential communities. At October 31, 2022, we had approximately 76,000 home sites that we owned or controlled through options. In the future, changes in the availability of land, competition for available land, availability of financing to acquire land, zoning regulations that limit housing density, and other market conditions may hurt our ability to obtain land for new residential communities at acceptable prices. If the supply of land appropriate for the development of our residential communities becomes more limited because of these factors or for any other reason, the cost of land could increase and/or the number of homes that we are able to sell and build could be reduced.\nOur ability to execute on our business strategies is uncertain, and we may be unable to achieve our goals.\nWe cannot guarantee that (i) our strategies, which include expanding our geographic footprint, product lines and price points, and becoming a more capital and operationally efficient home builder, and any related initiatives or actions (including home builder acquisitions), will be successful or that they will generate growth, earnings or returns at any particular level or within any particular time frame; (ii) in the future we will achieve positive operational or financial results or results in any particular metric or measure equal to or better than those attained in the past; or (iii) we will perform in any period as well as other home builders. We also cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to maintain our strategies, and any related initiatives or actions, in the future and, due to unexpectedly favorable or unfavorable market conditions or other factors, we may determine that we need to adjust, refine or abandon all or portions of our strategies, and any related initiatives or actions, though we cannot guarantee that any such adjustments will be successful. The failure of any one or more of our present strategies, or any related initiatives or actions, or the failure of any adjustments that we may pursue or implement, would likely have an adverse\neffect on our ability to increase the value and profitability of our business; on our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course; on our overall liquidity; and on our consolidated financial statements, and the effect, in each case, could be material.\nNegative publicity could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.\nOur business is dependent upon the appeal of the Toll Brothers brand, and its association with quality and luxury is integral to our success. Our strategy includes growing our business by expanding our luxury brand to new price points, product lines and geographies, including expansion of our affordable luxury products. If we are unable to maintain the position of the Toll Brothers brand, our business may be adversely affected by diminishing the distinctive appeal of the brand and tarnishing its image. This could result in lower sales and earnings.\nIn addition, unfavorable media or investor and analyst reports related to our industry, company, brand, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance, or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business, regardless of its accuracy. Furthermore, the speed at which negative publicity is disseminated has increased dramatically through the use of electronic communication, including social media outlets, websites and other digital platforms. Our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment. Adverse publicity or negative commentary from any media outlets could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe can also be affected by poor relations with the residents of communities we develop because efforts made by us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities, or in connection with the transition of a homeowners association, could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation. In addition, we could decide or be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes, which could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues and income from operations is generated from California.\nA significant portion of our revenues and income from operations are concentrated in California. Factors beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and/or income from operations generated in California. These factors include, but are not limited to: changes in the regulatory and fiscal environment; prolonged economic downturns; high levels of foreclosures; lack of affordability; a decline in foreign buyer demand; severe weather including drought; the risk of local governments imposing building moratoriums and of state or local governments imposing regulations that increase building costs; natural disasters such as earthquakes and wild fires; environmental incidents; and declining population and/or growth rates and the related reduction in housing demand in this region. If home sale activity or sales prices decline in California, our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and our inventory and lots owned or controlled in the state may be at risk of impairment. As a result, our consolidated financial results may be adversely affected.\nIn the construction of a mid-rise, high-rise or multifamily building, whether a for-sale or a for-rent property, we incur significant costs before we can begin construction, sell and deliver the units to our customers, or commence the collection of rent and recover our costs. We may be subject to delays in construction that could lead to higher costs that could adversely affect our operating results. Changing market conditions during the construction period could negatively impact sales prices and rents, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nBefore a mid-rise, high-rise or multifamily building generates any revenues, we make significant expenditures to acquire land; to obtain permits, development approvals, and entitlements; and to construct the building. It generally takes several years for us to acquire the land and construct, market, and deliver units or lease units in a high-rise building. Completion times vary on a building-by-building basis depending on the complexity of the project, its stage of development when acquired, our relationship with any joint venture partners that may be involved in a project, and the regulatory and community issues involved. As a result of these potential delays in the completion of a building, we face the risk that demand for housing may decline during this period and we may be forced to sell or lease units at a loss or for prices that generate lower profit margins than we initially anticipated. Furthermore, if construction is delayed, we may face increased costs as a result of inflation or other causes and/or asset carrying costs (including interest on funds used to acquire the land and construct the building). These costs can be significant and can adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if values of the building or units decline, we may also be required to recognize material write-downs of the book value of the building in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nIncreases in cancellations of existing agreements of sale could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur backlog reflects agreements of sale with our home buyers for homes that have not yet been delivered. We have received a deposit from our home buyer for each home reflected in our backlog, and generally we have the right to retain the deposit if the home buyer does not complete the purchase. In some cases, however, a home buyer may cancel the agreement of sale and receive a complete or partial refund of the deposit for reasons such as state and local law requirements, the home buyer\u2019s\ninability to obtain mortgage financing, the home buyer\u2019s inability to sell their current home, or our inability to complete and deliver the home within the specified time. Home buyers may also choose to cancel their home agreement and forfeit their deposit. At October 31, 2022, we had 8,098 homes with a sales value of $8.87 billion in backlog. If economic conditions decline, if mortgage financing becomes less available, or if our homes become less attractive due to market price declines or due to other conditions at or in the vicinity of our communities, we could experience an increase in home buyers canceling their agreements of sale with us, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe home building industry is highly competitive, and, if other home builders are more successful or offer better value to our customers, our business could decline.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment in which we face competition from a number of other home builders in each market in which we operate. We compete with large national and regional home building companies and with smaller local home builders for land, financing, building components, and skilled management and labor resources. We also compete with the resale home market, also referred to as the \u201cpreviously owned\u201d or \u201cexisting\u201d home market. An oversupply of homes available for sale or the heavy discounting of home prices by some of our competitors could adversely affect demand for our homes and the results of our operations. An increase in competitive conditions can have any of the following impacts on us: delivery of fewer homes; sale of fewer homes; higher cancellations by our home buyers; an increase in selling incentives and/or reduction of prices; and realization of lower gross margins due to lower sales prices or an inability to increase sales prices to offset increased costs of the homes delivered. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business could decline disproportionately to that of our competitors.\nWe rely on subcontractors to develop our land and construct our homes and on building supply companies to supply components for the construction of our homes. The failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes and adopt appropriate jobsite safety practices or defects in the components we obtain from building supply companies could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe engage subcontractors to develop our land and construct our homes, including by purchasing components used in the construction of our homes from building supply companies. Despite our quality control and jobsite safety efforts, we may discover that our subcontractors were engaging in improper development, construction or safety practices or that the components purchased from building supply companies are not performing as specified. The occurrence of such events could require us to repair facilities and homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law, or to respond to claims of improper oversight of construction sites. The cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant, and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors, suppliers and insurers. For example, we have incurred or expect to incur significant costs to repair homes built in Pennsylvania and Delaware. See Note 7 - \u201cAccrued Expenses\u201d in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding warranty charges.\nWe participate in certain joint ventures where we may be adversely impacted by the failure of the joint venture or its participants to fulfill their obligations.\nWe have investments in and commitments to certain joint ventures with unrelated parties. These joint ventures generally borrow money to help finance their activities. In certain circumstances, the joint venture participants, including us, are required to provide guarantees of certain obligations relating to the joint ventures. In most of these joint ventures, we do not have a controlling interest and, as a result, are not able to require these joint ventures or their participants to honor their obligations or renegotiate them on acceptable terms. If the joint ventures or their participants do not honor their obligations, we may be required to expend additional resources or suffer losses, which could be significant.\nGovernment regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our communities, increase our expenses, or limit our home building activities, which could have a negative impact on our operations.\nWe must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities in connection with our development activities, and these governmental authorities often have broad discretion in exercising their approval authority. We incur substantial costs related to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Any increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs or, in some cases, cause us to determine that the property is not feasible for development.\nVarious local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning building, zoning, sales, accessibility, safety, anti-discrimination, and similar matters apply to and/or affect the housing industry. Governmental regulation affects construction activities as well as sales activities, mortgage lending activities, and other dealings with home buyers, including anti-discrimination laws such as the Fair Housing Act and data privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. The industry also has experienced an increase in state and local legislation and regulations that limit the availability or use of land. Municipalities may also restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. In some areas, municipalities may enact growth control initiatives, which will restrict the number of building permits available in a given year. In addition, we may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of\nchanges in local circumstances or applicable law. If municipalities in which we operate take actions like these, it could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays, increasing our costs, or limiting our ability to operate in those municipalities. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.\nOur mortgage subsidiary, TBMC, is subject to various state and federal statutes, rules, and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations, and other areas of mortgage origination and financing. The impact of those statutes, rules, and regulations can increase our home buyers\u2019 cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, and restrict our home buyers\u2019 access to some types of loans.\nProduct liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs a home builder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the home building industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high, and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies is limited. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly. If the limits or coverages of our current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or we are not able to obtain adequate, or reasonably priced, insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, we may experience losses that could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe record expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover our self-insured liability under our insurance policies and estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above our coverage limits or that are not covered by our insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of our historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The projection of losses related to these liabilities requires actuarial assumptions that are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build, insurance industry practices, and legal or regulatory actions and/or interpretations, among other factors. Key assumptions used in these estimates include claim frequencies, severities, and settlement patterns, which can occur over an extended period of time. In addition, changes in the frequency and severity of reported claims and the estimates to settle claims can impact the trends and assumptions used in the actuarial analysis, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Due to the degree of judgment required and the potential for variability in these underlying assumptions, our actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nOver the past several years, we have had a significant number of water intrusion claims related to homes we built in Pennsylvania and Delaware. See Note 7 - \u201cAccrued Expenses\u201d in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these warranty charges.\nOur condominium and rental multi-unit buildings are subject to fluctuations in delivery volume due to their extended construction time, levels of pre-sales and lease-up, and quick delivery of units once buildings are complete.\nOur quarterly operating results will fluctuate depending on the timing of completion of construction of our multi-unit condominium buildings, levels of pre-sales, and the relatively short delivery time of the pre-sold units once the building is completed. These sales can result in significant gains or losses that we recognize on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as income from unconsolidated entities. The timing of these gains or losses cannot be predicted with certainty and, as a result, can cause our net income to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nIn addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop, operate and, in certain situations, sell for-rent apartments, which we accomplish mainly through joint ventures. Often, the joint venture through which we develop and lease-up a rental property sells the property to a third party or to the joint venture partner upon stabilization. These sales can result in significant gains or losses that we recognize on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as income from unconsolidated entities. The timing of these gains or losses cannot be predicted with certainty and, as a result, can cause our net income to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to the seasonal nature of our business.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate with the seasons; normally, a significant portion of our agreements of sale are entered into with customers in the winter and spring months. Construction of one of our homes typically proceeds after signing the agreement of sale with our customer and typically require 9 to 12 months to complete, although recently construction times have extended beyond 12 months in many communities due to a variety of reasons, including high demand, labor shortages, supply chain disruption and municipal related delays. In addition, weather-related events may occur from time to time, delaying starts or closings or increasing costs and reducing profitability. In addition, delays in opening new communities or new sections\nof existing communities could have an adverse impact on home sales and revenues. Expenses are not incurred and recognized evenly throughout the year. Because of these factors, our quarterly operating results may be uneven and may be marked by lower revenues and earnings in some quarters than in others.\nIncreases in taxes or government fees could increase our costs, and adverse changes in tax laws or their interpretation could reduce demand for our homes and negatively affect our operating results.\nIncreases in real estate taxes and other local government fees, such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open space, and road improvements, and/or provide low- and moderate-income housing, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, increases in local real estate taxes could adversely affect our potential home buyers, who may consider those costs in determining whether to make a new home purchase and decide, as a result, not to purchase one of our homes.\nChanges in tax laws could reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives for homeowners and could make housing less affordable or otherwise reduce the demand for housing, which in turn could reduce our sales and hurt our results of operations. Further, while we believe that our recorded tax balances are adequate, it is not possible to predict the effects of possible changes in the tax laws or changes in their interpretation and whether they could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. We have filed our tax returns in prior years based upon certain filing positions we believe are appropriate. If the Internal Revenue Service or state taxing authorities disagree with these filing positions, we may owe additional taxes, which could be material.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which may cause us to incur additional operating expenses, subject us to longer construction cycle times, or result in material fines or harm to our reputation.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment, including those regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, the management of storm water runoff at construction sites, the handling, use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, impacts to wetlands and other sensitive environments, and the remediation of contamination at properties that we own or develop. In addition, state and local jurisdictions have in recent years enacted regulations that require new homes to be more energy efficient than existing homes, or have mandated energy efficient features, such as solar panels, be included in new construction. The environmental regulations applicable to each community in which we operate vary greatly depending on the location of the community site, the site's environmental conditions and the present and former use of the site. Environmental regulations may cause delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation or other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and home building activity. In addition, noncompliance with these regulations could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocations or other sanctions; and contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments, whether or not we were responsible for such conditions, may result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage or other losses.\nFrom time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and other federal or state agencies review home builders' compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs or harm our reputation. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on home builders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain building components such as lumber.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of state and Federal laws and regulations have been enacted or proposed that deal with the effect of climate change on the environment. These laws and regulations, which are generally intended to directly or indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve water or limit other potential climate change impacts, may impose restrictions or additional requirements on land development and home construction in certain areas. Such restrictions and requirements could increase our operating and compliance costs or require additional technology and capital investment, which could adversely affect our results of operations. This is a particular concern in the western United States, where some of the most extensive and stringent environmental laws and residential building construction standards in the country have been enacted, and where we have significant business operations. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing climate-related government regulations applicable to our business, and such compliance has not had a material impact on our business. However, given the rapidly changing nature of environmental laws and matters that may arise that are not currently known, we cannot predict our future exposure concerning such matters, and our future costs to achieve compliance or remedy potential violations could be significant.\nAdditionally, increased governmental and societal attention to environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, labor and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control,\nassess and report. These factors may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to adequately address such ESG matters or fail to comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results.\nFailure by our employees or representatives to comply with laws and regulations may harm us.\nWe are required to comply with laws and regulations that govern all aspects of our business including land acquisition, development, home construction, labor and employment, mortgage origination, title and escrow operations, sales, and warranty. It is possible that our employees or entities engaged by us, such as subcontractors, could intentionally or unintentionally violate some of these laws and regulations. Although we endeavor to take immediate action if we become aware of such violations, we may incur fines or penalties as a result of these actions and our reputation with governmental agencies and our customers could be damaged.\nComponent shortages and increased costs of labor and supplies are beyond our control and can result in delays and increased costs to develop our communities.\nOur ability to develop residential communities may be adversely affected by circumstances beyond our control, including work stoppages, labor disputes, and shortages of qualified trades people, such as carpenters, roofers, masons, electricians, and plumbers; changes in laws relating to union organizing activity; lack of availability of adequate utility infrastructure and services; our need to rely on local subcontractors who may not be adequately capitalized or insured; the ability of municipalities to process permits, conduct inspections and take similar actions in a timely manner; and shortages, delays in availability, or fluctuations in prices of building components and materials. Any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of, or could increase the cost of, developing one or more of our residential communities. We may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising our home prices because the price for each home is typically set months prior to its delivery pursuant to the agreement of sale with the home buyer. If that happens, our operating results could be harmed.\nOver the past several years, strong demand for homes combined with supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and municipal related delays has caused our construction cycle to lengthen and the costs of building materials to increase. Longer construction cycles can lead to increased cancellation rates. In addition, shortages and cost increases in building materials and tightness in the labor market can erode our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations, especially if such disruptions, shortages and delays persist for extended periods of time.\nWe are subject to one collective bargaining agreement that covers less than 2% of our employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages due to strikes by unionized workers, but we cannot make assurances that there will not be any work stoppages due to strikes or other job actions in the future. We engage independent contractors that employ non-unionized workers to construct our homes. At any given point in time, the employees of those subcontractors, who are not yet represented by a union, may be unionized.\nWe are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, and challenges with the implementation of the system may impact our business and operations.\nWe are in the midst of a multi-year process of implementing a complex new enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d). The ERP implementation requires the integration of the new ERP with multiple new and existing information systems and business processes, and has been designed to accurately maintain our books and records and provide information to our management teams important to the operation of the business. Our ERP implementation will continue to require ongoing investment. If the system as it currently stands or after necessary investments does not result in our ability to maintain accurate books and records, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Additionally, conversion from our old system to the ERP may cause inefficiencies until the ERP is stabilized and mature. The implementation of our ERP mandated new procedures and many new controls over financial reporting. These procedures and controls are not yet mature in their operation and not fully tested by our internal auditors. If we are unable to adequately implement and maintain procedures and controls relating to our ERP, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired and impact our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness and Financing\nIf we are not able to obtain suitable financing, or if the interest rates on our debt are increased, or if our credit ratings are lowered, our business and results of operations may decline.\nOur business and results of operations depend substantially on our ability to obtain financing, whether from bank borrowings or from financing in the public debt markets. Substantial portions of our revolving credit facility, which provides for approximately $1.90 billion in committed borrowing capacity, and our $650.0 million term loan mature in November 2026,\nwith smaller portions maturing in November 2025. In addition, $400.0 million of our senior notes become due and payable in April 2023 and $1.60 billion of our senior notes become due and payable at various times from November 2025 through November 2029. We cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find additional sources of financing in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nIf we are not able to obtain suitable financing at reasonable terms or replace existing debt and credit facilities when they become due or expire, our costs for borrowings may increase and our revenues may decrease or we could be precluded from continuing our operations at current levels.\nIncreases in interest rates can make it more difficult and/or expensive for us to obtain the funds we need to operate our business. The amount of interest we incur on our revolving bank credit facility and term loan (exclusive of the amount we have hedged with interest rate swap transactions as further described in Note 6 - \u201cLoans Payable, Senior Notes, and Mortgage Company Loan Facility\u201d in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K) fluctuates based on changes in short-term interest rates and the amount of borrowings we incur. Increases in interest rates generally and/or any downgrade in the ratings that national rating agencies assign to our outstanding debt securities could increase the interest rates we must pay on any subsequent issuances of debt securities, and any such ratings downgrade could also make it more difficult for us to sell such debt securities.\nIf home buyers are not able to obtain suitable financing, our results of operations may decline.\nOur results of operations also depend on the ability of our potential home buyers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes. Mortgage rates increased significantly during fiscal 2022, which has impacted the demand for our homes during the second half of fiscal 2022, and market conditions and/or government actions could cause mortgage rates to increase even further in the future. Any uncertainty in the mortgage markets and its impact on the overall mortgage market, including the tightening of credit standards, future increases in the effective cost of home mortgage financing (including as a result of changes to federal tax law), and increased government regulation, could adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for a home purchase, thus preventing our potential home buyers from purchasing our homes. In addition, where our potential home buyers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us, increases in mortgage costs and/or lack of availability of mortgages could prevent the buyers of our potential home buyers\u2019 existing homes from obtaining the mortgages they need to complete their purchases, which would result in our potential home buyers\u2019 inability to buy a home from us. Similar risks apply to those buyers whose contracts are in our backlog of homes to be delivered. If our home buyers, potential buyers, or buyers of our home buyers\u2019 current homes cannot obtain suitable financing, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our ability to resell mortgages to investors is impaired, our home buyers may be required to find alternative financing.\nGenerally, when our mortgage subsidiary closes a mortgage for a home buyer at a previously locked-in rate, it already has an agreement in place with an investor to acquire the mortgage following the closing. Our mortgage loans are sold to investors with limited recourse provisions derived from industry-standard representations and warranties in the relevant agreements. These representations and warranties primarily involve the absence of misrepresentations by the borrower or other parties, the appropriate underwriting of the loan and in some cases, a required minimum number of payments to be made by the borrower. We generally do not retain any other continuing interest related to mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. However, if these recourse provisions are not satisfied, the mortgage loans sold to investors could be returned to us. In addition, if the resale market for our mortgages decline or the underwriting standards of our investors become more stringent, our ability to sell future mortgage loans could be adversely affected and either we would have to commit our own funds to long-term investments in mortgage loans, which could, among other things, delay the time when we recognize revenues from home sales on our statements of operations, or our home buyers would be required to find an alternative source of financing. If our home buyers cannot obtain another source of financing in order to purchase our homes, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Other Events and Factors\nPublic health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public health and public perception of health risk. In 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, resulting in federal, state and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions, including the closures of non-essential businesses for a period of time. These restrictions had an adverse impact on our business in the spring of 2020. However, following the initial onset of the pandemic, economic activity resumed and demand for our homes improved significantly in the remainder of fiscal 2020 and remained strong through the first half of fiscal 2022. The effects of the pandemic on economic activity, combined with the strong demand for new homes, caused many disruptions to our supply chain\nand shortages in certain building components and materials, as well as labor shortages. These conditions caused our construction cycles to lengthen.\nThere is continuing uncertainty regarding how long the impacts of COVID-19 will affect the U.S. economy and our supply chain and operations. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including whether there is a resurgence in the pandemic and whether variant strains emerge, and the extent of any containment or mitigation measures on our customers, trade partners and employees, all of which are highly uncertain, unpredictable and outside our control. If COVID-19 or any of its variants continues to have a significant negative impact on the economy, or if a new pandemic emerges, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and other conditions could disrupt the development of our communities, which could harm our sales and results of operations.\nAdverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, droughts, and wildfires, can have serious effects on our ability to develop our residential communities. We also may be affected by unforeseen engineering, environmental, or geological conditions or problems, including conditions or problems which arise on lands of third parties in the vicinity of our communities, but nevertheless negatively impact our communities. Any of these adverse events or circumstances could cause delays in or prevent the completion of, or increase the cost of, developing one or more of our residential communities and, as a result, could harm our sales and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIncreased domestic or international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nIncreased domestic or international instability could adversely impact the economy and significantly reduce demand for homes and the number of new contracts we sign, increase the number of cancellations of existing contracts, and/or increase our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe could be adversely impacted by the loss of key management personnel or if we fail to attract qualified personnel.\nOur future success depends, to a significant degree, on the efforts of our senior management and our ability to attract qualified personnel. Our operations could be adversely affected if key members of our senior management leave the Company or we cannot attract qualified personnel to manage our business.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities as well as maintain our business records, including information provided by our customers. Many of these resources are provided to us and/or maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify certain security and service level standards. Our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if these resources are compromised, degraded, damaged or fail, whether due to a virus or other harmful circumstance, intentional breach or disruption of our information technology resources by a third party, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption, failure or error (including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions (including the failure to follow our security protocols), or lost connectivity to our networked resources. A significant and extended disruption in the functioning of these resources could impair our operations, damage our reputation, and cause us to lose customers, sales and revenue.\nIn addition, breaches of our data security systems, including by cyber-attacks, could result in the unintended public disclosure or the misappropriation of our proprietary information or personal and confidential information, about our employees, consumers who view our homes, home buyers, mortgage loan applicants and business partners, requiring us to incur significant expense to address and resolve these kinds of issues. The release of confidential information may lead to identity theft and related fraud, litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals and/or business partners and/or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Depending on its nature, a particular breach or series of breaches of our systems may result in the unauthorized use, appropriation or loss of confidential or proprietary information on a one-time or continuing basis, which may not be detected for a period of time. In addition, the costs of maintaining adequate protection against such threats, as they develop in the future (or as legal requirements related to data security increase) could be material.\nIn recent years, we have been subject to cyber incidents including an attack that temporarily disrupted access to certain of our systems and an incident involving identity theft through the unauthorized access of one of our third-party service provider\u2019s information systems. Neither of these incidents individually or in the aggregate resulted in any material liability to us, any\nmaterial damage to our reputation, or any material disruption to our operations. However, as a result of a widespread increase in the frequency and number of cyber-attacks, we expect that we will continue to be the target of additional and increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and data security breaches, and the safeguards we have designed to help prevent these incidents from occurring may not be successful. Any further increase in the frequency or scope of cyber-attacks may exacerbate these data security risks. If we experience additional cyber-attacks or data security breaches in the future, we could suffer material liabilities, our reputation could be materially damaged, and our operations could be materially disrupted.", "PERMNO": 70228, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "TOL"}
