The discussion below addresses the material risks and uncertainties, of which the Company is currently aware, that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Other risks that the Company does not know about now, or that the Company does not currently believe are significant, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business or the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities. See additional discussions about credit, interest rate, market, and litigation risks in \"Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nRisks Relating to the Company's Business\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates and in the U.S. as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, government shutdowns, the imposition of tariffs on trade, natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, terrorist attacks, acts of war, or a combination of these or other factors. The specific impact on the Company of many of these factors is difficult to predict, could be long or short term, and may be indirect, such as disruptions in our customers' supply chain or a reduction in the demand for their products or services. A worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which the Company conducts business could have adverse effects, including the following:\n\u2022\na decrease in deposit balances or the demand for loans and other products and services the Company offers;\n\u2022\nan increase in the number of borrowers who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Company, which could lead to higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and provisions for credit losses;\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of loans and other assets or in the value of collateral;\n\u2022\na decrease in net interest income from the Company\u2019s lending and deposit gathering activities;\n\u2022\nan impairment of certain intangible assets such as goodwill; and\n\u2022\nan increase in competition resulting from increasing consolidation within the financial services industry.\nIn the U.S. financial services industry, the commercial soundness of financial institutions is closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as \u201csystemic risk\u201d and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms, and exchanges, with which the Company interacts on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect the Company.\nIt is possible that the business environment in the U.S. will experience volatility in the future. There can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term or that conditions will not worsen. Such conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company is highly dependent on real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market will hurt the Company\u2019s business and earnings.\nThe Company is located in areas in which economic growth is largely dependent on the real estate market, and a majority of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by or otherwise dependent on real estate. The market for real estate is cyclical and the outlook for this sector is uncertain. A decline in real estate activity would likely cause a decline in asset and deposit growth and negatively impact the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and industrial and CRE loans, which contain concentrations in certain business lines or product types that have unique risk characteristics and may expose the Company to increased lending risks.\nThe Company\u2019s loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and industrial and CRE loans, which contain material concentrations in certain business lines or product types, such as mortgage warehouse, real estate, corporate finance, municipal and nonprofit loans, as well as in specific business sectors such as technology and innovation. These loan concentrations present unique risks and involve specialized underwriting and management as they often involve large loan balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship may adversely affect the Company. In addition, based on the nature of lending to these specialty markets, repayment of loans may be dependent upon borrowers receiving additional equity financing or, in some cases, a successful sale to a third party, public offering, or other form of liquidity event. Unforeseen adverse events, changes in regulatory policy, or a general decline in the borrower's industry may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the inherent risk associated with accounting estimates, the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses may be insufficient, which could require the Company to raise additional capital or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the Company\u2019s consolidated loan portfolio and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based on a number of factors, including the size of the portfolio, asset classifications, economic trends, industry experience and trends, industry and geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, management\u2019s assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio, historical loan loss experience, and loan underwriting policies. In addition, the Company evaluates all loans identified as problem loans and augments the allowance based upon its estimation of the potential loss associated with those problem loans. Additions to the allowance for credit losses recorded through the Company\u2019s provision for credit losses decrease the Company\u2019s net income. If such assumptions and judgments are incorrect, the Company\u2019s actual credit losses may exceed the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company's allowance for credit losses and loss contingency on unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is $167.8 million and $9.0 million, respectively. Deterioration in the real estate market or general economic conditions could affect the ability of the Company\u2019s loan customers to service their debt, which could result in additional loan provisions and increases in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses. In addition, the Company may be required to record additional loan provisions or increase the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses based on new information regarding existing loans, input from regulators in connection with their review of the Company\u2019s allowance, changes in regulatory guidance, regulations or accounting standards, identification of additional problem loans, changes in economic outlook, and other factors, both within and outside of the Company\u2019s management\u2019s control. Moreover, because future events are uncertain and because the Company may not successfully identify all deteriorating loans in a timely manner, there may be loans that deteriorate in an accelerated time frame.\nAny increases in the provision or allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in the Company\u2019s net income and, potentially, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. If actual credit losses materially exceed the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses, the Company may be required to raise additional capital, which may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. The Company\u2019s inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and capital.\nRecent changes to the FASB accounting standards will result in a significant change to the Company\u2019s recognition of credit losses and may materially impact the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nThe incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses was replaced with an expected loss model referred to as CECL, which became effective on January 1, 2020 and will be reported in the Company's first quarter 2020 financial results. Under the incurred loss model, the Company delays recognition of losses until it is probable that a loss has been incurred. The CECL model represents a dramatic departure from the incurred loss model. The CECL model requires the Company to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. Additionally, the measurement of expected credit losses will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet (with periodic updates thereafter) and will be based on current conditions, information about past events, including historical experience, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that impact the collectability of the reported amount. As such, the CECL model will materially impact how the Company determines its ACL and the Company\u2019s ACL may experience more fluctuations under the CECL model, which may result in significant volatility in the provision for credit losses and, therefore, earnings. Upon transition from the incurred loss model to the CECL model, on January 1, 2020, the Company recognized an increase to its allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded loan commitments of $19 million and $15 million, respectively, and established\nan allowance of $3 million on its HTM securities. These increases resulted in a one-time cumulative adjustment to retained earnings of $25 million, which is net of related tax effects.\nThe Company could be subject to tax audits, challenges to its tax positions, or adverse changes or interpretations of tax laws.\nThe Company is subject to federal and applicable state income tax laws and regulations. Income tax laws and regulations are often complex and require significant judgment in determining the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. The Company\u2019s determination of its tax liability is subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Any audits or challenges of such determinations may adversely affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition.\nU.S. tax legislation enacted in late 2017 made significant changes to federal tax law, including the taxation of corporations, by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate, disallowing certain deductions that had previously been allowed, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. Further changes in tax laws, changes in interpretations, guidance or regulations that may be promulgated, or challenges to judgments or actions that the Company may take with respect to tax laws could negatively impact the Company's business.\nBecause of the geographic concentration of the Company\u2019s assets, changes in local economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is primarily concentrated in selected markets in Arizona, California, and Nevada. As a result of this geographic concentration, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. Deterioration in economic conditions in these markets could result in one or more of the following: an increase in loan delinquencies and charge-offs; an increase in problem assets and foreclosures; a decrease in the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services; or a decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate.\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments expose the Company to certain market risks and may increase the volatility of earnings and AOCI.\nThe Company holds certain financial instruments measured at fair value. For those financial instruments measured at fair value, the Company is required to recognize the changes in the fair value of such instruments in earnings or AOCI each quarter. Therefore, any increases or decreases in the fair value of these financial instruments have a corresponding impact on reported earnings or AOCI. Fair value can be affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the Company\u2019s credit position, interest rate volatility, capital markets volatility, and other economic factors. Accordingly, the Company is subject to mark-to-market risk and the application of fair value accounting may cause the Company\u2019s earnings and AOCI to be more volatile than would be suggested by the Company\u2019s underlying performance.\nIf the Company loses a significant portion of its core deposits or a significant deposit relationship, or its cost of funding deposits increases significantly, the Company's liquidity and/or profitability would be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its current obligations and support loan growth and, specifically, to attract and retain a stable base of relatively low-cost deposits. The competition for these deposits in the Company's markets is strong and customers may demand higher interest rates on their deposits or seek other investments offering higher rates of return. The Company offers reciprocal deposit products, through third party networks to customers seeking federal insurance for deposit amounts that exceed the applicable deposit insurance limit at a single institution. The Company also from time to time offers other credit enhancements to depositors, such as FHLB letters of credit and, for certain deposits of public monies, pledges of collateral in the form of readily marketable securities. Any event or circumstance that interferes with or limits the Company's ability to offer these products to customers that require greater security for their deposits, such as a significant regulatory enforcement action or a significant decline in capital levels at the Company's bank subsidiary, could negatively impact the Company's ability to attract and retain deposits. If the Company were to lose a significant deposit relationship or a significant portion of its low-cost deposits, the Company would be required to borrow from other sources at higher rates and the Company's liquidity and profitability would be adversely impacted.\nFrom time to time, the Company has utilized borrowings from the FHLB and the FRB, and there can be no assurance these programs will be available as needed.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has no borrowings from the FHLB of San Francisco or the FRB. However, in the past, the Company has utilized borrowings from the FHLB of San Francisco and the FRB to satisfy its short-term liquidity needs. The Company\u2019s borrowing capacity is generally dependent on the value of its collateral pledged to these entities. These lenders could reduce the Company\u2019s borrowing capacity or eliminate certain types of collateral and could otherwise modify or even terminate their loan programs. Any change or termination could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and profitability.\nThe Company's business may be adversely affected by fraud.\nAs a financial institution, the Company is inherently exposed to a wide range of operational risks, including, but not limited to, theft and other fraudulent activity by employees, customers, and other third parties targeting the Company and/or the Company\u2019s customers or data. Such activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts.\nAlthough the Company devotes substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents, given the persistence and increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators, the Company may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud.\nA failure in or breach of the Company\u2019s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of the Company\u2019s third-party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt the Company\u2019s businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage the Company\u2019s reputation, increase the Company\u2019s costs, and cause losses.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information. Although the Company takes numerous protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company\u2019s and its customers\u2019 information across all geographies and product lines, and endeavors to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, the Company\u2019s computer systems, software, and networks and those of the Company\u2019s customers and third-party vendors may be vulnerable to unauthorized payments and account access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks, and other events that could have an adverse security impact and result in significant losses to the Company and/or its customers. These threats may originate externally from increasingly sophisticated third parties, including foreign governments, organized criminal groups, and other hackers, or from outsourced or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or the threats may originate from within the Company\u2019s organization.\nThe Company also faces the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination, or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate the Company\u2019s business activities, including vendors, exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses, or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source or cause of an attack on, or breach of, the Company\u2019s operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, the Company may be at risk of an operational failure with respect to its customers\u2019 systems. The Company\u2019s risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the outsourcing of many of the Company\u2019s business operations, and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nThe Company maintains insurance policies that it believes provide reasonable coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of the Company\u2019s size and scope with similar technological systems. However, the Company cannot assure that these policies will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, or penalties, including lost revenues, should the Company experience any one or more of its or a third party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing an attack.\nThe Company relies on third parties to provide key components of its business infrastructure.\nThe Company relies on third parties to provide key components for its business operations, such as data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access. While the Company selects these third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, or poor performance by a vendor, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt the Company\u2019s operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third-party vendors also could create significant delays and expense. Any of these things could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial performance.\nA change in the Company\u2019s creditworthiness could increase the Company\u2019s cost of funding or adversely affect its liquidity.\nMarket participants regularly evaluate the Company\u2019s creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the Company\u2019s long-term debt based on a number of factors, some of which are not entirely within the Company\u2019s control, including the Company\u2019s financial strength and conditions within the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that the Company's perceived creditworthiness will remain the same. Changes could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the Company is able to obtain funding and its access to the capital markets, and could increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital. Likewise, any loss of or\ndecline in the credit rating assigned to WAB could impair its ability to attract deposits or to obtain other funding sources, or increase its cost of funding.\nThe Company's controls and processes, its reporting systems and procedures, and its operational infrastructure may not be able to keep pace with its growth, which could cause it to experience compliance and operational problems or lose customers, or incur additional expenditures beyond current projections, any one of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s future success will depend on the ability of officers and other key employees to effectively implement solutions designed to improve operational, credit, financial, management and other internal risk controls and processes, as well as improve reporting systems and procedures, while at the same time maintaining and growing existing businesses and client relationships. The Company may not successfully implement such changes or improvements in an efficient or timely manner, or it may discover deficiencies in its existing systems and controls that adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to support and grow its existing businesses and client relationships, and could require the Company to incur additional expenditures to expand its administrative and operational infrastructure. If the Company is unable to maintain and implement improvements to its controls, processes, and reporting systems and procedures, the Company may lose customers, experience compliance and operational problems or incur additional expenditures beyond current projections, any one of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s expansion strategy may not prove to be successful and its market value and profitability may suffer.\nThe Company continually evaluates expansion through acquisitions of banks and other financial assets and businesses. Like previous acquisitions by the Company, any future acquisitions will be accompanied by risks commonly encountered in such transactions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ntime and expense incurred while identifying, evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions and transactions;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in accurately estimating the value of target companies or assets and in evaluating target companies' or assets\u2019 credit, operations, management, and market risks;\n\u2022\npotential payment of a premium over book and market values that may cause dilution of the Company\u2019s tangible book value or earnings per share;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u2022\npotential exposure to asset quality issues of the target company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty of integrating the operations and personnel;\n\u2022\npotential disruption of the Company\u2019s ongoing business;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key personnel at the acquired business;\n\u2022\ninability of the Company\u2019s management to maximize its financial and strategic position by the successful implementation of uniform product offerings and the incorporation of uniform technology into the Company\u2019s product offerings and control systems; and\n\u2022\nfailure to realize any expected revenue increases, cost savings, and other projected benefits from an acquisition.\nThe Company expects that competition for suitable acquisition candidates may be significant. The Company may compete with other banks or financial service companies with similar acquisition strategies, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources. The Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions, or that it will be able to obtain the regulatory approvals needed to complete any such transactions.\nThe Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. Potential regulatory enforcement actions could also adversely affect the Company's ability to engage in certain acquisition activities. The Company\u2019s inability to overcome the risks inherent in the successful completion and integration of acquisitions could have an adverse effect on the achievement of the Company's business strategy.\nThere are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with the introduction or expansion of lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement new lines of business, offer new products and services within existing lines of business, or offer existing products or services to new industries or market segments. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or industries are heavily regulated. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove attainable. External factors, such as compliance with laws and regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences or government policies, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business, product or service or the offering of existing products and services to an emerging industry. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends on its ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors. The Company\u2019s competitors, including large commercial banks, community banks, thrift institutions, mutual savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies, securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, money market mutual funds, and other financial institutions, compete with lending and deposit-gathering services offered by the Company. Increased competition in the Company\u2019s markets may result in reduced loans and deposits or less favorable pricing.\nThere is competition for financial services in the markets in which the Company conduct its businesses, including from many local commercial banks, as well as numerous national and regionally based commercial banks. In particular, the Company has experienced intense price and terms competition in some of the lending lines of business and deposits in recent years. Many of these competing institutions have much greater financial and marketing resources than the Company has. Due to their size, larger competitors can achieve economies of scale and may offer a broader range of products and services or more attractive pricing than the Company. In addition, some of the financial services organizations with which the Company competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured depository institutions. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over the Company in accessing funding and in providing various services.\nThe banking business in the Company\u2019s primary market areas is very competitive, and the level of competition facing the Company may increase further, which may limit its asset growth and financial results. In particular, the Company's predominate source of revenue is net interest income from its loan portfolio. Therefore, if the Company is unable to compete effectively, including sustaining loan and deposit growth at its historical levels, its business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry also is facing increasing competitive pressure from the introduction of disruptive new technologies, often by non-traditional competitors and financial technology companies. Among other things, technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction. The elimination of banks as intermediaries for certain transactions, as well as further disruption of traditional bank businesses and products by non-banks, could result in the loss of fee income and deposits and otherwise adversely affect our business and results.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent upon its ability to recruit and retain qualified employees, including members of its divisional and business line leadership and management teams.\nThe Company\u2019s business plan includes and is dependent upon hiring and retaining highly qualified and motivated executives and employees at every level. In particular, the Company\u2019s relative success to date has been partly the result of its management\u2019s ability to identify and retain highly qualified employees in administrative support roles, as well as those with expertise in certain specialty areas or that have long-standing relationships in their communities or markets. These professionals bring with them valuable knowledge, specialized skills and expertise, and customer relationships and have been an integral part of the Company\u2019s ability to attract deposits and to expand its market share.\nAdditionally, as part of the Company's strategy, the Company depends on divisional and business line leadership and management teams in each of its significant geographic locations. In addition to their skills and experience as bankers, these persons provide the Company with extensive ties within markets upon which the Company\u2019s competitive strategy is based.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to retain these highly qualified and motivated persons may be hindered by the fact that it has not entered into employment agreements with most of them. The Company incentivizes employee retention through its equity incentive plans; however, the Company cannot guarantee the effectiveness of its equity incentive plans in retaining these key employees and executives. Were the Company to lose key employees, it may not be able to replace them with equally qualified persons who bring the same knowledge of and ties to the communities and markets within which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to hire or retain qualified employees, it may not be able to successfully execute its business strategy or may incur additional costs to achieve its objectives.\nThe Company could be harmed if its succession planning is inadequate to mitigate the loss of key members of its senior management team.\nThe Company believes that its senior management team, including, but not limited to, Robert Sarver, its Executive Chairman and Kenneth Vecchione, its CEO, have contributed greatly to its performance. In addition, the Company from time to time experiences retirements and other changes to its senior management team. The Company's future performance depends on a smooth transition of its senior management, including finding and training highly qualified replacements who are properly equipped to lead the Company. The Company has adopted retention strategies, including equity awards, from which its senior management team benefits in order to achieve its goals, and entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Vecchione, which expires in 2020. However, the Company cannot assure its succession planning and retention strategies will be effective and the loss of senior management could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company's risk management practices may prove to be inadequate or not fully effective.\nThe Company's risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. The Company has established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor, and manage the types of risk to which it is subject, including, but not limited to, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk. A BOD level risk committee approves and reviews the Company's key risk management policies and oversees operation of the Company's risk management framework. Although the Company has devoted significant resources to developing its risk management policies and procedures and expects to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as the Company's risk management techniques, may not be fully effective. In addition, as regulations and the markets in which the Company operates continue to evolve, the Company's risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If the Company's risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate its risks, the Company could suffer unexpected losses or other material adverse impact. Management of the Company's risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models the Company uses to mitigate these risks are inadequate, or are subject to ineffective governance, the Company may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that the Company has not appropriately anticipated, identified, or mitigated.\nThe Company's internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and the accuracy of the Company's judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters may impact operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company's management regularly reviews and updates its internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company's controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could result in materially inaccurate reported financial statements and/or have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Similarly, the Company's management makes certain estimates and judgments in preparing the Company's financial statements. The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will impact the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nIf the Company is unable to understand and adapt to technological change, the Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology can increase efficiency and enable financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. However, some new technologies needed to compete effectively result in incremental operating costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors, because of their larger size and available capital, have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets in which the Company operates are subject to the risk of both natural and man-made disasters.\nMany of the real and personal properties securing the Company's loans are located in California. Much of California experiences wildfires from time to time that cause significant damage throughout the state. While these wildfires did not significantly damage the Company's own properties, it is possible that its borrowers may experience losses as a result, which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their obligations. California is also prone to other natural disasters, including, but not limited to, drought, earthquakes, flooding, and mudslides. Additional significant natural or man-made disasters in the state of California or in the Company's other markets could lead to damage or injury to the Company's own properties and/or employees, and could increase the risk that many of its borrowers may experience losses or sustained job interruption, which may materially impair their ability to maintain deposits or meet the terms of their loan obligations. Therefore, additional natural disasters, a man-made disaster or a catastrophic event, or a combination of these or other factors, in any of the Company's markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Banking Industry\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern the Company\u2019s operations, corporate governance, executive compensation, and accounting principles, or changes in them, or the Company\u2019s failure to comply with them, may adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations. Intended to protect customers, depositors, and the DIF, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which the Company can engage, require monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity and of customers who are perceived to present a heightened risk of money laundering or other illegal activity, limit the dividends or distributions that WAB can pay to the Company or that the Company can pay to its stockholders, restrict the ability of affiliates to guarantee the Company\u2019s debt, impose certain specific accounting requirements on the Company that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in the Company\u2019s capital than does GAAP, among other things. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose significant additional compliance costs. To the extent the Company continues to grow larger and become more complex, regulatory oversight and risk and the cost of compliance will likely increase, which may adversely affect the Company. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Supervision and Regulation\u201d included in this Form 10-K for a more detailed summary of the regulations and supervision to which the Company are subject.\nChanges to the legal and regulatory framework governing the Company\u2019s operations, including the passage and continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and EGRRCPA, have drastically revised the laws and regulations under which the Company operates. In general, bank regulators have increased their focus on risk management and regulatory compliance, and the Company expects this focus to continue. Additional compliance requirements may be costly to implement, may require additional compliance personnel, and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer competitive products to its customers.\nThe Company is also subject to changes in federal and state law, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws, and accounting principles. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous review and frequently change, and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Regulations and laws may be modified at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect the Company, WAB, and the Company\u2019s other subsidiaries. Any changes in federal and state law, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws, and accounting principles, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, including ways that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations. Failure to appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles or an alleged failure to comply, even if the Company acted in good faith or the alleged failure reflects a difference in interpretation, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nState and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of the Company\u2019s business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and the Company\u2019s failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which the Company is or becomes subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect the Company.\nState and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of the Company\u2019s business, including for compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, an agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of the Company\u2019s operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, federal banking agencies may take a number of different remedial or enforcement actions it deems appropriate to remedy such a deficiency. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in the Company\u2019s capital, to restrict the Company\u2019s growth, and to assess civil monetary penalties against the Company and/or officers or directors, and to remove officers and directors. If the FDIC concludes that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, it may terminate WAB\u2019s deposit insurance. Under Arizona law, the state banking supervisory authority has many of the same enforcement powers with respect to its state-chartered banks. Finally, the CFPB has the authority to examine the Company and has authority to take enforcement actions, including the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or civil monetary penalties against the Company if it finds that the Company offers consumer financial products and services in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws or in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive manner.\nIf the Company were unable to comply with regulatory directives in the future, or if the Company were unable to comply with the terms of any future supervisory requirements to which the Company may become subject, then it could become subject to a variety of supervisory actions and orders, including cease and desist orders, prompt corrective actions, MOUs, and/or other regulatory enforcement actions. If the Company\u2019s regulators were to take such supervisory actions, then the Company could, among other things, become subject to restrictions on its ability to enter into acquisitions and develop any new business, as well as restrictions on its existing business. The Company also could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. Failure to implement the measures in the time frames provided, or at all, could result in additional orders or penalties from federal and state regulators, which could result in one or more of the remedial actions described above. In the event the Company was ultimately unable to comply with the terms of a regulatory enforcement action, it could fail and be placed into receivership by the FDIC or the chartering agency. The terms of any such supervisory action and the consequences associated with any failure to comply therewith could have a material negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating flexibility, and financial condition.\nUncertainty about the future of LIBOR, and its accepted alternatives, may adversely affect our business.\nThe United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the agency that regulates LIBOR, has announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021, which may result in the use of LIBOR in financial contracts being phased out by the end of 2021. The ARRC has proposed that the SOFR represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. It is not possible at this time to predict what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as the SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our loan and lease and investment portfolios, asset-liability management, business, financial condition and results of operations. LIBOR is the reference rate for many transactions in which the Company lends and borrows money, issues, purchases and sells securities and enters into derivative contracts to manage its or its customers\u2019 risk related to these transactions. Accordingly, management has established a LIBOR transition team to lead the Company in the execution of its project plan. Despite these efforts, the manner and impact of this transition and related developments, as well as the effect of these developments on the Company's funding costs, investment and trading securities portfolios, and business, is uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's profitability.\nChanges in interest rates and increased rate competition could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability, business, and prospects.\nMost of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, which subjects the Company to significant risks from changes in interest rates and can impact the Company\u2019s net income and the valuation of its assets and liabilities. Increases or decreases in prevailing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, asset quality, and prospects. The Company derives substantially all of its revenue from net interest income and, therefore, its operating income and net income depend to a great extent on its net interest margin. Net interest margin is the difference between the interest yields the Company receives on loans, securities, and other earning assets and the interest rates the Company pays on interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and other liabilities. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including competition, general economic conditions, and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the FRB. In a rising rate environment, the rate of interest the Company pays on its interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and other liabilities may increase more quickly than the rate of interest the Company receives on loans, securities, and other earning assets, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s net interest income and earnings. The Company\u2019s earnings also could be adversely affected in a declining rate environment if the rates on the Company\u2019s loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on its deposits and other liabilities. Because of the Company's relatively high reliance on net interest income, its revenue and earnings are more sensitive to changes in market rates than other financial institutions that have more diversified sources of revenue. The Company experiences substantial competition on the basis of interest rates for both loans and deposits.\nIn addition, loan volumes are affected by market interest rates on loans. Lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations, while rising interest rates are generally associated with a lower volume of loan originations. Conversely, in falling interest rate environments, loan repayment rates will increase and, in rising interest rate environments, loan repayment rates will decline. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to minimize interest rate risk. In addition, an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations.\nInterest rates also affect how much money the Company can lend. When interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases. Accordingly, changes in market interest rates could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s net interest income, asset quality, loan origination volume, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which the Company obtains title.\nApproximately 55% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 was secured by real estate. In the course of the Company\u2019s business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. The Company may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation, and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if the Company is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, the Company may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could be substantial and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and prospects.\nRisks Related to the Company's Common Stock\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange constantly changes. The Company expects that the market price of its common stock will continue to fluctuate and there can be no assurances about the market price for its common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the political climate or public policy, including international trade policy;\n\u2022\nsales of the Company\u2019s equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s financial condition, performance, creditworthiness, and prospects;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in the Company\u2019s operating results or the quality of its assets;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts, and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to the Company\u2019s future financial performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions, and other material events by the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nthe operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to the Company;\n\u2022\nthe credit, mortgage, and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve;\n\u2022\nchanges in national and global financial markets and economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility and other geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events; and\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s past and future dividend and share repurchase practices.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of the Company\u2019s equity, which may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company is not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The Company also grants a significant number of shares of common stock to employees and directors under the Company\u2019s Incentive Plan each year. The issuance of any additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or preferred stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common stock, or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to stockholders of the Company\u2019s common stock. Holders of the Company\u2019s common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle such holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series. Because the Company\u2019s decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions, its acquisition activity, and other factors, the Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of its future offerings. Thus, the Company\u2019s stockholders bear the risk of the Company\u2019s future offerings reducing the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock and diluting their stock holdings in the Company.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.\nOn June 4, 2019, the Company announced that its BOD authorized the initiation of regular quarterly dividends pursuant to which the Company intends to pay dividends on its common stock, subject to quarterly declarations by the BOD. During 2019, the Company declared and paid two quarterly cash dividends of $0.25 per common share. In December 2018, the Company adopted a common stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $250.0 million of its outstanding common stock through December 2019. During 2019, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 2,822,402 shares of common stock. The common stock repurchase program was renewed through December 2020, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to an additional $250.0 million of its outstanding common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time-to-time, and no assurance can be provided that it will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. Dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and the discretion of the Company\u2019s BOD, which must evaluate, among other things, whether cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of its stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and any agreements containing provisions that limit the Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay cash dividends and/or repurchase stock. In addition, the amount the Company spends and the number of shares that it is able to repurchase under its stock repurchase program may be further affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which the Company is restricted from repurchasing shares. A reduction in or elimination of the Company\u2019s dividend payments, dividend program and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s stock price.\nOfferings of debt, which would be senior to the Company\u2019s common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities that may be senior to the Company\u2019s common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may from time to time issue debt securities, borrow money through other means, or issue preferred stock. From time to time the Company borrows money from the FRB, the FHLB, other financial institutions, and other lenders. At December 31, 2019, the Company had outstanding $175,000,000 of 6.25% subordinated debentures with a maturity date of July 1, 2056, and WAB had outstanding $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2025. All of these securities or borrowings have priority over the common stock in a liquidation, which could affect the market price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe Company\u2019s BOD is authorized to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of the stockholders. The Company\u2019s BOD also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over the Company\u2019s common stock with respect to dividends or upon the Company\u2019s dissolution, winding-up, and liquidation and other terms. If the Company issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over its common stock, with respect to the payment of dividends or upon the Company\u2019s liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, or if the Company issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock and/or the rights of holders of its common stock, the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law and provisions of the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and its Amended and Restated Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of the Company. Additionally, the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes the Company\u2019s BOD to issue additional series of preferred stock and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders.", "PERMNO": 90776, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WAL"}
