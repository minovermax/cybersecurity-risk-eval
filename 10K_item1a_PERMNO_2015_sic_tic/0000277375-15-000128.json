Risk Factors\nThe risk factors below should be carefully considered.\nWEATHER CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE OUR REVENUES TO VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR.\nOur revenues vary from year to year, depending on weather conditions. We estimate that approximately 74% of our annual natural gas sales are temperature sensitive. As a result, mild winter temperatures can cause a decrease in the amount of natural gas we sell in any year, which would reduce our revenues and profits. Our weather normalization tariff, approved by the Kentucky Public Service Commission, only partially mitigates this risk. Under our weather normalization provision in our tariff, we adjust our rates for our residential and small non-residential customers to reflect variations from thirty year average weather for our December through April billing cycles.\nOUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMERS' NATURAL GAS REQUIREMENTS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF CONTRACTED NATURAL GAS SUPPLIES AND INTERSTATE PIPELINE SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, ARE NOT DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF FEDERAL REGULATIONS DECREASE OUR AVAILABLE CAPACITY.\nWe are responsible for acquiring sufficient natural gas supplies, interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity to meet\ncurrent and future customers' annual and seasonal natural gas requirements. We purchase almost all of our natural gas supply from interstate sources and rely on interstate pipelines to transport natural gas to our system. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates the transportation of the natural gas we receive from interstate sources, and it could increase our transportation costs or decrease our available pipeline capacity by changing its regulatory policies. Additionally, federal legislation could restrict or limit drilling which could decrease the supply of available natural gas. A decrease in interstate pipeline capacity available to us or an increase in competition for interstate pipeline transportation service could reduce our normal interstate supply of natural gas. If we are not able to maintain a reliable and adequate natural gas supply and sufficient pipeline capacity to deliver that supply, we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements resulting in a loss of customers and decrease in profits.\nOUR CUSTOMERS ARE ABLE TO BY-PASS OUR DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS.\nOur larger customers can obtain their natural gas supply by purchasing directly from interstate suppliers, local producers or marketers. Customers for whom we transport natural gas could by-pass our transportation system to directly connect to interstate pipelines or other transportation providers. Customers may undertake such by-passes in order to achieve lower prices for their natural gas and/or transportation services. Our larger customers who are in close proximity to alternative supply would be most likely to consider taking this action. This potential to by-pass our distribution and transportation systems creates a risk of the loss of large customers and thus could result in lower revenues and profits.\nACTIONS BY OUR REGULATORS COULD DECREASE FUTURE PROFITABILITY.\nWe are regulated by the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Our regulated segment generates a significant portion of our operating revenues. We face the risk that the Kentucky Public Service Commission may fail to grant us adequate and timely rate increases, may decrease our rates or may take other actions that would cause a reduction in our income from operations, such as limiting our ability to pass on to our customers our costs of natural gas. Such regulatory actions would decrease our revenues and our profitability. Additionally, our consolidated financial statements reflect the application of regulatory accounting standards by our regulated segment. Our regulated segment has recognized regulatory assets representing costs incurred in prior periods that are probable of recovery from customers in future rates. Disallowance of such costs in future proceedings before the Kentucky Public Service Commission could require us to write-off regulatory assets, which could have a material impact on our income and consolidated financial statements.\nVOLATILITY IN PRICES COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITS.\nSignificant increases or lack of stability in the price of natural gas will likely cause our regulated retail customers to increase conservation or switch to alternate sources of energy. Any decrease in the volume of natural gas we sell that is caused by such actions will reduce our revenues and profits. Higher prices also make it more difficult to add new customers. Significant decreases in the price of natural gas will likely cause our non-regulated segment's gross margins to decrease. The price of natural gas liquids is determined by a national unregulated market, and decreases in the price could result in a decrease in our non-regulated gross margins.\nDERIVATIVES LEGISLATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.\nAs part of our risk management strategy, we currently use, and historically have used, forward commodity contracts, which meet the criteria of a derivative. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) adopted a comprehensive framework for the regulation of over-the-counter swaps (\u201cOTC swaps\u201d). The Dodd-Frank Act divides regulatory authority over swap agreements between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and requires that most OTC swaps be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility. While the SEC and CFTC have adopted numerous regulations relating to OTC swaps, they are still in the process of rulemaking to address all of the requirements regarding OTC swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act. Current and future legal and regulatory requirements, restrictions and regulations imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and could affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available counterparties. Our inability to enter into derivative contracts at favorable terms, or at all, could increase our operating expenses and our ability to hedge our business risks.\nINTERSTATE AND OTHER PIPELINES DELTA INTERCONNECTS WITH CAN IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR PIPELINE.\nThe pipelines interconnected to Delta's system are owned and operated by third parties who can impose restrictions on the quantity and quality of natural gas they will accept into their pipelines. To the extent natural gas on Delta's system does not conform to these restrictions, Delta could experience a decrease in volumes sold or transported to these pipelines.\nFUTURE PROFITABILITY OF THE NON-REGULATED SEGMENT IS DEPENDENT ON A FEW INDUSTRIAL AND OTHER LARGE-VOLUME CUSTOMERS.\nOur non-regulated customers are primarily industrial and other large-volume customers. Fluctuations in the natural gas requirements of these customers can have a significant impact on the profitability of the non-regulated segment.\nA DECLINE IN THE LIQUIDS PRESENT IN OUR NATURAL GAS SUPPLY, OR LIQUIDS SALES PRICES, COULD REDUCE OUR NON-REGULATED REVENUES.\nTo improve the operations of our distribution, transmission and storage system, we operate a facility that is designed to extract liquids from the natural gas in our system. We are able to sell these liquids at a price determined by a national unregulated market. A reduction in the quantity of liquids present in our natural gas supply, or reductions in the prices we receive for such liquids sales, could result in a reduction of the earnings of our non-regulated segment.\nWE RELY ON ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY.\nTo the extent that internally generated cash coupled with short-term borrowings under our bank line of credit is not sufficient for our operating cash requirements and normal capital expenditures, we may need to obtain additional financing. Additionally, market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our access to capital markets. Such disruptions could include: economic downturns, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company, general capital market conditions, market prices for natural gas, terrorist attacks or the overall financial health of the energy industry. There is no guarantee we could obtain needed capital in the future.\nPOOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN HOLDINGS AND OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING PENSION COSTS COULD UNFAVORABLY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur cost of providing a non-contributory defined benefit retirement plan is dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding level of the plan, future government regulation and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plan. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plan assets and depending upon the other factors impacting our costs as listed above, we could be required to fund our plan with additional significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISKS OF CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS.\nAdverse economic conditions affecting, or financial difficulties of, customers and others with whom we do business could impair the ability of these customers and others to pay for our services or fulfill their contractual obligations or cause them to delay such payments or obligations. We depend on these customers and others to remit payments on a timely basis. Any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSUBSTANTIAL OPERATIONAL RISKS ARE INVOLVED IN OPERATING A NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION, TRANSPORTATION, LIQUIDS EXTRACTION AND STORAGE SYSTEM AND SUCH OPERATIONAL EVENTS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND INCREASE EXPENSES.\nThere are substantial risks associated with the operation of a natural gas distribution, transportation, liquids extraction and storage system, such as operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions caused by events beyond our control. These include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of pipeline and storage facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency, loss of gas from storage facilities, measurement issues and catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, earthquakes, floods, landslides or other similar events beyond our control. These risks could result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental pollution, which in turn could lead to substantial financial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Liabilities incurred that are not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, interruptions to the operation of our natural gas distribution, transmission, liquids extraction or storage system caused by such events could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses.\nWE MAY FACE CERTAIN REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL RISKS RELATED TO PIPELINE SAFETY LEGISLATION.\nIncreased regulatory oversight over pipeline operations and increased investment to inspect pipeline facilities, upgrade pipeline facilities, or control the impact of a breach of such facilities at the federal level could require additional operating expenses and capital expenditures to remain in compliance with any increased federal oversight. While we cannot predict with certainty the extent of these expenses and expenditures or when they might become effective, this could result in significant additional compliance costs to us and we may be unable to recover from our customers, through the regulatory process, all or some of these costs and an authorized rate of return on these costs.\nHURRICANES, EXTREME WEATHER, WELL-HEAD OR PIPELINE DISASTERS COULD DISRUPT OUR NATURAL GAS SUPPLY AND INCREASE NATURAL GAS PRICES.\nHurricanes, extreme weather, well-head or pipeline disasters could damage production or transportation facilities, which could result in decreased supplies of natural gas, increased supply costs for us and higher prices for our customers.\nOUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE VARIOUS FINANCIAL AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS AND A PREPAYMENT PENALTY THAT COULD RESTRICT OUR ACTIVITIES.\nOur bank line of credit and Series A Notes contain financial covenants. A default on the performance of any single obligation incurred in connection with our borrowings, or a default on other indebtedness that exceeds $2,500,000, simultaneously creates an event of default with the bank line of credit and the Series A Notes. If we breach any of the financial covenants under these agreements, our debt repayment obligations under the bank line of credit and Series A Notes could be accelerated. For example, if we default we may not be able to refinance, repay all our indebtedness, pay dividends or have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements, all of which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOUR LONG-TERM DEBT ARRANGEMENTS LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS WE MAY PAY AND OUR ABILITY TO REPURCHASE OUR STOCK.\nUnder the terms of our 4.26% Series A Notes, the aggregate amount we may pay in dividends on our common stock and to repurchase our common stock is limited based on our cumulative net income and dividends paid. Consequently, as of June 30, 2015 our Series A Notes permit us to pay up to an additional $23,634,000 in dividends and for the repurchase of our common stock. However, if we fail to generate sufficient net income in the future, our ability to continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend may be impaired and the value of our common stock would likely decline.\nA SECURITY BREACH COULD DISRUPT OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INTERRUPT THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE WE PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, COMPROMISE THE SAFETY OF OUR NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION, TRANSMISSION, LIQUIDS EXTRACTION AND STORAGE SYSTEMS OR EXPOSE CONFIDENTIAL PERSONAL INFORMATION.\nSecurity breaches of our information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks and cyber-terrorism, could lead to information system disruptions or shutdowns, result in the interruption of our ability to provide natural gas to our customers or compromise the safety of our distribution, transmission, liquids extraction and storage systems. If such an attack or security breach were to occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, such an attack could affect our ability to service our indebtedness, our ability to raise capital and our future growth opportunities.\nAdditionally, a breakdown or a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer, employee, vendor, investor or other sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition. We could also be exposed to claims by persons harmed by such a breakdown or breach. Such a breakdown or breach could also materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such risks. There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches.\nFAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN AN APPROPRIATELY QUALIFIED WORKFORCE COULD UNFAVORABLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nCertain situations, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill sets to complement future needs, or unavailability of a qualified workforce, may lead to increased operational risks and costs. As a result, we may be unable to hire an adequate number of individuals who are knowledgeable about public utilities and the natural gas industry and/or face a lengthy time period associated with skill development and knowledge transfer. Failure to address this risk may result in increased operational and safety risks as well as increased costs. Even if we have reasonable plans in place to address succession planning and workforce training, we cannot control the future availability of qualified labor. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our financial position or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nNEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.\nChanges in laws and regulations, including new accounting standards and tax laws, could change the way in which we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Additionally, governing bodies may choose to re-interpret laws and regulations. These changes could have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or access to capital.\nWE MAY FACE CERTAIN REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL RISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION.\nFuture proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions, measured in carbon dioxide equivalent units, could adversely affect our operating and service costs and demand for our product. In the past, the United States Congress has considered legislative proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has adopted regulations to limit carbon emissions. Future legislation and the implementation of existing regulations could increase utility costs and prices charged to utility customers. Unless we are able to timely recover the costs of such impacts from customers through the regulatory process, costs associated with any such regulatory or legislative changes could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 29285, "SIC": 4923, "TIC": "DGAS"}
