{"cik": "1579684", "company": "Gannett Co., Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our Common Stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, our ability to make distributions on our Common Stock, and the market price of our Common Stock. For ease of review, the risk factors have been grouped into categories, but many of the risks described in a given category relate to multiple categories.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition and Integration of Legacy Gannett\nWe may not achieve the intended benefits of the acquisition of Legacy Gannett.\nWe completed the acquisition of Legacy Gannett in November 2019, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the expected benefits of the transaction.\nThere are many challenges associated with integrating a material acquisition, such as our acquisition of Legacy Gannett, including the integration of executive and other employee teams with historically different cultures and priorities; the coordination of personnel located across multiple geographic locations; retaining key management and other employees; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; as well as unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition. These and other challenges could result in unanticipated operational challenges and the failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected timeframe or at all.\nIf we fail to realize anticipated synergies in the amount and within the timeframe expected, our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from the illustrative financial information disclosed in connection with the acquisition, which was based on various assumptions and estimates that may prove to be incorrect. Such illustrative financial information did not constitute management\u2019s projections of future financial performance or results of operations; however, any material variance from such illustrative financial information could result in negative investor reactions that materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially even if synergies are realized, due to macroeconomic factors or a variety of other risks to our business that are independent of the acquisition.\nOur future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations.\nWith completion of the Legacy Gannett acquisition, the size of our business has increased significantly. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which poses substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We cannot assure you that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, and other benefits from the combination that we currently anticipate.\nThe diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention to the integration of Legacy Gannett could adversely affect our day-to-day business.\nThe integration of Legacy Gannett places a significant burden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with the Legacy Gannett acquisition, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn November 2019, pursuant to the acquisition of Legacy Gannett, the Company entered into a five-year, senior-secured term loan facility with Apollo Capital Management, L.P. (\"Apollo\") in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.8 billion. The term loan facility matures on November 19, 2024 and generally bears interest at the rate of 11.5% per annum. Accordingly, we are required to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to fund interest payments. In\naddition, we are required to repay our credit facility from time to time with (i) the proceeds of non-ordinary course asset sales and casualty and condemnation events, (ii) a percentage of excess cash flow (ranging from 50% to 90%, depending on the current leverage ratio), and (iii) any unrestricted cash at the end of the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years in excess of $40 million. Our debt service obligations reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, investments and potential distributions to stockholders. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations. Our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operations, which is subject to a variety of risks, including general economic conditions and the strength of our competitors, which are outside our control.\nWe have stated our intention to refinance our indebtedness prior to maturity on more favorable terms, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Our ability to achieve more favorable terms would likely require us to substantially reduce our total outstanding indebtedness relative to current levels. Our ability to prepay our existing indebtedness is highly dependent on both the strength of our cash flow from operations as well as our ability to generate significant proceeds from sales of real estate, the timing and amount of which is highly uncertain. In addition, any refinancing would depend upon the condition of the finance and credit markets.\nThe terms of our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. Our credit facility requires us to comply with numerous affirmative and negative covenants, including a requirement to maintain minimum liquidity of $20 million, and restrictions limiting our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make investments and acquisitions, pay certain dividends, sell assets, merge, incur certain liens, enter into agreements with its affiliates, make capital expenditures, change our business, engage in sale/leaseback transactions, and modify our organizational documents. With respect to dividends, we are prohibited from paying cash dividends until after the thirtieth day of the second full fiscal quarter after the closing of the acquisition (i.e., April 30), and after such date, we can only pay cash dividends up to an agreed-upon amount, provided the ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the credit facility) does not exceed a specified ratio. For these and other reasons generally affecting the ability to pay dividends, our stockholders will not receive dividends in an amount equal to the amount paid prior to the acquisition. Stockholders also should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared.\nA failure to satisfy our debt service obligations, a breach of a covenant in our credit facility, or a material breach of a representation or warranty in our credit facility, among other events specified in the credit facility, could give rise to a default, which could give rise to the right of our lenders to declare our indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. An acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nOne of our lenders, Apollo, has the right to appoint representatives to our Board, and Apollo\u2019s interests may conflict with those of our stockholders.\nOur credit facility grants Apollo the right to appoint two board observers to our Board. In the event that the ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the term loan facility) drops below certain specified thresholds, Apollo will have the right to appoint up to two voting directors (who must be reasonably acceptable to us) in lieu of such board observer(s). The interests of Apollo, as a lender under our credit facility, may conflict with those of our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Competition from Digital Media\nOur business currently relies on sources of revenue that have been, and likely will continue to be, negatively affected by digital commerce and media.\nIn recent years, we have experienced declining revenue (on a same-store basis). The majority of our revenue is from (i) advertising and marketing services and (ii) paid circulation (in each case, both in print and digital mediums). Print advertising alone accounted for approximately 37% of our total revenue as of December 31, 2019.\nTo date, our revenue declines have been driven primarily by a pronounced decline across all categories of print advertising revenue (national, local and classified) related to the rise of digital media and commerce. Media companies generally charge much lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising due to the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space, and mobile advertising rates typically are even lower than desktop digital rates. Additionally, brick-and-mortar businesses are significant consumers of print advertising and with the rise of digital commerce many of these types of businesses have, and continue to, close retail outlets, which adversely affects the demand for print advertising.\nCirculation revenue has been affected to a lesser extent, but more marked future declines in circulation revenue are possible. Revenue from paid circulation is a function of the volume of subscribers and the price of subscriptions. In recent years, we have experienced significant declines in the number of subscribers to our newspapers, as a result of competition from digital media and the demographic shift of traditional print newspaper readers getting older while younger generations tend to consume media through digital platforms. We have also focused on growing the volume of digital subscribers, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow, or even retain, our current digital subscriber volume, especially at rates similar to the rates we are able to charge for our print products.\nDeclining subscriber volume can also lead to more marked declines in advertising revenue. Print subscriber volume declines directly impact preprint and other print revenues that are linked to number of subscribers. In terms of digital advertising revenues, news aggregation websites and customized news feeds (often free to users) reduce traffic on our websites and related digital advertising revenues. These types of websites also compete with us in selling digital only subscriptions to our websites which reduces our ability to monetize our content digitally. If traffic levels stagnate or decline, and/or print subscriber volume continues to decline, we may not be able to maintain or increase the advertising rates or attract new advertising customers.\nWe also generate revenue from a commercial printing and distribution business that manage printing and distribution of publications for third parties, which generated approximately 7% of our revenue in 2019. Our commercial and / or printing businesses could also be adversely affected by the same secular trends that are affecting our core advertising and circulation revenues. These third parties are experiencing the same print volume declines our business experiences and as such our commercial printing and distribution revenues could experience declines in the future. In addition, our relationships with these third parties are generally pursuant to short-term contracts, and a decision by any of the three largest national publications or the major local publications to cease publishing in those markets or seek alternatives to their current business practice of partnering with us could have an additional adverse effect on our revenue trends.\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, we may experience persistent declines in revenue, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, our ability to make distributions on our Common Stock and the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to stabilize revenue trends.\nWe have focused on offsetting traditional print advertising and circulation revenue declines in part by diversifying our sources of revenue through the development and acquisition of complementary businesses with growth potential. For example, our business UpCurve offers a suite of technology solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and GateHouse Live produces local events. With the acquisition of Legacy Gannett, we expanded our digital marketing solutions businesses to include ReachLocal and WordStream.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to grow revenue from these or other complementary businesses we may develop internally or acquire, or that any revenue generated by new business lines will be adequate to offset revenue declines from our legacy businesses. For example, technological developments could adversely affect the availability, applicability, marketability and profitability of the suite of SMB services we offer. Technological developments and any changes we make to our business strategy may require significant capital investments, and such investments may be restricted by our current credit facility.\nThese complementary businesses also face competition from various digital media providers such as Google and Yahoo!, who may have more resources to invest in product development and marketing. Our salesforce may not be able to utilize the relationships we have throughout our local property network to effectively sell these products. If we are unable to diversify our traditional revenues with revenues from complementary businesses, we may experience persistent declines in revenue which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, our ability to make distributions on our common stock and the market price of our common stock.\nOur ReachLocal business purchases most of its media from Google, and its business could be adversely affected if Google takes actions that are adverse to our interests or if we fail to meet advertiser or spend targets necessary for receiving rebates from Google. WordStream also derives significant revenue from customer spend on Google media. Similar actions from Yahoo!, Microsoft, Facebook and other media providers also could adversely affect these businesses.\nMost of ReachLocal and WordStream's cost of sales relates to the purchase of media, and a substantial majority of the media it purchases is from Google. In addition, a substantial portion of WordStream's revenue consists of rebates from Google for achieving certain advertiser or spend targets. Google accounts for a large majority of all U.S. searches, and Google's share\nin foreign markets is often even greater. As a result, we expect our ReachLocal and WordStream businesses will depend upon media purchases and rebates from Google for the foreseeable future. This dependence makes that business vulnerable to actions Google may take to change the manner in which it sells AdWords, provides rebates to us, or conducts its business. In addition, any new developments or rumors of developments regarding Google's business practices that affect the local online advertising industry may adversely affect our products or create perceptions with clients that our ability to compete in the online marketing industry has been impaired. These risks also apply to other publishers with whom we do business, including Yahoo!, Facebook and Microsoft, though to a lesser degree.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Factors\nOur ability to generate revenue is highly sensitive to the strength of the economies in which we operate and the demographics of the local communities that we serve.\nOur advertising revenues and, to a lesser extent, circulation revenues, depend upon a variety of factors specific to the communities that our publications serve. These factors include, among others, the size and demographic characteristics of the local population, local economic conditions in general and the economic condition of the retail segments of the communities that our publications serve. If the local economy, population or prevailing retail environment of a community we serve experiences a downturn, our publications, revenues and profitability in that market could be adversely affected. Our advertising revenues are also susceptible to negative trends in the general economy that affect consumer spending. The advertisers in our newspapers and other publications and related websites are primarily retail businesses that can be significantly affected by regional or national economic downturns and other developments. For example, many traditional retail companies continue to face greater competition from online retailers and face uncertainty in their businesses, which has reduced and may continue to reduce their advertising spending. Declines in the U.S. economy could also significantly affect key advertising revenue categories, such as help wanted, real estate, and automotive.\nUncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions of markets in which we participate may negatively affect our business.\nCurrent and future conditions in the economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including the markets in which we participate. Adverse changes may occur as a result of weak global economic conditions, declining oil prices, wavering consumer confidence, unemployment, declines in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, declines in real estate values, natural disasters, or other factors affecting economic conditions in general. These changes may negatively affect the sales of our products, increase exposure to losses from bad debts, increase the cost and decrease the availability of financing, or increase costs associated with publishing and distributing our publications.\nThe collectability of accounts receivable under adverse economic conditions could deteriorate to a greater extent than provided for in our financial statements and in our projections of future results.\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. may increase our exposure to losses resulting from financial distress, insolvency and the potential bankruptcy of our advertising customers. We recorded write-offs of accounts receivable relating to recent bankruptcies of national retailers, including Sears and Bon Ton, among others. Our accounts receivable is stated at net estimated realizable value, and our allowance for doubtful accounts has been determined based on several factors, including receivable agings, significant individual credit risk accounts and historical experience. If such collectability estimates prove inaccurate, adjustments to future operating results could occur.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nWe may be unsuccessful in managing our international operations.\nNewsquest operates in the U.K., and ReachLocal has international sales operations in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, as well as campaign support services in India. Revenue from Newsquest accounted for 1.5% of our Publishing segment's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue from international operations outside North America accounted for 1.8% of our Marketing Solutions segment's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our ability to manage these international operations successfully is subject to numerous risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u2022\nChallenges or uncertainties arising from unexpected legal, political, or systemic events;\n\u2022\nDifficulties or delays in developing a network of clients in international markets;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nDifferent legal or regulatory requirements, including with respect to internet services, privacy and data protection, censorship, banking and money transmitting, and selling, which may limit or prevent the offering of our products in some jurisdictions or otherwise harm our business;\n\u2022\nInternational intellectual property laws that may be insufficient to protect our intellectual property or permit us to successfully defend our intellectual property in international lawsuits;\n\u2022\nDifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers' councils and labor unions, which could make it more difficult to terminate underperforming salespeople;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in accounts receivable collection;\n\u2022\nCurrency fluctuations and price controls or other restrictions on foreign currency;\n\u2022\nPotential adverse tax consequences including difficulties in repatriating earnings generated abroad; and\n\u2022\nLack of infrastructure to adequately conduct electronic commerce transactions.\nAny of the foregoing factors could adversely impact our international operations, which could harm our overall business, operating results, and financial condition.\nForeign exchange variability could materially and adversely affect our consolidated operating results.\nOur financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Newsquest operates in the U.K., and its operations are conducted in foreign currency, primarily the British pound sterling. Weakening in the British pound sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rate has in the past, and could in the future, diminish Newsquest's contributions to our results of operations. In addition, ReachLocal conducts operations in several foreign jurisdictions. If the value of currency in any of those jurisdictions weakens as compared with the U.S. dollar, ReachLocal\u2019s operations in those jurisdictions similarly will contribute less to our results.\nThe U.K. vote to leave the European Union could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe U.K. left the European Union on January 31, 2020 (\u201cBrexit\u201d). At this stage, the nature of the future relationship between the U.K. and the remaining European Union countries following Brexit has yet to be agreed, and negotiations with the European Union on the terms of Brexit have demonstrated the difficulties that exist in reaching such an agreement. Depending on the terms of the negotiations, the U.K. could also lose access to the single European Union market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members. Such a decline in trade could affect the attractiveness of the U.K. as a global investment center and, as a result, could have a detrimental impact on economic growth in the country. Furthermore, regardless of the form of any withdrawal agreement, there are likely to be changes in the legal rights and obligations of commercial parties across all industries following Brexit, and British regulatory requirements once outside the European Union could be subject to significant change. Any of the foregoing could result in an economic downturn in Newsquest\u2019s markets, which could depress the demand for our products and services.\nThe potential enactment of a Digital Services Tax in the U.K. may impact future results.\nOn July 11, 2019, Her Majesty's Treasury and Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC) issued draft legislation describing the framework of a proposed Digital Services Tax (DST) in the United Kingdom. This tax would apply from April 1, 2020. The 2% DST would apply to gross revenue of specified digital business models deriving value from participation of their U.K.-based users. While the tax is intended to apply to search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces, it may be applied to online advertising when the users of our publications receive advertising based on their participation with the publication. If the DST is enacted, we may have to pay additional cash taxes which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nAdditional Risks Related to Our Business\nOur business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations, which affects our revenues and operating results.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that we expect to continue to be reflected in our operating results in future periods. Our first fiscal quarter of the year tends to be our weakest quarter because advertising volume is at its lowest levels\nfollowing the December holiday season. Correspondingly, our second and fourth fiscal quarters tend to be our strongest because they include heavy holiday and seasonal advertising. Other factors that affect our quarterly revenues and operating results may be beyond our control, including changes in the pricing policies of our competitors, the hiring and retention of key personnel, wage and cost pressures, distribution costs, changes in newsprint prices and general economic factors.\nWe could be adversely affected by an increase in the price of newsprint or a reduction in the availability of newsprint.\nA basic raw material for our publications is newsprint. We generally maintain a 45 to 55-day inventory of newsprint. An inability to obtain an adequate supply of newsprint at a favorable price or at all could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce our publications. Recent and future consolidation of major newsprint suppliers may adversely affect price competition among suppliers. Tariffs, duties and other restrictions on non-U.S. suppliers of newsprint have increased and may in the future increase the price of newsprint and/or limit the supply of available newsprint. Significant increases in newsprint costs for properties and periods not covered by our newsprint vendor agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of our intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating results.\nAt December 31, 2019 the carrying value of our goodwill was $914.3 million, the carrying value of mastheads was $178.6 million, and the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets was $834.0 million. The indefinite-lived assets (goodwill and mastheads) are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in our circumstances that indicate all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary in the relevant period. We may subsequently experience market pressures which could cause future cash flows to decline below our current expectations, or volatile equity markets could negatively impact market factors used in the impairment analysis, including earnings multiples, discount rates, and long-term growth rates. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe performed assessments for possible impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in connection with the Legacy Gannett acquisition and as of December 31, 2019. For the impairment assessments performed for the fourth quarter of 2019, the fair value of the Domestic Publishing and Marketing Solutions reporting units were less than 10% greater than the carrying value. Management assumptions used to calculate fair value of the reporting units involves forward looking financial information and subjectivity. Changes in key assumptions impacting the analyses could have resulted in the recognition of additional impairment. For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 6 - Goodwill and other intangible assets.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business, or changes in applicable accounting rules. We cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future. We have previously discovered a material weakness with respect to a prior period for which we had previously believed that internal controls were effective. See \u201cOur management and independent auditors have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and we may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate controls in future periods, which may lead to errors or omissions in our financial statements\u201d below. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our management and our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us by, for example, a decline in our share price and impairing our ability to raise capital, if and when desirable.\nOur management and independent auditors have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and we may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate controls in future periods, which may lead to errors or omissions in our financial statements.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and regulations require that management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and assess the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. Maintaining and adapting our internal controls is expensive and requires significant management attention. Moreover, as we continue to grow, our internal controls may become more complex and require additional resources to ensure they remain effective amid dynamic regulatory and other guidance.\nAs described in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this 2019 Form 10-K, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2019 and that we had, as of such date, a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to internal control deficiencies over the revenue recognition process; specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls due to the aggregation of control deficiencies related to inadequate manual preventative and detective controls and information technology general controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This material weakness identified did not result in any adjustments or restatements of our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements or disclosures for any prior period previously reported by the Company. However, until the material weakness is remediated and our associated disclosure controls and procedures improved, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting occur in the future, our future consolidated financial statements or other information filed with the SEC may contain material misstatements.\nWe are in the process of remediating the material weakness, but our efforts may not be successful. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness in an appropriate and timely manner, or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, our ability to accurately record, process, and report financial information and consequently, our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in violations of applicable securities laws, stock exchange listing requirements, and the covenants under our debt agreements, subject us to litigation and investigations, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements, and adversely impact our stock price and ability to access capital markets.\nWe are evaluating and developing a plan, which will include the implementation of appropriate processes and controls to remediate the material weakness described above. While we work toward the design and implementation of these processes and controls, we may rely significantly on manual procedures to assist us with meeting the objectives otherwise fulfilled by an effective control environment. The implementation of new procedures and controls could be costly and distract management from other activities.\nWe may not be able to protect intellectual property rights upon which our business relies and, if we lose intellectual property protection, our assets may lose value.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, including, but not limited to, our titles, mastheads, content and proprietary software, which we may attempt to protect through patents, copyrights, trade laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements. We believe our proprietary and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our content, services and other intellectual property, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent any misappropriation or confusion among consumers and merchants, or unauthorized use of these rights. If we are unable to procure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, we may not realize the full value of these assets, and our business may suffer. If we must litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of third parties, such litigation may be costly and divert the attention of our management from day-to-day operations.\nWe are subject to environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant compliance expenditures and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the environment, storage tanks and the management and disposal of wastes at our facilities. Under various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for contamination resulting from the release or threatened release of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum at that property. Such laws often impose liability on the owner or operator without regard to fault, and the costs of any required investigation or cleanup can be substantial. Although in connection with certain of our acquisitions we have rights to indemnification for certain environmental liabilities, these rights may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all losses that we might incur if a property acquired by us has environmental contamination. In addition, although in connection with certain of our acquisitions we have obtained insurance policies for coverage for certain potential environmental liabilities, these policies have express exclusions to coverage as well as express limits on amounts of coverage and length of term. Accordingly, these insurance policies may not be sufficient to provide coverage for us for all losses that we might incur if a property acquired by us has environmental contamination.\nOur operations are also subject to various employee safety and health laws and regulations, including those pertaining to occupational injury and illness, employee exposure to hazardous materials and employee complaints. Environmental and employee safety and health laws tend to be complex, comprehensive and frequently changing. As a result, we may be involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and investigations related to environmental and employee safety and health issues. These proceedings and investigations could result in substantial costs to us, divert our management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop our real property. Furthermore, if it is determined that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or if our properties are contaminated, it could result in significant liabilities, fines or the suspension or interruption of the operations of specific printing facilities.\nFuture events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, new laws or regulations or the discovery of conditions not currently known to us, may give rise to additional compliance or remedial costs that could be material.\nOur possession and use of personal information and the use of payment cards by our customers present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized access to or disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to liabilities and costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nOur online systems store and process confidential subscriber and other sensitive data, such as names, email addresses, addresses, and other personal information. Therefore, maintaining our network security is critical. Additionally, we depend on the security of our third-party service providers. Unauthorized use of or inappropriate access to our, or our third-party service providers\u2019 networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including payment card (credit or debit) information, of our customers. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Non-technical means, for example, actions by an employee, can also result in a data breach. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our proprietary information or the information of our customers or users, cause interruption in our operations, or damage our computers or those of our customers or users. As a result of any such breaches, customers or users may assert claims of liability against us and these activities may subject us to legal claims, adversely impact our reputation, and interfere with our ability to provide our products and services, all of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nA significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all amounts charged by us. These customers provide payment card information and other personally identifiable information which, depending on the particular payment plan, may be maintained to facilitate future payment card transactions. Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the banks that issue the payment cards for their related expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give our customers the option of using payment cards. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be seriously harmed.\nThere can be no assurance that any security measures we, or our third-party service providers, take will be effective in preventing a data breach. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our\nsecurity measures could be harmed and we could lose customers or users. Failure to protect confidential customer data or to provide customers with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to liabilities imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies or courts. We could also be subject to evolving state laws that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could incur significant liability if the separation of Legacy Gannett from its former parent were determined to be a taxable transaction.\nIn connection with the separation of Legacy Gannett from its former parent, Legacy Gannett\u2019s former parent received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code would be satisfied. The opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from our former parent and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings were incorrect or not satisfied, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Further, notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine upon audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings were incorrect or violated, if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of Legacy Gannett or its former parent after the separation. If the separation were determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Legacy Gannett\u2019s former parent and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities.\nThe Internal Revenue Service may disallow all or part of a worthless stock loss and bad debt deduction.\nThe IRS could challenge an election made in 2017 to treat one of our ReachLocal international subsidiaries as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which resulted in worthless stock and bad debt deductions of $101.0 million, yielding a tax benefit of $32.0 million. These tax deductions are subject to audit and possible adjustment by the IRS, which could result in the reversal of all or part of the income tax benefit. To account for this uncertainty, a reserve of $11.0 million has been established to reduce the benefit to an estimated realizable value of $21.0 million. While we believe this represents our best estimate of the benefit to be realized upon final acceptance of our tax return, the IRS could reject or reduce the amount of tax benefit related to these deductions. If the IRS rejects or reduces the amount of this income tax benefit, we may have to pay additional cash income taxes, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we receive, if any, will be.\nWe may not be able to generate future taxable income which may prevent our realization of deferred tax assets.\nWe have released valuation allowance of $46.9 million relating to federal deferred tax assets. If we do not have taxable income in future years, we may be required to reestablish a valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets.\nRisks Related to Pension Obligations and Employees\nWe are required to use a portion of our cash flows to make contributions to our pension plans, which diverts cash flow from operations, and the amount of required future contributions may be difficult to estimate.\nWe, along with our subsidiaries, sponsor various defined benefit retirement plans, including plans established under collective bargaining agreements. Our retirement plans include (i) the Gannett Retirement Plan (GRP), (ii) the Gannett 2015 Supplemental Retirement Plan, (iii) the Newsquest Pension Scheme in the U.K., (iv) the Newspaper Guild of Detroit Pension Plan, (v) a supplemental retirement plan we assumed pursuant to our acquisition of JMG, (vi) the George W. Prescott pension plan, and (vii) The Times Publishing Company pension plan.\nOur pension plans invest in a variety of equity and debt securities. Future volatility and disruption in the equity and bond markets could cause declines in the asset values of our pension plans. For many of our retirement plans, our pension benefit obligations exceed the value of pension assets. As of December 31, 2019, our retirement plans were underfunded by a total of $116.9 million on a U.S. GAAP basis.\nThe excess of pension benefit obligations over assets is expected to give rise to required pension contributions over the next several years. We have committed to make a contribution of $35.8 million to the GRP in 2020, as well as a $15.0 million contribution in 2021. We expect to contribute approximately $26.3 million to the U.K. Pension Plans in 2020, and $24.3\nmillion in 2021. Our ability to make contribution payments will depend on our future cash flows, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. Various factors, including future investment returns, interest rates, and potential pension legislative changes, may impact the timing and amount of future pension contributions. In addition, decreases in the discount rate used to determine minimum funding requirements could result in increased future contributions. As a result, we may need to make additional pension contributions above what is currently estimated, which could reduce the cash available for our businesses.\nWe depend on key personnel and we may not be able to operate or grow our business effectively if we lose the services of any of our key personnel or are unable to attract qualified personnel in the future.\nThe success of our business is heavily dependent on our ability to retain our management and other key personnel and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management personnel is intense, and we may not be able to retain our key personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our key personnel, these agreements do not ensure that our key personnel will continue in their present capacity with us for any particular period of time. We do not have key man insurance for any of our current management or other key personnel. The loss of any key personnel would require our remaining key personnel to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement. An inability to find a suitable replacement for any departing executive officer on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to operate or grow our business. On January 6, 2020, we announced that our Chief Financial Officer will resign as of the end of the first quarter of 2020. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner.\nA shortage of skilled or experienced employees in the media industry, or our inability to retain such employees, could pose a risk to achieving improved productivity and reducing costs, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nProduction and distribution of our various publications requires skilled and experienced employees. A shortage of such employees, or our inability to retain such employees, could have an adverse impact on our productivity and costs, our ability to expand, develop and distribute new products and our entry into new markets. The cost of retaining or hiring such employees could exceed our expectations which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA number of our employees are unionized, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if current or additional labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we employed 21,255 employees, of whom 2,807 (or approximately 13%) were represented by seven unions. 51% of the unionized employees are in four states: Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana and represent 15%, 12%, 13% and 11% of all our union employees, respectively.\nAlthough our newspapers have not experienced a union strike in the recent past nor do we anticipate a union strike to occur, we cannot preclude the possibility that a strike may occur at one or more of our newspapers at some point in the future. We believe that, in the event of a newspaper strike, we would be able to continue to publish and deliver to subscribers, which is critical to retaining advertising and circulation revenues, although there can be no assurance of this. Further, settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs, productivity and flexibility.\nSustained increases in costs of employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.\nIn recent years, we have experienced significant increases in the cost of employee benefits because of economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs. At least some of these factors may continue to put upward pressure on the cost of providing medical benefits. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses.\nRisks Related to Our Manager\nThe inability of our Manager to retain or obtain key personnel could delay or hinder implementation of our investment strategies, which could impair our ability to make distributions and could reduce the value of your investment.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and certain other individuals who perform services for us are employees of our Manager. We are reliant on our Manager, which has significant discretion as to the implementation of our operating policies and strategies, to\nconduct our business. We are dependent on the services of certain key employees of our Manager whose compensation may be partially or entirely dependent upon the amount of incentive or management compensation earned by our Manager and whose continued service is not guaranteed, and the loss of such services could adversely affect our operations. If any of these people were to cease their affiliation with us or our Manager, either we or our Manager may be unable to find suitable replacements, and our operating results could suffer.\nBecause we are dependent upon our Manager and its affiliates to conduct our operations, any adverse changes in the financial health of our Manager or its affiliates, or in our relationship with them, could hinder our Manager\u2019s ability to successfully manage our operations.\nWe are dependent on our Manager and its affiliates to manage our operations and acquire and manage our investments. Under the direction of our Board of Directors, our Manager makes decisions with respect to the management of our company. To conduct its operations, our Manager depends upon the fees and other compensation that it receives from us in connection with managing our company and from other entities and investors with respect to investment management services it provides. Any adverse changes in the financial condition of our Manager or its affiliates, or our relationship with our Manager, could hinder our Manager\u2019s ability to successfully manage our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. For example, adverse changes in the financial condition of our Manager could limit its ability to attract key personnel.\nThere are conflicts of interest in our relationship with our Manager.\nOur Management Agreement with our Manager was not negotiated between unaffiliated parties, and its terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.\nThere are conflicts of interest inherent in our relationship with our Manager insofar as our Manager and its affiliates-including investment funds, private investment funds, or businesses managed by our Manager-invest in media assets and whose investment objectives may overlap with our investment objectives. Certain investments appropriate for us may also be appropriate for one or more of these other investment vehicles. Certain members of our Board of Directors and employees of our Manager who may also be our officers also serve as officers and/or directors of these other entities. Although we have the same Manager, we may compete with entities affiliated with our Manager or Fortress for certain target assets. From time to time, affiliates of Fortress may focus on investments in assets with a similar profile as our target assets that we may seek to acquire. These affiliates may have meaningful purchasing capacity, which may change over time depending upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, available equity capital and debt financing, market conditions and cash on hand. In addition, with respect to Fortress funds in the process of selling investments, our Manager may be incentivized to regard the sale of such assets to us positively, particularly if a sale to an unrelated third party would result in a loss of fees to our Manager.\nOur Management Agreement with our Manager does not prevent our Manager or any of its affiliates, or any of their officers and employees, from engaging in other businesses or from rendering services of any kind to any other person or entity, including investment in, or advisory service to others investing in, any type of media or media related investment, including investments that meet our principal investment objectives. Our Manager may engage in additional investment opportunities related to media assets in the future, which may cause our Manager to compete with us for investments or result in a change in our current investment strategy. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that if Fortress or an affiliate or any of their officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or our affiliates. In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of Fortress or its affiliates acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person\u2019s capacity as a director or officer of ours and such person acts in good faith, then to the fullest extent permitted by law such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person\u2019s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us if Fortress or its affiliates pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if such person did not present the corporate opportunity to us.\nThe ability of our Manager and its officers and employees to engage in other business activities, subject to the terms of our Management Agreement with our Manager, may reduce the amount of time that our Manager, its officers or other employees spend managing us. In addition, we may engage in material transactions with our Manager or another entity managed by our Manager or one of its affiliates, which may present an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest. It is possible that actual, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor dissatisfaction, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which could\nmaterially adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including causing an inability to raise additional funds, a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us, a decrease in the prices of our equity securities and a resulting increased risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nThe management compensation structure that we have agreed to with our Manager, as well as compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our Manager in the future (in connection with new lines of business or other activities), may incentivize our Manager to invest in high risk investments. In addition to its management fee, our Manager is currently entitled to receive incentive compensation. In evaluating investments and other management strategies, the opportunity to earn incentive compensation may lead our Manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of such measures at the expense of other criteria, such as preservation of capital, in order to achieve higher incentive compensation. Investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative than lower-yielding investments.\nOur Board of Directors does not approve each investment decision made by our Manager. In addition, we may change our investment strategy without a stockholder vote, which may result in our making investments that are different, riskier or less profitable than our current investments.\nOur Manager has great latitude in determining the types and categories of assets it may decide are proper investments for us, including the latitude to invest in types and categories of assets that may differ from those in which we currently invest. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews our investment portfolio. However, our Board of Directors does not review or pre-approve each proposed investment or our related financing arrangements. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, our Board of Directors relies primarily on information provided to them by our Manager. Furthermore, transactions entered into by our Manager may be difficult or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by our Board of Directors even if the transactions contravene the terms of the Management Agreement. In addition, we may change our investment strategy, including our target asset classes, without a stockholder vote.\nOur investment strategy may evolve in light of existing market conditions and investment opportunities, and this evolution may involve additional risks depending upon the nature of the assets in which we invest and our ability to finance such assets on a short- or long-term basis. Investment opportunities that present unattractive risk-return profiles relative to other available investment opportunities under particular market conditions may become relatively attractive under changed market conditions, and changes in market conditions may therefore result in changes in the investments we target. Decisions to make investments in new asset categories present risks that may be difficult for us to adequately assess and could therefore reduce our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or have adverse effects on our liquidity or financial condition. A change in our investment strategy may also increase our exposure to interest rate, real estate market or credit market fluctuations. In addition, a change in our investment strategy may increase the guarantee obligations we agree to incur or increase the number of transactions we enter into with affiliates. Our failure to accurately assess the risks inherent in new asset categories or the financing risks associated with such assets could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur Manager will not be liable to us for any acts or omissions performed in accordance with the Management Agreement, including with respect to the performance of our investments.\nPursuant to our Management Agreement, our Manager assumes no responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder in good faith and shall not be responsible for any action of our Board of Directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. Our Manager, its members, managers, officers and employees will not be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries, to our Board of Directors, or our or any subsidiary\u2019s stockholders or partners for any acts or omissions by our Manager, its members, managers, officers or employees, except by reason of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of our Manager\u2019s duties under our Management Agreement. We shall, to the full extent lawful, reimburse, indemnify and hold our Manager, its members, managers, officers and employees, and each other person, if any, controlling our Manager, harmless of and from any and all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims of any nature whatsoever (including attorneys\u2019 fees) in respect of or arising from any acts or omissions of an indemnified party made in good faith in the performance of our Manager\u2019s duties under our Management Agreement and not constituting such indemnified party\u2019s bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of our Manager\u2019s duties under our Management Agreement.\nOur Manager\u2019s due diligence of investment opportunities or other transactions may not identify all pertinent risks, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur Manager intends to conduct due diligence with respect to each investment opportunity or other transaction it pursues. It is possible, however, that our Manager\u2019s due diligence processes will not uncover all relevant facts, particularly with respect to any assets we acquire from third parties. In these cases, our Manager may be given limited access to information about the\ninvestment and will rely on information provided by the target of the investment. In addition, if investment opportunities are scarce, the process for selecting bidders is competitive, or the timeframe in which we are required to complete diligence is short, our ability to conduct a due diligence investigation may be limited, and we would be required to make investment decisions based upon a less thorough diligence process than would otherwise be the case. Accordingly, investments and other transactions that initially appear to be viable may prove not to be over time, due to the limitations of the due diligence process or other factors.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThere can be no assurance that the market for our stock will provide adequate liquidity.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nOur business profile and market capitalization may not fit the investment objectives of any stockholder;\n\u2022\nA shift in our investor base;\n\u2022\nOur quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nThe failure of securities analysts to cover our Common Stock;\n\u2022\nChanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nThe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\nNegative public perception of us, our competitors, or industry;\n\u2022\nOverall market fluctuations; and\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions.\nStock markets in general and recently have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Common Stock to fluctuate, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of Common Stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nSales or issuances of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nSales or issuances of substantial amounts of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales or issuances might occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. The issuance of our common stock in connection with property, portfolio or business acquisitions or the settlement of awards that may be granted under our Incentive Plans (as defined below) or otherwise could also have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in accordance with our announced intent or at all.\nWe have announced our intent to distribute a portion of our free cash flow generated from operations or other sources as a quarterly dividend to the holders of our Common Stock, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our Board of Directors and restrictions in our credit facility.\nUnder our credit facility, we are prohibited from paying cash dividends until after the thirtieth day of the second full fiscal quarter after the closing of the Legacy Gannett acquisition (i.e., April 30), and after such date, we can only pay cash dividends up to an agreed-upon amount, provided the ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the credit facility) does not exceed a specified ratio. For these and other reasons generally affecting the ability to pay dividends, our stockholders will not receive dividends in an amount equal to the amount paid prior to the acquisition. Stockholders also should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared.\nThe Board of Directors\u2019 determinations regarding dividends will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company\u2019s GAAP net income, free cash flow generated from operations or other sources, liquidity position and potential alternative uses of\ncash, such as acquisitions, as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results. There can be no guarantee regarding the timing and amount of any dividends. Our ability to declare future dividends will depend on our future financial performance, which in turn depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial, competitive, regulatory, technical and other factors, general economic conditions, demand and selling prices for our products and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects, many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, our ability to generate free cash flow depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs, capital expenditures or debt servicing requirements.\nThe percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be diluted in the future.\nWe have issued and may continue to issue equity in order to raise capital or in connection with future acquisitions and strategic investments, which would dilute investors\u2019 percentage ownership in Gannett. In addition, your percentage ownership may be diluted if we issue equity instruments such as debt and equity financing.\nThe percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may also be diluted in the future as result of the issuance of ordinary shares in Gannett upon the exercise of 10-year warrants (the \u201cGannett Warrants\u201d). The Gannett Warrants collectively represent the right to acquire Gannett Common Stock, which in the aggregate are equal to 5% of Gannett Common Stock outstanding as of November 26, 2013 (calculated prior to dilution from shares of Gannett Common Stock issued pursuant to Drive Shack Inc.'s (formerly known as Newcastle Investment Corp.) contribution of Local Media Group Holdings LLC and assignment of related stock purchase agreement to Gannett (the \u201cLocal Media Contribution\u201d)) at a strike price of $46.35 calculated based on a total equity value of Gannett prior to the Local Media Contribution of $1.2 billion as of November 26, 2013. As a result, Gannett Common Stock may be subject to dilution upon the exercise of such Gannett Warrants. As of December 31, 2019, the Gannett Warrants are equal to 1% of Gannett Common Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2019 at a strike price of $46.35.\nFurthermore, the percentage ownership in Gannett may be diluted in the future because of options issued to our Manager. As of December 31, 2019, there are 6,068,075 options outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $14.70.\nDilution may also result from the issuances of shares under our equity compensation plans (our \"Incentive Plans\"), which provide for the grant of equity and equity-based awards, including restricted stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, and other equity-based and non-equity based awards, in each case to our directors, officers, employees, among others. As of December 31, 2019, the number of shares reserved for issuance under our Incentive Plans was 15.0 million.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our Common Stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions provide for:\n\u2022\nAmendment of provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws regarding the election of directors, classes of directors, the term of office of directors, the filling of director vacancies and the resignation and removal of directors only upon the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the then issued and outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon;\n\u2022\nAmendment of provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding corporate opportunity only upon the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the then issued and outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon;\n\u2022\nRemoval of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nOur Board to determine the powers, preferences and rights of our preferred stock and to issue such preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws prevent stockholders from calling special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nAdvance notice requirements applicable to stockholders for director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;\n\u2022\nA prohibition, in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, stating that no holder of shares of our Common Stock will have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, which means that the holders of majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock can elect all the directors standing for election; and\n\u2022\nAction by our stockholders outside a meeting, in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, only by unanimous written consent.\nPublic stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is considered favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or a change in our management and Board and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and your ability to realize any potential change of control premium.\nWe are not required to repurchase our common stock, and any such repurchases may not result in effects we anticipated.\nWe have authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $100 million of the Company's common stock through May 19, 2020, subject to certain restrictions in the Company's Credit Facility. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, depends on several factors, including market and business conditions, the market price of shares of our common stock and our overall capital structure and liquidity position, including the nature of other potential uses of cash, not limited to investments in growth. There can be no assurance that any repurchases will have the effects we anticipated, and our repurchases will utilize cash that we will not be able to use in other ways, whether to grow the business or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 14490, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "GCI"}
