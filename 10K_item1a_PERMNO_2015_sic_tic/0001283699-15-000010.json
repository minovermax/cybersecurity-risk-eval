{"cik": "1283699", "company": "T-Mobile US, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating T-Mobile. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Wireless Industry\nThe scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business strategy and financial planning.\nWe will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth, expand into new metropolitan areas, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands, and deploy new technologies. We will be at a competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain markets if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum before reaching capacity, especially below 1 GHz - low band spectrum.\nThe continued interest in, and aggregation of, spectrum by the largest national carriers may reduce our ability to acquire spectrum from other carriers or otherwise negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means. As a result, we may need to acquire spectrum through government auctions and/or enter into spectrum sharing arrangements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. For example, the FCC has encountered resistance to its plans to make additional spectrum available, which has created uncertainty about the timing and availability of spectrum through government auctions.\nIn addition, the FCC may impose conditions on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum, including new restrictions or rules governing the use or access to current or future spectrum. This could increase pressure on capacity. Additional conditions that may be imposed by the FCC include heightened build-out requirements, limited renewal rights, clearing obligations, or open access or net neutrality requirements that may make it less attractive or less economical to acquire spectrum. The FCC has a pending notice of proposed rulemaking to examine whether the current spectrum screen used in acquisitions of spectrum should be changed or whether a spectrum cap should be imposed. In addition, rules may be established for future government spectrum auctions that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas.\nIf we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if new competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at adequate cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, then our ability to attract and retain customers and our associated financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreasing competition for wireless customers could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have multiple wireless competitors in each of our service areas, some of which have greater resources than us, and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, call quality, data use experience, coverage area, and customer service. In addition, we are facing growing competition from providers offering services using alternative wireless technologies and IP-based networks, as well as traditional wireline networks. We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry\u2019s customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates or possibly negative, leading to increased competition for customers. We also expect that our customers\u2019 growing appetite for data services will place increased demands on our network capacity. This competition and our capacity issues will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. Our ability to compete will depend on, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer services, effective marketing and selling of products and services, attractive pricing, and cost management, all of which will involve significant expenses.\nJoint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the wireless industry have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. The two largest national wireless communication providers currently serve a significant percentage of all wireless customers and hold significant spectrum and other resources. Our largest competitors may be able to enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours. In addition, the refusal of our large competitors to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming services on reasonable terms, may improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile services industry. These factors, together with the effects of the increasing\naggregate penetration of wireless services in all metropolitan areas and the ability of our larger competitors to use resources to build out their networks and to quickly deploy advanced technologies, have made it more difficult for smaller carriers like us to attract and retain customers, and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, employee, supplier or other proprietary or sensitive information are not successful at preventing a regulatory investigation, significant data breach or failure of compliance, we could incur substantial additional costs, become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and suffer reputational damage.\nOur business, like that of most retailers and wireless companies, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, consumer preferences and payment card information, as well as confidential information about our employees, our suppliers and our Company (\u201cconfidential information\u201d). Cyber-attacks such as denial of service, other malicious attacks, unauthorized access or distribution of confidential information by third parties or employees, errors by third party suppliers or other breaches of security could disrupt our internal systems and applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers or protect the privacy and confidentiality of our confidential information. Our information systems are vulnerable to continuously evolving data breach and information security risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees or third party service providers. Hardware, software or applications we develop, have developed on our behalf, or we obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could compromise information security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time.\nAlthough we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of sensitive data and to prevent data loss, the ever-evolving threats require us to continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes. We cannot assure you that our systems and processes will be adequate to safeguard against all information security breaches or misuses of data. The actions we take may not be adequate to repel a significant attack or prevent a breach, unauthorized access by third parties or employees or errors by third party suppliers. If we are subject to a significant attack or breach, unauthorized access, errors of third party suppliers or other security breaches, we may incur significant costs, be subject to regulatory investigations and sanctions and private litigation, and may suffer damage to our business reputation that negatively impacts customer confidence, any or all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reputation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by system failures, business disruptions, and unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems.\nTo be successful, we must provide our customers with reliable, trustworthy service and protect the communications, location, and personal information shared or generated by our customers. We rely upon our systems and networks, and the systems and networks of other providers and suppliers, to provide and support our services and, in some cases, to protect our customers\u2019 and our information. Failure of our or others\u2019 systems, networks and infrastructure may prevent us from providing reliable service, or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our networks and other systems. Examples of these risks include:\n\u2022\nhuman error such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code;\n\u2022\nphysical damage, power surges or outages, or equipment failure, including those as a result of severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and acts of war;\n\u2022\ntheft of customer/proprietary information: intrusion and theft of data offered for sale, competitive (dis)advantage, and/or corporate extortion;\n\u2022\nunauthorized access to our information technology, billing, customer care and provisioning systems and networks, and those of our suppliers and other providers;\n\u2022\nsupplier failures or delays; and\n\u2022\nother systems failures or outages.\nSuch events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational and goodwill damages, and subject us to litigation or governmental investigation. Remediation costs could include liability for information loss, repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. Our insurance may not cover, or be adequate to fully reimburse us for, costs and losses associated with such events.\nWe rely on third-parties to provide specialized products or services for the operation of our business, and a failure or inability by such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe depend heavily on suppliers and other third parties in order for us to efficiently operate our business. Our business is complex, and it is not unusual for multiple vendors located in multiple locations to help us to develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services, such as network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. Our suppliers often provide services outside of the U.S., which carries associated additional regulatory and legal obligations. We generally rely upon the suppliers to provide contractual assurances and accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our expectations and standards, and they may fail to do so.\nGenerally, there are multiple sources for the types of products and services we purchase or use. However, we currently rely on one key supplier for billing services, a limited number of suppliers for voice and data communications transport services, network infrastructure, equipment, handsets, and other devices, and payment processing services, among other products and services we rely on. Disruptions with respect to such suppliers, or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform, could have a material adverse on our financial performance.\nIn the past, our suppliers, contractors and third-party retailers have not always performed at the levels we expect or at the levels required by their contracts. Our business could be severely disrupted if key suppliers, contractors, service providers, or third-party retailers fail to comply with their contracts or become unable to continue the supply due to patent or other intellectual property infringement actions, or other disruptions. Our business could also be disrupted if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier, or we were required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are in the process of transferring our customer billing systems from our existing third-party vendor to a new third-party vendor. Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business.\nWe are in the initial stages of implementing a new customer billing system, which involves moving to a new platform through utilization of a phased deployment approach. The first release phase is scheduled for 2015. Post implementation, we plan to operate both the existing and new billing systems in parallel to aid in the transition to the new system until all phases of the conversion are complete.\nIf the implementation causes major system disruptions or if we fail to implement the new billing system in a timely or effective manner, customer experience may be negatively impacted, which could cause material adverse effects on our operational and financial performance. In addition, the third-party billing services vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of this new billing services system could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers or attract new customers. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and reputational damage.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain wireless subscribers our financial performance will be impaired.\nWe incur capital expenditures and operating expenses in order to improve and enhance our products, services, network quality and coverage, applications, and content to remain competitive and to keep up with our customer demand. If we fail to improve and enhance our products and services or expand the capacity of, or make upgrades to, our network to remain competitive, or if we fail to maintain access to desired handsets, content and features, or otherwise keep up with customer demand, our ability to attract and retain customers would be adversely affected.\nIn particular, our gross new subscriber activations may decrease and our subscriber churn may increase, leaving us unable to meet the assumptions of our business plan. Even if we effectively manage the factors described above that are within our control, there can be no assurance that our existing customers will not switch to another wireless communications provider or that we will be able to attract new customers. Our business, results of operations and financial condition, could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to grow our customer base at the levels we project, or achieve the aggregate levels of customer penetration that we currently believe are possible with our business model.\nIf we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, then we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy.\nIn order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers\u2019 changing demands. For example, we are in the process of transforming and upgrading our network to deploy LTE Release 10 and use multimode integrated radios that can handle GSM, HSPA+ and LTE. As part of our network upgrade program, we expect to install new GSM, HSPA+, and LTE equipment on approximately 40,000 cell sites, and GSM and LTE on approximately 12,000 cell sites. This work is planned to be substantially completed in 2015. However, enhancing our network is subject to risk from equipment changes and migration of customers from existing spectrum bands. Scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, subscriber dissatisfaction, and other risks could cause delays in launching new network capabilities, which could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. As it relates to our current upgrade plans, these risks will be reduced as work is completed. In general, the development of new services in the wireless telecommunications industry will require us to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demands of our customers, which we may not be able to do accurately or timely. We could experience a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial position, and operating results if our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness include restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions and incurrence-based ratio tests, may limit our ability to engage in some transactions, including the following:\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;\n\u2022\npaying dividends, redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payments or investments;\n\u2022\nselling or buying assets, properties or licenses;\n\u2022\ndeveloping assets, properties or licenses which we have or in the future may procure;\n\u2022\ncreating liens on assets;\n\u2022\nparticipating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum;\n\u2022\nengaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations, or other transactions;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nplacing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to react to changes in our operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these agreements and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds and to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and performance.\nOur significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt, to repay our existing indebtedness when due, and to fund operations and significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is in turn subject to the operational risks described elsewhere in this section. Our debt service obligations could have material adverse effects on our operations and financial results, including by:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow money, sell stock or similar equity linked securities to fund our operational, financing or strategic needs;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the communications industry or pursuing growth opportunities;\n\u2022\nreducing the amount of cash available for other operational or strategic needs; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors who are less leveraged than we are.\nIn addition, the $5.6 billion in principal amount of the senior reset notes we issued to Deutsche Telekom in connection with the business combination between T-Mobile and MetroPCS bears interest at rates which will be reset at dates between April 2015 and April 2016. If the resets result in interest rate increases, debt service requirements will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow. While we have and may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates in the future,\nany such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk, and any portion not subject to such agreements would have full exposure to higher interest rates. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nEconomic and market conditions may adversely affect our business and financial performance, as well as our access to financing on favorable terms or at all.\nOur business and financial performance are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, energy costs and other macro-economic factors. Market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging in recent years. Concerns about the systemic impact of a long-term downturn, underemployment and unemployment, energy costs, the availability and cost of credit and unstable housing and credit markets have contributed to market volatility and economic uncertainty.\nContinued or renewed market turbulence and weak economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance in a number of ways. Our services are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be more vulnerable to weak economic conditions. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service due to an inability to pay. In addition, instability in the global financial markets has resulted in periodic volatility in the credit, equity, and fixed income markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nWeak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers and dealers, some of which have filed for or may be considering bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems or are unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services. Difficult, or worsening, general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal controls are not effective.\nAs a public company, we are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to establish, maintain and annually evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, which is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The information technology, or IT, systems on which we rely extensively to operate, transact and otherwise manage our business and to effectively and timely report our financial results, are an important part of our internal control over financial reporting. Each each year we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting, including these IT systems; our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not discover material weaknesses our IT controls or other aspects of our internal control over financial reporting in the future. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify these or other internal control deficiencies. If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or if we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nOur financial performance will be impaired if we experience high fraud rates related to device financing, credit cards, dealers, or subscriptions.\nOur operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including device financing, customer credit card, subscription or dealer fraud. If our fraud detection strategies and processes are not successful in detecting and controlling fraud, whether directly or by way of the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers and others, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on highly-skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture.\nWe believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, competitors\u2019 hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and in attracting new key personnel, we may be unable to meet our business plan and, as a result, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nRisk related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe operate throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and as such are subject to regulatory and legislative action by applicable local, state and federal governmental entities, which may increase our costs of providing products or services, or require us to change our business operations, products, or services or subject us to material adverse impacts if we fail to comply with such regulations.\nThe FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and other federal agencies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Board (\u201cCFPB\u201d), have jurisdiction over consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. We cannot assure you that the FCC, FTC, CFPB or any other federal, state or local agencies having jurisdiction over our business will not adopt regulations or take other enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations. We are subject to regulatory oversight by the FCC, FTC, and/or other federal agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to: roaming, spectrum allocation and licensing, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d), net neutrality, special access, 911 services, consumer protection including cramming, bill shock, and handset unlocking, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including handset financing activities.\nIn addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communication providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. A number of state Public Utility Commissions and state legislatures have introduced proposals in recent years seeking to regulate carriers\u2019 business practices. We also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state Public Utility Commissions and state Attorneys General. We also cannot assure you that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business. Enactment of additional state or federal regulations may increase our costs of providing services (including, through universal service programs, requiring us to subsidize wireline competitors) or require us to change our services. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our licenses) for failure to comply with FCC or other governmental regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nUnfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are regularly involved in a number of legal proceedings before various state and federal courts, the FCC, the FTC, the CFPB, and state and local regulatory agencies. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The outcome of litigation or other legal proceedings, including amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement, may differ materially from amounts accrued in the financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or ability to do business.\nWe increasingly offer products that include highly regulated financial services. These products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations.\nThe introduction of additional financial services offerings to our customers has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. If we fail to remain compliant with any of these regulations, then we face the risk of:\n\u2022\nIncreased consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the CFPB, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and FTC;\n\u2022\nViolation of financial services and consumer protections regulations may result in regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property. Additionally, we use equipment, software, technology, and content in the operation of our business, which may subject us to third-party intellectual property claims and we may be adversely affected by litigation involving our suppliers\nWe rely on a combination of patent, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary rights. Moreover, others may independently develop processes and technologies that are competitive to ours. We cannot be sure that any legal actions against such infringers will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. We cannot assure you that our pending or future patent applications will be granted or enforceable, or that the rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide us with any competitive advantages. In addition, we cannot assure you that any trademark or service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or will provide adequate protection of our brands. We do not have insurance coverage for intellectual property losses, and as such, a charge for an anticipated settlement, or an adverse ruling awarding damages, represents unplanned loss events. Any of these factors could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a defendant in numerous intellectual property lawsuits, including patent infringement lawsuits, which exposes us to the risk of adverse financial impact either by way of significant settlement amounts or damage awards. As we adopt new technologies and new business systems, and provide customers with new products and/or services, we may face additional infringement claims. These claims could require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling relevant products and services. These claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend, and divert management resources. In addition to litigation directly involving our Company, our vendors and suppliers can be threatened with patent litigation and/or subjected to the threat of disruption or blockage of sale, use, or importation of products, posing the risk of supply chain interruption to particular products and associated services exposing us to material adverse operational and financial impacts.\nOur business may be impacted by new or changing tax laws or regulations and actions by federal, state or local agencies, or how judicial authorities apply tax laws.\nWe calculate, collect, and remit various taxes and regulatory fees to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities in connection with the products and services we provide. These fees include federal USF contributions and common carrier regulatory fees. Many state and local governments levy various taxes and fees on our sales of products and services to customers and on our purchases of telecommunications equipment and services from vendors and various telecommunications carriers. Further, we impose surcharges on customers to reimburse the company for taxes, regulatory assessments and other costs we incur to comply with governmental regulatory mandates. In many cases, the applicability and method of calculating these surcharges, taxes and fees may be uncertain, and our calculation, assessment or remittance of these amounts may be contested by either customers or governmental authorities. In the event that we have incorrectly described, disclosed, calculated, assessed or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our operations or financial condition. In the event that federal, state and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes and regulatory fees on our services or seek to impose new ones, it could have a material adverse effect on our margins and financial and operational results.\nOur wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws.\nOur existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the 10-year or 15-year period for which they are granted. Historically, the FCC has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. In addition, our licenses are subject to our compliance with the terms set forth in the agreement pertaining to national security among Deutsche Telekom, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the\nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Company. The failure of Deutsche Telekom or the Company to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions, and other penalties, including potential revocation or non-renewal of our spectrum licenses. If we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license, or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. The FCC has pending a rulemaking proceeding to reevaluate, among other things, its wireless license renewal showings and standards and may in this or other proceedings promulgate changes or additional substantial requirements or conditions to its renewal rules, including revising license build out requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by findings of product liability for health/safety risks from wireless devices and transmission equipment, as well as by changes to regulations/radio frequency emission standards.\nWe do not manufacture devices or other equipment sold by us, and we depend on our suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment. Suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria. However, even if the devices we sell meet the regulatory safety criteria, we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products we sell if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects. We generally seek to enter into indemnification agreements with the manufacturers who supply us with devices to protect us from losses associated with product liability, but we cannot guarantee that we will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective.\nAllegations have been made that the use of wireless handsets and wireless transmission equipment, such as cell towers, may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer and brain tumors. Lawsuits have been filed against manufacturers and carriers in the industry claiming damages for alleged health problems arising from the use of wireless handsets. In addition, the FCC recently indicated that it plans to gather additional data regarding wireless handset emissions to update its assessment of this issue. The media has also reported incidents of handset battery malfunction, including reports of batteries that have overheated. These allegations may lead to changes in regulatory standards. There have also been other allegations regarding wireless technology, including allegations that wireless handset emissions may interfere with various electronic medical devices (including hearing aids and pacemakers), airbags, and anti-lock brakes.\nAdditionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment. Concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to sell our wireless services.\nRelated to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe are controlled by Deutsche Telekom, whose interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nDeutsche Telekom beneficially owns and possesses majority voting power of the fully diluted shares of our common stock. Through its control of the voting power of our common stock and the rights granted to Deutsche Telekom in our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholder\u2019s Agreement, Deutsche Telekom controls the election of a majority of our directors and all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. By virtue of Deutsche Telekom\u2019s voting control, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d, as defined in the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), listing rules, and are not subject to NYSE requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors, or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation and the Stockholder\u2019s Agreement restrict us from taking certain actions without Deutsche Telekom\u2019s prior written consent as long as Deutsche Telekom beneficially owns 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including the incurrence of debt (excluding certain permitted debt) if our consolidated ratio of debt to cash flow for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available would exceed 5.25 to 1.0 on a pro forma basis, the acquisition of any business, debt or equity interests, operations or assets of any person for consideration in excess of $1 billion, the sale of any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 divisions, businesses, operations or equity interests for consideration in excess of $1 billion, any change in the size of our board of directors, the issuances of equity securities in excess of 10% of our outstanding shares or to repurchase debt held by Deutsche Telekom, the repurchase or redemption of equity securities or the declaration of extraordinary or in-kind dividends or distributions other than on a pro rata basis, or the termination or hiring of our chief executive officer. These restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that\nour board of directors may otherwise determine are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nDeutsche Telekom effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our certificate of incorporation, a sale or merger of our company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law. Deutsche Telekom may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a substantial amount of our indebtedness, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stakeholders.\nFuture sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales by Deutsche Telekom, could have a negative impact on our stock price.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares or the availability of shares of our common stock will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock from time to time. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe and Deutsche Telekom are parties to the Stockholder\u2019s Agreement pursuant to which Deutsche Telekom is free to transfer its shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in the transferee owning 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If a transfer would exceed the 30% threshold, it is prohibited unless the transferee makes a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. The Stockholder\u2019s Agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by Deutsche Telekom. Moreover, we have filed a shelf registration statement with respect to the common stock and certain debt securities held by Deutsche Telekom, which would facilitate the resale by Deutsche Telekom of all or any portion of the shares of our common stock it holds. The sale of shares of our common stock by Deutsche Telekom (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease in our stock price. In addition, even if Deutsche Telekom does not sell a large number of its shares into the market, its right to transfer a large number of shares into the market may depress our stock price.\nIn addition, we have reserved up to 38.684 million shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of our 5.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A ( \u201cpreferred stock\u201d), subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. The dividends on the preferred stock may also be paid in cash or, subject to certain limitations, shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock upon conversion of, or in connection with the payment of dividends upon, the mandatory convertible preferred stock may depress our stock price.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and may fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe trading prices of the securities of communications companies historically have been highly volatile, and the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in reaction to a number of events and factors that may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nour or our competitors\u2019 actual or anticipated operating and financial results; introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors or changes in service plans or pricing by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nanalyst projections, predictions and forecasts, analyst target prices for our securities and changes in, or our failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nDeutsche Telekom\u2019s financial performance, results of operation, or actions implied or taken by Deutsche Telekom;\n\u2022\nentry of new competitors into our markets or perceptions of increased price competition, including a price war;\n\u2022\nour performance, including subscriber growth, and our financial and operational metric performance;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions relating to our services, network, handsets and deployment of our LTE platform and our access to iconic handsets, services, applications or content;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions of the wireless communications industry and valuation models for us and the industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in our credit rating or future prospects;\n\u2022\nthe availability or perceived availability of additional capital in general and our access to such capital;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated consolidation, or other strategic mergers or acquisition activities involving us or our competitors or market speculations regarding such activities;\n\u2022\ndisruptions of our operations or service providers or other vendors necessary to our network operations; the general state of the U.S. and world economies; and\n\u2022\navailability of additional spectrum, whether by the announcement, commencement, bidding and closing of auctions for new spectrum or the acquisition of companies that own spectrum.\nIn addition, the stock market has been volatile in the recent past and has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which may continue for the foreseeable future. This volatility has had a significant impact on the trading price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the communications industry. These changes frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur stockholder rights plan could prevent a change in control of our Company in instances in which some stockholders may believe a change in control is in their best interests.\nWe have a stockholder rights plan (\u201cRights Plan\u201d) in effect. The Rights Plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire our Company on terms that our board of directors does not believe are in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interest. The Rights Plan is intended to protect stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire the Company and to provide our board of directors with adequate time to evaluate unsolicited offers. The Rights Plan may prevent or make takeovers or unsolicited corporate transactions with respect to our Company more difficult, even if stockholders may consider such transactions favorable, possibly including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 91937, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "TMUS"}
