RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCertain elements of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 formula rates can be and have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Regulated Operating Subsidiaries provide transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC. The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rates used by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries to calculate their respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates. All aspects of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 rates approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the actual equity portion of their respective capital structures and the approved capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative in a proceeding under Section 206 of the FPA. In addition, interested\nparties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries of their projected rates and formula rate true up pursuant to their approved formula rates under the Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 formula rate implementation protocols. End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially. If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC will make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula. This could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts collected, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn November 2013 and February 2015, certain parties filed complaints with the FERC under Section 206 of the FPA, requesting that the FERC find the base rate of return on equity for all MISO transmission owners, including ITCTransmission, METC and ITC Midwest, to be unjust and unreasonable. In December 2015, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision on the Initial Complaint recommending to the FERC a reduction in the base rate of return on equity of the MISO Transmission owners from 12.38% to 10.32%, with a maximum rate of 11.35%. In September 2016, the FERC issued an order affirming the presiding administrative law judge's initial decision, with the new rates to become effective immediately and for the period from November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we provided net refunds related to the Initial Complaint, with interest, which were substantially finalized during the second quarter of 2017. All parties have filed motions for rehearing on various aspects of the September 2016 Order, the FERC\u2019s decision remains subject to change and the timing of further FERC action is uncertain.\nOn June 30, 2016, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision on the Second Complaint, which recommended a base rate of return on equity of 9.70%, which would be applicable for the period from February 12, 2015 through May 11, 2016 and going forward from the date on which the FERC issues an order on the Second Complaint, with a maximum rate of 10.68%. In resolving the Second Complaint, we expect the FERC to establish a new base rate and zone of reasonable returns that will be used, along with any incentive adders, to calculate the refund liability for the period from February 12, 2015 through May 11, 2016 and the rate going forward from the date on which the FERC issues an order. An April 2017 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in connection with the establishment of a new base ROE for TOs in ISO New England may affect the FERC decisions on the Initial Complaint and Second Complaint. In light of the April 2017 court decision, the MISO TOs filed a motion to dismiss the Second Complaint in September 2017. In 2016 and 2015, we adjusted revenues downward to accrue for the refund liability based on our estimate of the outcome of these complaints, which had a negative effect on our results of operations for those periods. The resolution of these matters may reduce our future revenues and net income and have a further adverse effect on our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe TCJA and any future changes in tax laws or regulations may negatively affect our results of operations, net income, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to taxation by various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels. In December 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the TCJA, which enacted significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after 2017. In addition, the TCJA provides modifications to bonus depreciation rules and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, both of which include carve-outs for regulated utilities.\nWhile certain aspects of the TCJA may be beneficial to ITC, overall we expect the enactment of the TCJA to adversely affect our results of operations, net income, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate as of the date of the enactment of the TCJA. The majority of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as a portion of its federal income tax net operating losses are held at our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. The majority of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at the Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are subject to a normalization method of accounting pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, the revaluation of the Regulated Operating Subsidiaries net deferred taxes generated a net regulatory liability of $512 million and a reduction in regulatory assets of $65 million at December 31, 2017 that would be returned to or received from customers over a period of time. The revaluation of the deferred tax assets and federal income tax net operating losses at ITC Holdings has resulted in additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $5 million.\nGiven the formula rates at our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, with a reduced corporate tax rate we will recover and collect lower cash taxes from our customers. Because we are in a federal income tax net operating loss position and not currently making cash tax payments, the result of this lower recovery is a reduction in cash flows from operations. Further, we may repost the 2018 projected rate templates for our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries to reflect the new effective tax rate. Additionally, we may be required to provide a refund for over-collections from customers from January 1, 2018 through the date of reposting.\nThe Company has debt at its Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and at ITC Holdings, and the TCJA provides limitations on the deductibility of interest. While interest deductibility for regulated utilities has been retained, there is still uncertainty as to whether the holding company debt of a regulated utility will be deductible. If the resolution of this issue results in limitations in the amount of interest expense that is deductible for ITC Holdings for income tax purposes, this would have an adverse effect on our net income.\nAs a result of the changes made to Code Section 162(m) by the TCJA, some of the compensation we provide to our executive officers may not be deductible in 2018 and going forward.\nWe cannot predict the timing or impacts of any future changes in tax laws, including the impacts of any subsequent technical corrections or clarifications. Additionally, certain aspects of the TCJA are still subject to interpretation. There may be further impacts that materially and adversely affect our results of operations, net income, financial condition, cash flows, and credit metrics beyond those described herein.\nOur actual capital investment may be lower than planned, which would cause a lower than anticipated rate base and would therefore result in lower revenues, earnings and associated cash flows compared to our current expectations. In addition, we expect to incur expenses related to the pursuit of development opportunities, which may be higher than forecasted.\nEach of our operating subsidiaries\u2019 rate base, revenues, earnings and associated cash flows are determined in part by additions to property, plant and equipment and when those additions are placed in service. We anticipate making significant capital investments over the next several years; however, the amounts could change significantly due to factors beyond our control. If our operating subsidiaries\u2019 capital investment and the resulting in-service property, plant and equipment are lower than anticipated for any reason, our operating subsidiaries will have a lower than anticipated rate base, thus causing their revenue requirements and future earnings and cash flows to be lower than anticipated.\nAny capital investment at our operating subsidiaries may be lower than our published estimates due to, among other factors, the impact of actual loads, forecasted loads, regional economic conditions, weather conditions, union strikes, labor shortages, material and equipment prices and availability, our ability to obtain financing for such expenditures, if necessary, limitations on the amount of construction that can be undertaken on our system or transmission systems owned by others at any one time, regulatory requirements relating to our rate construct, environmental issues, siting, regional planning, cost recovery or other issues, or as a result of legal proceedings and variances between estimated and actual costs of construction contracts awarded and the potential for greater competition. Our ability to engage in construction projects resulting from pursuing these initiatives is subject to significant uncertainties, including the factors discussed above, and will depend on obtaining any necessary regulatory and other approvals for the project and for us to initiate construction, our achieving status as the builder of the project in some circumstances and other factors. In addition, projects may be canceled, the scope of planned projects may change, or projects may not be completed on time, any of which may adversely affect our level of investment or cause our projected investments to be inaccurate. Therefore, we can provide no assurance as to the actual level of investment we may achieve at our operating subsidiaries.\nIn addition, we expect to incur expenses to pursue strategic development investment opportunities. If these payments or expenses are higher than anticipated, our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe regulations to which we are subject may limit our ability to raise capital and/or pursue acquisitions, development opportunities or other transactions or may subject us to liabilities.\nEach of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries is a \u201cpublic utility\u201d under the FPA and, accordingly, is subject to regulation by the FERC. Approval of the FERC is required under Section 203 of the FPA for a disposition or acquisition of regulated public utility facilities, either directly or indirectly through a holding company. Such approval is also required to acquire a significant interest in securities of a public utility. Section 203 of the FPA also provides\nthe FERC with explicit authority over utility holding companies\u2019 purchases or acquisitions of, and mergers or consolidations with, a public utility. Finally, each of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries must also seek approval by the FERC under Section 204 of the FPA for issuances of its securities (including debt securities).\nWe are also pursuing development projects for construction of transmission facilities and interconnections with generating resources. These projects may require regulatory approval by Federal agencies, including the FERC, applicable RTOs and state and local regulatory agencies. Failure to secure such regulatory approval for new strategic development projects could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and increase our revenues. If we fail to obtain these approvals when necessary, we may incur liabilities for such failure.\nChanges in energy laws, regulations or policies could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEach of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries is regulated by the FERC as a \u201cpublic utility\u201d under the FPA and is a transmission owner in MISO or SPP. We cannot predict whether the approved rate methodologies for any of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries will be changed. In addition, the U.S. Congress periodically considers enacting energy legislation that could assign new responsibilities to the FERC, modify provisions of the FPA or provide the FERC or another entity with increased authority to regulate transmission matters. We cannot predict whether, and to what extent, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries may be affected by any such changes in federal energy laws, regulations or policies in the future. While our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are subject to the FERC\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction for purposes of rate regulation, changes in state laws affecting other matters, such as transmission siting and construction, could limit investment opportunities available to us.\nEach of our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries depends on its primary customer for a substantial portion of its revenues, and any material failure by those primary customers to make payments for transmission services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nITCTransmission derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the transmission of electricity to DTE Electric\u2019s local distribution facilities. DTE Electric accounted for approximately 62.6% of ITCTransmission\u2019s total billed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 and is expected to constitute the majority of ITCTransmission\u2019s revenues for the foreseeable future. DTE Electric is rated BBB+/stable and A2/stable by Standard and Poor\u2019s Ratings Services and Moody\u2019s Investors Services, Inc., respectively. Similarly, Consumers Energy accounted for approximately 77.5% of METC\u2019s total billed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 and is expected to constitute the majority of METC\u2019s revenues for the foreseeable future. Consumers Energy is rated BBB+/stable and A2/stable by Standard and Poor\u2019s Ratings Services and Moody\u2019s Investors Services, Inc., respectively. Further, IP&L accounted for approximately 70.7% of ITC Midwest\u2019s total billed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 and is expected to constitute the majority of ITC Midwest\u2019s revenues for the foreseeable future. IP&L is rated A-/stable and Baa1/stable by Standard and Poor\u2019s Ratings Services and Moody\u2019s Investors Services, Inc., respectively. These percentages of total billed revenues of DTE Electric, Consumers Energy and IP&L include the collection of 2015 revenue accruals and deferrals and exclude any amounts for the 2017 revenue accruals and deferrals that were included in our 2017 operating revenues, but will not be billed to our customers until 2019.\nAny material failure by DTE Electric, Consumers Energy or IP&L to make payments for transmission services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant amount of the land on which our assets are located is subject to easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances. As a result, we must comply with the provisions of various easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances, which may adversely impact their ability to complete construction projects in a timely manner.\nMETC does not own the majority of the land on which its electric transmission assets are located. Instead, under the provisions of the Easement Agreement, METC pays an annual rent to Consumers Energy in exchange for rights-of-way, leases, fee interests and licenses which allow METC to use the land on which its transmission lines are located. Under the terms of the Easement Agreement, METC\u2019s easement rights could be eliminated if METC fails to meet certain requirements, such as paying contractual rent to Consumers Energy in a timely manner. Additionally, a significant amount of the land on which our other subsidiaries\u2019 assets are located is subject to easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances. As a result, they must comply with the provisions of various easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances, which may adversely impact their ability to complete their construction projects in a timely manner.\nWe contract with third parties to provide services for certain aspects of our business. If any of these agreements are terminated, we may face a shortage of labor or replacement contractors to provide the services formerly provided by these third parties.\nWe enter into various agreements and arrangements with third parties to provide services for construction, maintenance and operations of certain aspects of our business, which, if terminated, could result in a shortage of a readily available workforce to provide these services. If any of these agreements or arrangements is terminated for any reason, we may face difficulty finding a qualified replacement work force to provide such services, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to carry on our business and on our results of operations.\nHazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of our operations, costly litigation or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nOur operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks. The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations, litigation by aggrieved parties and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We maintain property and casualty insurance, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations and to laws that can give rise to substantial liabilities from environmental contamination.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the management, treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and hazardous materials, and impose obligations to investigate and remediate contamination in certain circumstances. Liabilities relating to investigation and remediation of contamination, as well as other liabilities concerning hazardous materials or contamination such as claims for personal injury or property damage, may arise at many locations, including formerly owned or operated properties and sites where wastes have been treated or disposed of, as well as properties we currently own or operate. Such liabilities may arise even where the contamination does not result from noncompliance with applicable environmental laws. Under a number of environmental laws, such liabilities may also be joint and several, meaning that a party can be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved, or even the entire share. Environmental requirements generally have become more stringent in recent years, and compliance with those requirements more expensive.\nWe have incurred expenses in connection with environmental compliance, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. Failure to comply with the extensive environmental laws and regulations applicable to us could result in significant civil or criminal penalties and remediation costs. Our assets and operations also involve the use of materials classified as hazardous, toxic or otherwise dangerous. Some of our facilities and properties are located near environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and habitats of endangered or threatened species. In addition, certain properties in which we operate are, or are suspected of being, affected by environmental contamination. Compliance with these laws and regulations, and liabilities concerning contamination or hazardous materials, may adversely affect our costs and, therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf amounts billed for transmission service for our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 transmission systems are lower than expected, or our actual revenue requirements are higher than expected, the timing of actual collection of our total revenues would be delayed.\nIf amounts billed for transmission service are lower than expected, which could result from lower network load or point-to-point transmission service on our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 transmission systems due to a weak economy, changes in the nature or composition of the transmission assets of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and surrounding areas, poor transmission quality of neighboring transmission systems, or for any other reason, the timing of actual collection of our total revenue requirement would likely be delayed until such circumstances are adjusted through the true-up mechanism in our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 formula rates. In addition, if the revenue requirements of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are higher than expected, due to higher actual expenditures compared to the forecasted expenditures used to develop their billing rates or for\nany other reason, the timing of actual collection of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries' total revenue requirements would likely be delayed until such circumstances are reflected through the true-up mechanism in our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries' expected formula rates. The effect of such under-collection would be to reduce the amount of our available cash resources from what we had expected, until such under-collection is corrected through the true-up mechanism in the formula rate template, which may require us to increase our outstanding indebtedness, thereby reducing our available borrowing capacity, and may require us to pay interest at a rate that exceeds the interest to which we are entitled in connection with the operation of the true-up mechanism.\nWe are subject to various regulatory requirements, including reliability standards; contract filing requirements; reporting, recordkeeping and accounting requirements; and transaction approval requirements. Violations of these requirements, whether intentional or unintentional, may result in penalties that, under some circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe various regulatory requirements to which we are subject include reliability standards established by the NERC, which acts as the nation\u2019s Electric Reliability Organization approved by the FERC in accordance with Section 215 of the FPA. These standards address operation, planning and security of the bulk power system, including requirements with respect to real-time transmission operations, emergency operations, vegetation management, critical infrastructure protection and personnel training. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in monetary penalties as well as non-monetary sanctions. Monetary penalties vary based on an assigned risk factor for each potential violation, the severity of the violation and various other circumstances, such as whether the violation was intentional or concealed, whether there are repeated violations, the degree of the violator\u2019s cooperation in investigating and remediating the violation and the presence of a compliance program, and such penalties can be substantial. Non-monetary sanctions include potential limitations on the violator\u2019s activities or operation and placing the violator on a watchlist for major violators. Despite our best efforts to comply and the implementation of a compliance program intended to ensure reliability, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur that would result in material penalties or sanctions. If any of our subsidiaries were to violate the NERC reliability standards, even unintentionally, in any material way, any penalties or sanctions imposed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are also subject to requirements under Sections 203 and 205 of the FPA for approval of transactions; reporting, recordkeeping and accounting requirements; and for filing contracts related to the provision of jurisdictional services. Under FERC policy, failure to file jurisdictional agreements on a timely basis may result in foregoing the time value of revenues collected under the agreement, but not to the point where a loss would be incurred. The failure to obtain timely approval of transactions subject to FPA Section 203, or to comply with applicable reporting, recordkeeping or accounting requirements under FPA Section 205, could subject us to penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nActs of war, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, natural disasters, severe weather and other catastrophic events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nActs of war, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, natural disasters, severe weather and other catastrophic events may negatively affect our business, financial condition and cash flows in unpredictable ways, such as increased security measures and disruptions of markets. Energy related assets, including, for example, our transmission facilities and DTE Electric\u2019s, Consumers Energy\u2019s and IP&L\u2019s generation and distribution facilities that we interconnect with, may be at risk of acts of war, terrorist attacks and cyber attacks, as well as natural disasters, severe weather and other catastrophic events. In addition to any physical damage caused by such events, cyber attacks targeting our information systems could impair our records, networks, systems and programs, or transmit viruses to other systems. Such events or the threat of such events may increase costs associated with heightened security requirements. In addition, such events or threats may have a material effect on the economy in general and could result in a decline in energy consumption, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Corporate and Financial Structure\nITC Holdings is a holding company with no operations, and unless we receive dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to fulfill our cash obligations.\nAs a holding company with no business operations, ITC Holdings\u2019 material assets consist primarily of the stock and membership interests in our subsidiaries. Our only sources of cash to meet our obligations are dividends and other payments received by us from time to time from our subsidiaries, the proceeds raised from the sale of our securities and borrowings under our various credit agreements. Each of our subsidiaries, however, is legally distinct from us and has no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us. The ability of each of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us is subject to, among other things, the availability of funds, after taking into account capital expenditure requirements, the terms of its indebtedness, applicable state laws and regulations of the FERC and the FPA. Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries target a FERC-approved capital structure of 60% equity and 40% debt that may limit the ability of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries to use net assets for the payment of dividends to ITC Holdings. In addition, ITC Holdings\u2019 right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors. If ITC Holdings does not receive cash or other assets from our subsidiaries, it may be unable to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness.\nWe have a considerable amount of debt and our reliance on debt financing may limit our ability to fulfill our debt obligations and/or to obtain additional financing.\nWe have a considerable amount of debt and our consolidated indebtedness includes various debt securities and borrowings, which utilize indentures, revolving and term loan credit agreements and commercial paper that we rely on as sources of capital and liquidity. Our capital structure can have several important consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nIf future cash flows are insufficient, we may not be able to make principal or interest payments on our debt obligations, which could result in the occurrence of an event of default under one or more of those debt instruments.\n\u2022\nWe may need to increase our indebtedness in order to make the capital expenditures and other expenses or investments planned by us.\n\u2022\nOur indebtedness has the general effect of reducing our flexibility to react to changing business and economic conditions insofar as they affect our financial condition. A substantial portion of the dividends and payments in lieu of taxes we receive from our subsidiaries will be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness, thereby, reducing our available cash.\n\u2022\nIn the event that we are liquidated, the creditors of our subsidiaries will be entitled to payment in full of the subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness prior to making any payments to ITC Holdings for the payment of its indebtedness.\n\u2022\nWe currently have debt instruments outstanding with short-term maturities or relatively short remaining maturities. Our ability to secure additional financing prior to or after these facilities mature, if needed, may be substantially restricted by the existing level of our indebtedness and the restrictions contained in our debt instruments. Additionally, the interest rates at which we might secure additional financings may be higher than our currently outstanding debt instruments or higher than forecasted at any point in time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nMarket conditions could affect our access to capital markets, restrict our ability to secure financing to make the capital expenditures and investments and pay other expenses planned by us which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the leverage-related risks described above.\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us.\nOur ability to access capital markets is important to our ability to operate our business. Increased scrutiny of the energy industry and the impact of the TCJA and other statutory or regulatory changes, as well as changes in our financial performance and unfavorable conditions in the capital markets could result in credit agencies\nreexamining and downgrading our credit ratings. In addition, because we are now a subsidiary of Fortis, a downgrade in Fortis\u2019 credit rating could cause our credit rating to be downgraded as well, even if our creditworthiness has not otherwise deteriorated. A downgrade in our credit ratings could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs. A rating downgrade could also increase the interest we pay on commercial paper and under our revolving and term loan credit agreements.\nCertain provisions in our debt instruments limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nOur debt instruments on a consolidated basis, including senior notes, secured notes, first mortgage bonds, revolving and term loan credit agreements and commercial paper, contain numerous financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengage in sale and lease-back transactions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens or other encumbrances;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ncreate and acquire subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on our stock or on the stock or member capital of our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the covenants require us to meet certain financial ratios, such as maintaining certain net debt to capitalization ratios and certain funds from operations to net debt levels. Our ability to comply with these and other requirements and restrictions may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions, results of operations or other events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the obligations contained in any of our debt instruments could result in acceleration of related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.", "PERMNO": 90786, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "ITC1"}
