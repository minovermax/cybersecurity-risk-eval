{"cik": "901491", "company": "PAPA JOHNS INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks could cause actual operating results to differ from those expressed in certain \u201cforward looking statements\u201d contained in this Form 10-K as well as in other Company communications. Before you invest in our securities you should carefully consider these risk factors together with all other information included in this Form 10-K and our other publicly filed documents.\nOur profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our industry.\nThe QSR Pizza industry is mature and highly competitive. Competition is based on price, service, location, food quality, brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, use of technology, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. From time to time, we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures, which may adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, when commodity and other costs increase, we may be limited in our ability to increase prices. With the significant levels of competition we may be required to increase investment spending in several areas including marketing and technology, which can decrease profitability.\nIn addition to competition with our larger and more established competitors who have substantially greater financial and other resources then we do, we also face competition from new competitors and concepts such as fast casual pizza concepts. We also face additional competitive pressures from food delivery concepts using new delivery technologies, some of which may have more effective marketing. The emergence or growth of new competitors may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our market share and could negatively impact our sales and our system-wide restaurant operations.\nOne of our competitive strengths is our Better Ingredients, Better Pizza brand promise. This means that we may use ingredients which cost more than the ingredients some of our competitors may use. Because of our investment in higher quality ingredients, we could have lower profit margins than some of our competitors if we are not able to maintain premium pricing for our products.\nChanges in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could adversely impact our results.\nChanges in consumer preferences and trends (for example, changes in dietary preferences that could cause consumers to avoid pizza or some of its ingredients in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthful, lower-calorie or otherwise based on their ingredients or nutritional content) or preferences for a dining experience such as fast casual pizza concepts, could adversely affect our restaurant business. Also, our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer income and spending, such as general economic conditions and the level of employment. Any factors that could cause consumers to spend less on food or shift to lower-priced products could reduce sales or inhibit our ability to maintain or increase pricing, either of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nFood safety and quality concerns may negatively impact our business and profitability.\nIncidents or reports of food- or water-borne illness or other food safety issues, investigations or other actions by food safety regulators, food contamination or tampering, employee hygiene and cleanliness failures, improper franchisee or employee conduct, or presence of communicable disease at our Company-owned and franchised restaurants, QC Centers, or suppliers could lead to product liability or other claims. If we were to experience any such incidents or reports, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted. This could result in a significant decrease in customer traffic and could negatively impact our revenues and profits. Similar incidents or reports occurring at quick service restaurants unrelated to us could likewise create negative publicity, which could negatively impact consumer behavior towards us.\nWe rely on our domestic and international suppliers, as do our franchisees, to provide quality ingredients and to comply with applicable laws and industry standards. A failure of one of our domestic or international suppliers to meet our quality standards, or meet domestic or international food industry standards, could result in a disruption in our supply chain and negatively impact our brand and our business and profitability.\nOur results depend upon our ability to differentiate our brand and our reputation for quality. Damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact our business and financial results. Our brand has been highly rated in U.S. surveys, and we strive to build the value of our brand as we develop international markets. The value of our brand and demand for our products could be damaged by any incidents that harm consumer perceptions of the Company and our brand. As a result of the impact of social media, the value of our brand and the demand for our products could be quickly and seriously damaged due to the widespread publicity that can be associated with one or more of these incidents.\nWe may not be able to effectively market our products or maintain key marketing partnerships.\nThe success of our system-wide business depends on the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional plans. We may not be able to effectively execute our national or local marketing plans, particularly if lower sales result in reduced levels of funds from PJMF. Our marketing strategy utilizes relationships with well-known sporting events, athletes, celebrity personalities and our brand spokesman to market our products. Our business could suffer if we are not able to maintain key marketing relationships and sponsorships, or if we are unable to do so at a reasonable cost, and could require additional investments in\nalternative marketing strategies. Actions taken by persons endorsing our products that harm their reputations could also cause harm to our brand.\nChanges in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email, text messages and postal mailings. Any future restrictions in federal, state or foreign laws regarding marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email, text messages and postal mailing techniques and could force changes in our marketing strategies. If this occurs, we may need to develop alternative marketing strategies, which could impact the amount and timing of our revenues.\nWe may not be able to execute our strategy or achieve our planned growth targets, which could negatively impact our business and our financial results.\nOur growth strategy depends on our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to open new restaurants and to operate them on a profitable basis. We expect substantially all of our international unit growth and much of our domestic unit growth to be franchised units. Accordingly, our profitability increasingly depends upon royalty revenues from franchisees. If our franchisees are not able to operate their businesses successfully under our franchised business model, our results could suffer. Additionally, we may fail to attract new qualified franchisees or existing franchisees may close underperforming locations. Planned growth targets and the ability to operate new and existing restaurants profitably are affected by economic, regulatory and competitive conditions and consumer buying habits. Increased commodity or operating costs, including, but not limited to, employee compensation and benefits or insurance costs, could slow the rate of new store openings or increase the number of store closings. Our business is susceptible to adverse changes in local, national and global economic conditions, which could make it difficult for us to meet our growth targets. Additionally, we or our franchisees may face challenges securing financing, finding suitable store locations at acceptable terms or securing required domestic or foreign government permits and approvals.\nOur franchisees remain dependent on the availability of financing to remodel or renovate existing locations, upgrade systems and enhance technology, or construct and open new restaurants. From time to time, the Company may provide financing to certain franchisees and prospective franchisees in order to mitigate store closings, allow new units to open, or complete required upgrades. If we are unable or unwilling to provide such financing, which is a function of, among other things, a franchisee\u2019s credit worthiness, the number of new restaurant openings may be slower than expected and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. To the extent we provide financing to franchisees in domestic and international markets, our results could be negatively impacted by negative performance of these franchisee loans.\nIf we do not meet our growth targets or the expectations of the market for net restaurant openings or our other strategic objectives, our stock price could decline.\nWe may be adversely impacted by increases in the cost of food ingredients and other costs.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in commodities. An increase in the cost, or sustained high levels of the cost of cheese or other commodities could adversely affect the profitability of our system-wide restaurant operations, particularly if we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to offset increased costs. Cheese, representing our largest food cost, and other commodities can be subject to significant cost fluctuations due to weather, availability, global demand and other factors that are beyond our control. Additionally, increases in labor, mileage, insurance, and other costs, could adversely affect the profitability of our restaurant and QC Center businesses. Most of the factors affecting costs in our system-wide restaurant\noperations are beyond our control, and we may not be able to adequately mitigate these costs or pass along these costs to our customers or franchisees, given the significant competitive pricing pressure.\nOur dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers for some ingredients could result in disruptions to our business.\nDomestic restaurants purchase substantially all food and related products from our QC Centers. We are dependent on Leprino Foods Dairy Products Company (\u201cLeprino\u201d) as our sole supplier for cheese, one of our key ingredients. Leprino, one of the major pizza category suppliers of cheese in the United States, currently supplies all of our cheese domestically and substantially all of our cheese internationally. While we have no other sole sources of supply for key ingredients, we do source other key ingredients from a limited number of suppliers. Alternative sources of supply of cheese or other key ingredients may not be available on a timely basis or may not be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current arrangements.\nOur corporate and franchised restaurants could also be harmed by a prolonged disruption in the supply of products from or to our QC Centers due to weather, climate change, natural disasters, crop disease, labor dispute or interruption of service by carriers. In particular, adverse weather or crop disease affecting the California tomato crop could disrupt the supply of pizza sauce to our and our franchisees\u2019 restaurants. Insolvency of key suppliers could also cause similar business interruptions and negatively impact our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may disrupt our operations or supply chain.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster, epidemic, cyber attack or other catastrophic event may result in the closure of Company-owned or franchised restaurants, our corporate office, any of our QC Centers or the facilities of our suppliers, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in purchasing practices by our domestic franchisees could harm our commissary business.\nAlthough our domestic franchisees currently purchase substantially all food products from our QC Centers, they are only required to purchase from our QC Centers tomato sauce, dough and other items we may designate as proprietary or integral to our system. Any changes in purchasing practices by domestic franchisees, which have become more sensitive to charges and other fees, such as seeking alternative approved suppliers of ingredients or other food products, could adversely affect the financial results of our QC Centers and the Company.\nOur current insurance may not be adequate and we may experience claims in excess of our reserves.\nOur insurance programs for workers\u2019 compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles, general liability, property and team member health insurance coverage are funded by the Company up to certain retention levels, generally ranging from $100,000 to $500,000. These insurance programs or our program for cyber insurance may not be adequate to protect us, and it may be difficult or impossible to obtain additional coverage or maintain current coverage at a reasonable cost. We also have experienced increasing claims volatility and higher related costs for workers\u2019 compensation, owned and non-owned automobiles and health claims. We estimate loss reserves based on historical trends, actuarial assumptions and other data available to us, but we may not be able to accurately estimate reserves. If we experience claims in excess of our projections, our business could be negatively impacted, and our franchisees could be similarly impacted by higher claims experience.\nOur international operations are subject to increased risks and other factors that may make it more difficult to achieve or maintain profitability or meet planned growth rates.\nOur international operations could be negatively impacted by changes in international economic, political, security or health conditions in the countries in which the Company or our franchisees operate, especially in emerging markets. In addition, there are risks associated with differing business and social cultures and consumer preferences. We may also face limited availability for restaurant locations, higher location costs and difficulties in franchisee selection and financing. We may be subject to difficulties in sourcing and importing high-quality ingredients (and ensuring food safety) in a cost-effective manner, hiring and retaining qualified team members, marketing effectively and adequately investing in information technology, especially in emerging markets.\nOur international operations are also subject to additional risk factors, including import and export controls, compliance with anti-corruption and other foreign laws, changes in tax laws, difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contract rights in foreign jurisdictions, and the imposition of increased or new tariffs or trade barriers. We intend to continue to expand internationally, which would make the risks related to our international operations more significant over time.\nOur international results, which are substantially franchised, depend heavily on the operating capabilities and financial strength of our franchisees. Any changes in the ability of our franchisees to run their stores profitably in accordance with our operating procedures, or to effectively sub franchise stores, could result in brand damage, a higher number of restaurant closures and a reduction in the number of new restaurant openings. Our Company-owned store presence is currently limited to our stores in China, which are classified as held for sale. We may find it difficult to find a suitable buyer for our Company-owned stores in China in a timely fashion, or a new franchisee could develop the market more slowly than we anticipate, which could delay our growth in this market.\nForeign currency or interest rate risks could adversely affect our financial results.\nSales made by our franchisees in international markets are denominated in their local currencies, and fluctuations in the U.S. dollar occur relative to the local currencies. Accordingly, changes in currency exchange rates will cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate. We have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Our international revenues and earnings may be adversely impacted as the U.S. dollar rises against foreign currencies, because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars, which occurred in 2015. Additionally, the value of certain assets or loans denominated in local currencies may deteriorate. Other items denominated in U.S dollars including product imports or loans may also become more expensive, putting pressure on franchisees\u2019 cash flows.\nUnder our revolving credit facility, we are exposed to variable interest rates. A significant increase in interest rates or total borrowings could adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, rising interest rates could impact our franchisees and their ability to open new restaurants or operate existing restaurants profitably.\nIncreasingly complex laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in an increasingly complex regulatory environment, and the cost of regulatory compliance is increasing. Our failure, or the failure of any of our franchisees, to comply with applicable U.S. and international labor, health care, food, health and safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery and corruption, competition, environmental and other laws, may result in civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties. Enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements, and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation and enforcement actions involving food matters and product marketing claims, may increase compliance and legal costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business. For example, some\nlocal government agencies have implemented ordinances that restrict the sale of certain food or drink products.\nCompliance with new or additional government laws or regulations, including menu labeling requirements, could increase costs and be harmful to system-wide restaurant sales. Non-compliance with laws or government regulations could result in enforcement actions or investigations and could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and our reputation.\nIn addition, a change in our tax rates, or new tax legislation impacting our business or the restaurant industry could negatively impact our results.\nChanges in employment and labor laws, including health care legislation and minimum wage increases, could increase costs for our system-wide operations.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime compensation, benefits, working conditions, citizenship requirements and discrimination and family and medical leave. Labor costs and labor-related benefits are primary components in the cost of operation of our domestic system-wide restaurants and QC Centers. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could increase our system-wide labor costs.\nA significant number of hourly personnel are paid at rates closely related to the federal and state minimum wage requirements. Accordingly, the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases above federal wage rates or proposed Department of Labor regulations related to exempt employees could increase labor costs for our domestic system-wide operations. Additionally, social media may be used to foster negative perceptions of employment in our industry and promote strikes or boycotts.\nThe Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees in the United States or pay penalties for not providing coverage. We, like other industry competitors, are complying with the law and are providing more extensive health benefits to employees than we had previously provided, and are subsidizing a larger portion of their insurance premiums. These additional costs could negatively impact our operational results. In addition, our franchisees subject to the ACA could face additional cost pressures from compliance with the legislation, which could reduce their future expansion of units.\nFailure to retain the services of our Founder, John Schnatter, as Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and brand spokesman, or to successfully execute succession planning, could harm our Company and brand.\nJohn H. Schnatter, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, does not serve under an employment agreement, and we do not maintain key man life insurance on Mr. Schnatter. We also depend on the continued availability of Mr. Schnatter\u2019s image and his services as spokesman in our advertising and promotion materials. While we have entered into a license agreement with Mr. Schnatter related to the use of certain intellectual property related to his name, likeness and image, our business and brand may be harmed if Mr. Schnatter\u2019s services were not available to the Company for any reason or the reputation of Mr. Schnatter were negatively impacted. In addition, failure to effectively execute succession planning with respect to Mr. Schnatter and other senior leaders could harm our Company and brand.\nThe concentration of stock ownership with Mr. Schnatter may influence the outcome of certain matters requiring stockholder approval.\nThe concentration of stock ownership by our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer allows him to substantially influence the outcome of certain matters requiring stockholder approval. As of December 27, 2015, he beneficially\nowned approximately 27% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, he may be able to substantially influence the strategic direction of the Company and the outcome of matters requiring approval by our stockholders.\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to invest in or adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including digital ordering solutions, through which approximately half of our domestic sales originate. We also rely heavily on point-of-sale processing in our Company-owned and franchised restaurants for data collection and payment systems for the collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions, and other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends on the reliability and capacity of these technology systems. In addition, we anticipate that consumers will continue to have more options to place orders digitally, both domestically and internationally. Our failure to adequately invest in new technology, adapt to technological developments and industry trends, particularly our digital ordering capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share. Additionally, we are in an environment where the technology life cycle is short which requires continued reinvestments in technology and increases the risk that our technology may not be customer centric or could become obsolete, inefficient or otherwise incompatible with other systems.\nWe rely heavily on our international franchisees to maintain their own point-of-sale and on line ordering systems, which are often purchased from third party vendors.\nDisruptions of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to compete and conduct our business.\nOur critical business and information technology systems could be damaged or interrupted by power loss, various technological failures, user errors, sabotage or acts of God. In particular, we may experience occasional interruptions of our digital ordering solutions, which make online ordering unavailable or slow to respond, negatively impacting sales and the experience of our customers. If our digital ordering solutions do not perform with adequate speed, our customers may be less inclined to return to our digital ordering solutions.\nPart of our technology infrastructure, such as our FOCUS point-of-sale system, is specifically designed for us and our operational systems, which could cause unexpected costs, delays or inefficiencies when infrastructure upgrades are needed or prolonged and widespread technological difficulties occur. Significant portions of our technology infrastructure are provided by third parties, and the performance of these systems is largely beyond our control. Failure of our third-party systems, and backup systems, to adequately perform, particularly as our online sales grow, could harm our business and the satisfaction of our customers. In addition, we may not have or be able to obtain adequate protection or insurance to mitigate the risks of these events or compensate for losses related to these events, which could damage our business and reputation and be expensive and difficult to remedy or repair.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in damages to our reputation, loss of sales, and/or subject us to litigation, penalties or significant costs.\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card data and other personally identifiable information of our employees and customers housed in the various information systems we use. Constantly changing cyber security threats pose risks to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality of our data. As techniques used in cyber attacks evolve, we may not be able to timely detect threats or anticipate and implement security measures. The integrity and\nprotection of that customer, employee, franchisee and Company data are critical to us. The failure to prevent fraud or security breaches or to adequately invest in data security could harm our business and revenues due to the reputational damage to our brand. Such a breach could also result in litigation, regulatory actions, penalties, and other significant costs to us and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. These costs could be well in excess of our cyber insurance coverage.\nWe have been and will continue to be subject to various types of investigations and litigation, including collective and class action litigation, which could subject us to significant damages or other remedies.\nWe are subject to the risk of investigations and litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, franchisees, state and federal agencies, stockholders and employees. From time to time, we are involved in a number of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings consisting of intellectual property, employment, consumer, personal injury, commercial and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We have been subject to claims in cases containing collective and class action allegations. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. Litigation trends involving the relationship between franchisors and franchisees, personal injury claims, employment law and intellectual property may increase our cost of doing business. We evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the amount of potential losses to us. In many cases, particularly collective and class action cases, we may not be able to estimate the amount of potential losses and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient. These assessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of judgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact earnings. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on the Papa John\u2019s brand name and rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property rights to protect and promote our brand. We believe the success of our business depends on our continued ability to exclusively use our existing marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand, both domestically and abroad. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and we may be required to pursue litigation to prevent consumer confusion and preserve our brand\u2019s high-quality reputation. Litigation could result in high costs and diversion of resources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, regardless of the outcome.\nWe may be subject to impairment charges.\nImpairment charges are possible due to the nature and timing of decisions we make about underperforming assets or markets, or if previously opened or acquired restaurants perform below our expectations. This could result in a decrease in our reported asset value and reduction in our net income.", "PERMNO": 79299, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "PZZA"}
