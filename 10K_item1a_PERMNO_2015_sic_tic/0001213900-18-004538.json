Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY AND TECHNOLOGIES BUSINESS\nTHE MOBILE APPLICATION INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON THE FREQUENT ENHANCEMENT OF EXISTING PRODUCTS AND TIMELY INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS THAT MEET OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 NEEDS.\nCustomer requirements for mobile application products are rapidly evolving and technological changes in our industry occur rapidly. To keep up with new customer requirements and distinguish us from our competitors, we must frequently introduce new products and enhancements of existing products. Enhancing existing products and developing new products is a complex and uncertain process. It often requires significant investments in research and development (R&D). Furthermore, we may not be able to launch new or improved products before our competition launches comparable products. Any of these factors could cause our business or financial results to suffer.\nWE ARE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON WIRELESS SERVICE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS (CYBER SECURITY).\nAs a provider of a mobile application, we rely upon technology systems and infrastructure. In particular, we are heavily dependent and reliant on availability of technology from Apple (iOS phones) and Google (Android phones and geo locating services). Our operations are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access and other events such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. There can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition of the Company. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise if we consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities.\nOur systems are an integral part of our customers\u2019 business operations. It is critical for our customers, that our systems provide a continued and uninterrupted performance. Customers may be dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide services to them. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our services significantly and could result in decreased demand for our services.\nTHE U.S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS EVOLVING, AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE FAIL TO ADAPT.\nThe U.S. healthcare system is evolving, in part in response to the passage of the ACA in 2010. The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The ACA provided for extensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage, fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates, creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage. The ACA also permits the establishment of ACOs.\nPresident Donald Trump has announced that he favors repealing the ACA. In 2017, the federal legislature undertook efforts to repeal, revise or replace the ACA, and the individual mandate adopted as part of the ACA was repealed. In more recent legislation, some additional aspects of the ACA were modified: another two-year moratorium was implemented on the device tax imposed on the sellers of certain medical devices in the U.S., including those purchased and used by laboratories; the tax on health insurers was delayed for a year; and the \"Cadillac tax\" on certain employee benefit plans was also delayed for two years. As part of legislation enacted in early 2018, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which under the ACA was to be responsible annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing Medicare cost growth while preserving quality, was repealed. The scope and timing of any further legislation to repeal, amend, replace, or reform the rest of the ACA is uncertain, but if such legislation were to become law, it could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare system. In addition, uncertainty regarding the ACA prior to any such repeal, amendment, replacement or reform could create uncertainty generally in the healthcare market.\nSignificant change is taking place in the healthcare system. For example, ACOs, IDNs and patient-centered medical homes have grown as a means to deliver patient care. Value-based reimbursement is increasing; CMS has set goals for value-based reimbursement to be achieved. Patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for, and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for, their healthcare. Healthcare industry participants are consolidating. Healthcare services increasingly are being provided by non-traditional providers (e.g., physician assistants), in non-traditional venues (e.g., retail medical clinics, urgent care centers) and using new technologies (e.g., telemedicine). Utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors, and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services. We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue, and such change could be extensive.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING OUR ACTIVITIES, AND WE MAY FACE SUBSTANTIAL FINES AND PENALTIES, AND OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MAY BE IMPACTED, IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY.\nOur business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (including at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business. While we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws, many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, including many of those relating to:\n\u25cf billing and reimbursement of clinical testing;\n\u25cf certification or licensure of clinical laboratories;\n\u25cf the anti-self-referral and anti-kickback laws and regulations;\n\u25cf the laws and regulations administered by the FDA;\n\u25cf the corporate practice of medicine;\n\u25cf operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical testing services are accurate, reliable and timely;\n\u25cf physician fee splitting;\n\u25cf relationships with physicians and hospitals;\n\u25cf safety and health of laboratory employees; and\n\u25cf handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials.\nThese laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices. We may not be able to maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or if we fail to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected.\nThe federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud. Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse. In addition, the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, these types of investigations and related litigation can result in:\n\u25cf diversion of management time and attention;\n\u25cf expenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, costs and payment of damages;\n\u25cf limitations on our ability to continue some of our operations;\n\u25cf enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages;\n\u25cf decreased demand for our services; and/or\n\u25cf injury to our reputation.\nAlthough we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion. Moreover, even when an investigation is resolved favorably, the process may be time-consuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive.\nChanges in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted, or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs, delay, modification, withdrawal or reconsideration. Such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives.\nOUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE FDA'S APPROACH TO REGULATION.\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, software, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the U.S. A number of tests we develop internally are offered as laboratory developed tests (LDTs). The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories.\nPursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA has issued guidance regarding the regulation of clinical decision support software, which may be used in, or in connection with, LDTs. The guidance has created uncertainty regarding whether FDA approval of certain tests is required.\nIn 2017, the FDA published a \"Discussion Document\" providing its views on legislative alternatives to regulate LDTs. New legislation could significantly impact the clinical laboratory testing business, including by increasing or modifying the regulation of LDTs, hindering our ability to develop and market new services, causing an increase in the cost of our services, delaying our ability to introduce new tests or hindering our ability to perform testing.\nTHE CLINICAL TESTING BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND IF WE FAIL TO PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATELY PRICED LEVEL OF SERVICE OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.\nThe clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry. We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: (i) other commercial clinical laboratories, (ii) hospital-affiliated laboratories and (iii) physician-office laboratories. We also compete with other providers, including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices. Hospitals generally maintain on-site laboratories to perform testing on their patients (inpatient or outpatient). In addition, many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing. Hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital's laboratory. As a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing. In addition, hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospital's laboratory. In recent years, there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices, increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals. Increased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and thus strengthen their competitive position. The formation of ACOs and IDNs, and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers, in addition to the impact of informatics, also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services.\nThe diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) advanced testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.\nGOVERNMENT PAYERS, SUCH AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO REDUCE THE UTILIZATION AND REIMBURSEMENT OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES, INCLUDING CLINICAL TESTING SERVICES.\nWe face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services. We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue.\nFrom time to time, Congress has legislated reductions in, or frozen updates to, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. In addition, CMS has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform. We also provide physician services that are reimbursed by Medicare under a physician fee schedule, which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis. In recent years, reductions in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for anatomic pathology services adversely impacted our business relative to the business of some of our competitors whose anatomic pathology business was not as sizable as ours. Medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures. The ACA includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels.\nIn addition, over the last several years, the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries, called \u201cMedicare Advantage\u201d programs, and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs. There has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering Medicare Advantage programs, and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs. Also, states have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements. Recently, state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business, such as delaying payments, reducing reimbursement, restricting coverage eligibility, denying claims and service coverage restrictions.\nFrom time to time, the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for Medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care. Congress periodically considers cost-saving initiatives. These initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical testing services, co-payments for clinical testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions.\nPAMA is impacting the diagnostic information services industry. Pursuant to this legislation, CMS has revised the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for 2018, 2019 and 2020. Under the revised Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is scheduled to be reduced in 2018, 2019 and 2020. PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; further reduction in reimbursement may result from such revisions.\nHEALTH PLANS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO REDUCE THE UTILIZATION AND REIMBURSEMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES, INCLUDING CLINICAL TESTING SERVICES.\nWe face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, including health plans, to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services. For example, since the passage of ACA, there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models. We expect continuing efforts by third-party payers, including in their rules, practices and policies, to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services. ACOs and IDNs also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of, or reimbursement for, diagnostic information services.\nThe healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers, including clinical testing providers. These health plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements. In addition, some health plans have been willing to limit the PPO or POS laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved fee-for-service pricing; we may cease to be a contracted provider to a health plan. Some health plans also are reviewing test coding, evaluating coverage decisions and requiring preauthorization of certain testing. There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing.\nThe increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer. The ACA included provisions, including regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges, that may encourage health insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting.\nGOVERNMENT PAYERS AND THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING HEALTH PLANS, MAY NOT RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF, OR COMPENSATE OR REIMBURSE US FOR, NEW AND INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS.\nGovernment payers and third parties, including health plans, are taking steps to reduce utilization of, and reimbursement for, some new and innovative healthcare solutions, including new tests and other solutions that we may offer.\nIn 2017, CMS issued a draft national coverage policy for next-generation sequencing cancer panels. The draft policy, were it finalized without change, would effect a de facto requirement that each laboratory test using next generation sequencing technology that would need to be approved or cleared by the FDA before being covered by Medicare. Third parties, including health plans, have not announced any change in approach to coverage for next-generation sequencing cancer panels.\nThe American Medical Association CPT\u00ae Editorial Panel is continuing its process of establishing new billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing and toxicology testing. The adoption of these codes on certain occasions has led, and could continue to lead, to limited coverage decisions, payment denials or new procedures or conditions for payment. Payment levels for many new codes remain largely unresolved and healthcare providers continue to address implementation of the new codes.\nThese steps may discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer.\nFAILURE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT RECEIPT AND USE OF CONFIDENTIAL HEALTH INFORMATION CONCERNING INDIVIDUALS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES, FINES OR PENALTIES AND POTENTIAL REPUTATIONAL HARM.\nMany aspects of our business involve the collection, transmission and use of an individual\u2019s protected health information or other sensitive personal information. In some cases, we also use aggregated and de-identified data as defined by HIPAA for analytical and research purposes, particularly data related to improving the quality of the care we provide. In other cases, we may provide de-identified data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and to third-party data aggregators where permitted by our contracts. These activities are subject to federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations and, in the future, may be subject to international regulatory requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation, a new European Union privacy regulation that takes effect on May 25, 2018. At the federal level, HIPAA imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by all participants in the health care industry, whether directly as a covered entity or as a business associate. Our business encompasses both situations and includes our pharmacists, nurse practitioners and PBM operations. In addition, industry requirements, such as Generally Accepted Privacy Principles may be imposed on us by our contracts with our PBM clients or other customers. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a security standard mandated by the credit card industry for the purpose of protecting credit card account data. These increasingly complex laws, regulations and industry requirements are subject to change and compliance with them may result in significant expenses associated with increased operational and compliance costs, particularly as we continue to collect and retain large amounts of information. To the extent that either we or our vendors with whom we share information are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, we could be subject to additional litigation, regulatory risks and reputational harm. For example, the privacy and security of the information we maintain may be compromised by the actions of outside parties, by employee errors or by malfeasance. Such risks may result in an unauthorized party obtaining access to our data systems thereby threatening the privacy of protected health information or other sensitive personal information we use and maintain. Failure to comply with federal or state statutes or regulations may result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In addition, failure to comply with our own privacy or security policies may result in sanctions by the FTC or other federal oversight agencies. Future regulations and legislation that severely restrict or prohibit our use of patient, member or customer identifiable or other information could limit our ability to use information critical to the operation of our business. Furthermore, if we violate a patient\u2019s privacy or are found to have violated any federal or state statute or regulation with regard to confidentiality or dissemination or use of PHI, we could be liable for significant damages, fines or penalties and suffer reputational harm, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR EFFICIENCY.\nIt is important that we continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including diagnostic information services.\nBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND INTEGRATING OUR OPERATIONS WITH BUSINESSES WE ACQUIRE MAY BE DIFFICULT.\nWe may plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities, such as acquisitions, licensing, investments and alliances. However, these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities. Moreover, the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity, and to integrate it into our business. The success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities, but also on the property, resources, efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners. Further, disputes may arise with strategic partners, due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests.\nEach potential acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that has different systems, processes, policies and cultures. Integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired, difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies, the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies, challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses, and potential adverse effects on operating results. The process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses as a result of the following difficulties, among others:\n\u25cf loss of key customers or employees;\n\u25cf difficulty in standardizing information and other systems;\n\u25cf difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure;\n\u25cf failure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that our Company has historically provided;\n\u25cf diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of our Company as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties; and\n\u25cf the added costs of dealing with such disruptions.\nIf we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. Even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration, either in monetary terms or in a timely manner.\nFAILURE TO ACCURATELY BILL FOR OUR SERVICES, OR TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS RELATING TO GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.\nBilling for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, clinicians, hospitals and employer groups. The majority of billing and related operations for our Company are being provided by a third party under the Company's oversight. Failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences, including: (1) exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business.\nFAILURE IN OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING FAILURES RESULTING FROM OUR SYSTEMS CONVERSIONS, COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND CAUSE THE LOSS OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.\nIT systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, system conversion or standardization initiatives, human acts and natural disasters.\nOUR IT SYSTEMS MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNAUTHORIZED TAMPERING, CYBER ATTACK OR OTHER SECURITY BREACH.\nUnauthorized persons may seek to obtain intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our IT systems. We have taken, and continue to take, precautionary measures to reduce the risk of, better detect and respond to future cyber threats, and prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our IT systems, including the loss or theft of intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our systems. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, compromise intellectual property or confidential information or otherwise adversely impact our business. There can be no assurances that our precautionary measures will prevent or successfully defend against cyber threats that could have a significant impact on our business.\nFAILURE TO DEVELOP, OR ACQUIRE LICENSES FOR, NEW TESTS, TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR TESTING VOLUME AND REVENUES.\nThe diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs. In addition, they could introduce new tests, technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services. Our success in continuing to introduce new solutions, technology and services will depend, in part, on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms. We may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services. We also may be unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements, and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests. If we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, our research and development costs may increase as a result. In addition, if we are unable to develop and introduce, or license, new solutions, technology and services to expand our advanced testing capabilities, our services may become outdated when compared with our competition.\nAny of these events could have a significant impact on our business.\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW, MORE COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE PERFORMED BY OUR CUSTOMERS OR BY PATIENTS, AND THE CONTINUED INTERNALIZATION OF TESTING BY HOSPITALS OR PHYSICIANS, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR TESTING VOLUME AND REVENUES.\nThe diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by clinicians in their offices; (2) complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers. Advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing. Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be \u201cwaived\u201d tests under CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits.\nSome traditional customers for anatomic pathology services, including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures, such as dermatologists, gastroenterologists, urologists and oncologists, have added in-office histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site. Hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing, including some non-routine and advanced testing. Internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers, such as the Company.\nOUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PERFORMANCE.\nOur people are a critical resource. The supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong. We may lose, or fail to attract and retain, key management personnel, or qualified skilled technical or professional employees.\nFAILURE TO ESTABLISH, AND PERFORM TO, APPROPRIATE QUALITY STANDARDS TO ASSURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD OF QUALITY IS OBSERVED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION.\nThe provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks. The services that we provide are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care. Therefore, users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes.\nNegligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events. We may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists, laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospital-based pathologists. We are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation.\nOUR OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION MAY BE IMPAIRED IF WE DO NOT COMPLY WITH PRIVACY LAWS OR INFORMATION SECURITY POLICIES.\nIn our business, we generate or maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information. If we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be impaired, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation. We may be subject to litigation and governmental investigation, and may suffer reputational damage, as a result of a data breach, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOUR REVENUES WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON ACCEPTANCE OF OUR SERVICES BY THE MARKET. THE FAILURE OF SUCH ACCEPTANCE WILL CAUSE US TO CURTAIL OR CEASE OPERATIONS.\nOur revenues are expected to come from our services. As a result, we will continue to incur operating losses until such time as revenues reach a mature level and we are able to generate sufficient revenues from our services to meet our operating expenses. There can be no assurance that patients will adopt our services. In the event that we are not able to market and significantly increase the number of patients that utilize our services, or if we are unable to charge the necessary prices, our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nWE MIGHT INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE TO FURTHER DEVELOP OUR SERVICES WHICH MAY NEVER BECOME SUFFICIENTLY SUCCESSFUL.\nOur growth strategy requires the successful launch of our services. Although management will take every precaution to ensure that our services will, with a high degree of likelihood, achieve commercial success, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. The causes for failure of our services once commercialized can be numerous, including:\n\u25cf market demand for our services proves to be smaller than we expect;\n\u25cf Compliance with changing regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nLIABILITY ISSUES ARE INHERENT IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY AND INSURANCE IS EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN; WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO LARGE LAWSUITS.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks, which are inherent in the healthcare industry. While we will take precautions we deem to be appropriate to avoid liability suits against us, there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid significant liability exposure. Liability insurance for the healthcare industry is generally expensive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain, and then maintain, such coverage on acceptable terms, or that any insurance policy will provide adequate protection against potential claims. A successful liability claim brought against us may exceed any insurance coverage secured by us and could have a material adverse effect on our results or ability to continue our platform.\nWE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY.\nWe may encounter competition from local, regional or national entities, some of which have superior resources or other competitive advantages in the larger physical therapy space. Intense competition may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. These competitors may be larger and more highly capitalized, with greater name recognition. We will compete with such companies on brand name, quality of services, level of expertise, advertising, product and service innovation and differentiation of product and services. As a result, our ability to secure significant market share may be impeded. Although we believe our services will enable us to service more patients than traditional providers, if these more established offices or providers start offering similar services to ours, their name recognition or experience may enable them to capture a greater market share.\nWE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FALSE OR FRAUDULENT CLAIM LAWS\nThere are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement. In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment. Any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability including, but not limited to, criminal liability, which could adversely affect demand for our services and could force us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to address the failure. Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIF OUR PRODUCTS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH EVOLVING GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING OUR PRODUCTS\nWe may be subject to additional federal and state statutes and regulations in connection with offering services and products via the Internet. On an increasingly frequent basis, federal and state legislators are proposing laws and regulations that apply to Internet commerce and communications. Areas being affected by these regulations include user privacy, pricing, content, taxation, copyright protection, distribution, and quality of products and services. To the extent that our products and services are subject to these laws and regulations, and fail to comply, the sale of our products and services could be harmed.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE COMPANIES ACQUIRED BY US.\nUpon the closing of any acquisition we complete, we will need to successfully integrate the products, services and related assets, as well as internal controls into our business operations. If an acquisition is consummated, the integration of the acquired business, its products, services and related assets into our company may also be complex and time-consuming and, if the integration is not fully successful, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies or growth opportunities of an acquisition. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u25cf Integrating personnel, operations and systems, while maintaining focus on producing and delivering consistent, high quality products and services;\n\u25cf Coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;\n\u25cf Disruption of management\u2019s attention from our ongoing business operations;\n\u25cf Retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; and\n\u25cf Managing inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies, innovations and operations efficiencies or growth opportunities of an acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation. Furthermore, these acquisitions, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products, services or geographic markets, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business including risks and liabilities associated with litigation involving the acquired business. Any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions after we have expended resources on them.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effect of trends in the U.S. healthcare system.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effects in the utilization of the healthcare system in the United States. Our operations also may be adversely impacted by the recent trend to increased patient responsibility for payment for healthcare services, including laboratory services.\nChanges in payer regulations or policies, or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies, insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the Company.\nReductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of third-party payers may occur. Such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. Actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nOur business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, the law or regulations of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or the FDA or other federal, state or local agencies.\nThe clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories (regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, requiring that they be certified under federal law. CLIA does not pre-empt state law, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly.\nFailure by facilities, third party payers or physicians to comply with the ICD-10-Cm Code Set could negatively impact reimbursement, profitability, and cash flow and thereby affect Company revenues for the services we provide.\nThe Company believes that the facilities it may provide services to will remain in compliance with all material aspects with the current transactions and code sets rule. The failure of such facilities, third party payers or physicians to apply any code set could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections and materially impact our ability to be paid for services.\nFailure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, WHICH could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business.\nThe HIPAA privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under HITECH, establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information (\u201cPHI\u201d) by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of PHI. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:\n\u25cf the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the Company\u2019s services, and its healthcare operations activities;\n\u25cf a patient\u2019s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI;\n\u25cf administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive PHI; and\n\u25cf the protection of computing systems maintaining electronic PHI.\nWe receive certain personal and financial information about our clients and their patients. In addition, we depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security requirements as applicable. The privacy and security regulations establish a \u201cfloor\u201d and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, the Company is required to comply with both additional federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. In addition, for data transfers from and operations in other countries, the Company may also be required to comply with the data privacy and security laws of those other countries. HIPAA restricts the Company\u2019s ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data without patient authorization for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. In addition, foreign, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues.\nA failure to obtain and retain facility clients, a loss of existing facility client or material contracts, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing facility client, or the inability to retain existing and create new relationships with health systems could impact the Company's ability to successfully grow its business.\nTo offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services and to otherwise maintain and grow it business, the facilities services by the Company shall or may need to obtain and retain new customers and business partners. A reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing as germane to such facilities serviced by the Company, a decrease in demand for the services from existing clients, or the loss of existing contracts, without offsetting growth in its serviced facility customer base, could impact the company\u2019s ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s net revenues and profitability. The Company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of services and the Company\u2019s failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the Company\u2019s ability to expand its customer base.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY AND INNOVATIONS BUSINESS\nTHE PRICE OF WOODY BIOMASS AND OTHER RENEWABLE FEEDSTOCK COULD INCREASE OR BECOME VOLATILE, OR THEIR AVAILABILITY COULD BE REDUCED, WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE PRODUCTION COSTS OF OUR CELLULOSIC GASOLINE AND DIESEL.\nThe price of woody biomass and other renewable feedstock may increase or become volatile due to changes in demand, such as the increased use of such feedstock in the generation of renewable electricity. Such changes would result in higher feedstock prices and/or a significant decrease in the volume of woody biomass and other renewable feedstock available for the production of the cellulosic gasoline and diesel we plan to sell, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWE ARE VULNERABLE TO DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RENEWABLE FUEL PRODUCTION OPERATIONS BECAUSE ALL OUR PRODUCTION OPERATIONS EXIST IN A SINGLE FACILITY.\nBecause all of our production operations currently exist in a single facility in Wausau, Wisconsin, significant and prolonged disruptions at the facility would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our Wausau, Wisconsin facility is our only existing production facility and it is being brought to an idle state while we focus on the achievement of additional research and development milestones and financing. During the facility\u2019s early years of production and until the facility stabilizes operationally, the facility may be more susceptible to start-ups and shutdowns that will disrupt and delay our production activities for significant time periods. We may experience a number of such disruptions and delays. We do not know when or if we will achieve stable operations at the facility and this largely depends on our obtaining financing to fund ongoing operations, to fund the completion of our optimization projects and upgrades, and to restart operations at the facility. Even if we achieve steady-state operations at the facility, we will be required to perform periodic maintenance and turnarounds at the facility. All or a significant portion of the facility may be disrupted during maintenance or a turnaround. These disruptions will make any future revenue and cash flows unpredictable.\nOur operations also may be disrupted by external events such as an interruption of electricity, natural gas, water treatment or other utilities. Other potentially disruptive events include natural disasters, severe weather conditions, workplace or environmental accidents, mechanical failure, fires, explosions, interruptions of supply, work stoppage, losses of permits or authorizations or acts of terrorism. Some of these events can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension or cessation of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. We can provide no assurance that we will not incur losses related to these or other events beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies. Further, disruptions to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations during the period of time that the facility is not operating.\nWE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN CONVERTING TO ANOTHER FUEL SOURCE, AND EVEN IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL, THERE WILL BE OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER FUEL SOURCES.\nThere are additional technology and regulatory issues when considering biomass as an energy source. You therefore should not assume that we will be able to convert its plant to natural gas or to biomass, or on economical terms.\nEven if we successfully implement the conversion, we will still face regulatory and other risks related to natural gas and biomass. For example, there will still be air permit and emission limits requirements and issues that will need to be met by us. As another example, we will need to be able to secure adequate sources of supply of natural gas or biomass and at an economical price, and from reputable third parties. Some of the other possible biomass energy sources, such as lignin or woodwastes, may vary in availability from time to time due to various factors, such as the economic circumstances of the industry in question. Some of these other risks are not as equally applicable to coal.\nCOMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, INCLUDING CHANGES TO SUCH LAWS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur waste and energy services businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, primarily relating to air, waste (including residual ash from combustion) and water. Costs relating to compliance with these laws and regulations are material to our business. If our businesses fail to comply with these regulations, our cash flow and profitability could be adversely affected, and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability, damages and fines.\nIn addition, lawsuits or enforcement actions by federal, state, local and/or foreign regulatory agencies may materially increase our costs. Stricter environmental regulation of air emissions, solid waste handling or combustion, residual ash handling and disposal, and waste water discharge could materially affect our cash flow and profitability. Certain environmental laws make us potentially liable on a joint and several basis for the remediation of contamination at or emanating from properties or facilities we currently or formerly owned or operated or properties to which we arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Such liability is not limited to the cleanup of contamination we actually caused. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur liability relating to the remediation of contamination, including contamination we did not cause.\nExisting environmental laws and regulations have been and could be revised or reinterpreted, and future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to occur. This may materially increase the amount we must invest to bring our facilities into compliance, impose additional expense on our operations, limit our ability to operate at capacity, or at all, or otherwise impose structural changes to markets which would adversely affect our competitive positioning in those markets.\nCHANGES IN PUBLIC POLICIES AND LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS.\nThere has been substantial debate recently in the United States and abroad in the context of environmental and energy policies affecting climate change, the outcome of which could have a positive or negative influence on our existing business and our prospects for growing our business. Congress and several states have considered legislation and/or regulations designed to increase the proportion of the nation\u2019s electricity that is generated from technologies considered \u201cclean\u201d or \u201crenewable\u201d, through mandatory generation levels, tax incentives, and other means. For those sources of greenhouse gas emissions that are unable to meet the required limitations, such legislation could impose substantial financial burdens. The Trump administration has indicated that it generally favors traditional energy technologies. Our business and future prospects could be adversely affected if renewable technologies we use were either (i) disfavored in any new laws or regulations pursued by the Trump administration, or (ii) not included among those technologies identified in any final laws or regulations as favoring renewable technologies, or not included in the state plans to reduce carbon emissions, and therefore not entitled to the benefits of such laws, regulations, or plans. Further, if penalties for oil- or fuel-related pollution are reduced, regulations are reduced or waivers or credits become more readily available, the benefits of Innovations\u2019 environment-friendly technology could be minimized, resulting in reduced demand.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY AND OUR WASTE BUSINESS\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY LAWS, WHICH RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS AND INCREASE OUR COSTS.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health. These include, among other things, laws and regulations governing the use, treatment, storage and disposal of wastes and materials, air quality, water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances. Our compliance with existing regulatory requirements is costly, and continued changes in these regulations could increase our compliance costs. Government laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment. We are required to obtain and maintain permits that are subject to strict regulatory requirements and are difficult and costly to obtain and maintain. We may be unable to implement price increases sufficient to offset the cost of complying with these laws and regulations. In addition, regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for closure and post-closure monitoring at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums over the amounts that we have accrued. In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility, we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals, including those relating to zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.\nWE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN-UP COSTS OR LITIGATION THAT COULD CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND MATERIALLY DECREASE OUR EARNINGS.\nCERCLA, and analogous state laws provide for the remediation of contaminated facilities and impose strict joint and several liability for remediation costs on current and former owners or operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance. This liability is also imposed on persons who arrange for the disposal of and who transport such substances to the facility. Hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under CERCLA and their presence, even in small amounts, can result in substantial liability. The expense of conducting a cleanup can be significant. Notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances, we may have liability because these substances may be present in waste collected by us. The actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than the amounts that we might be required to accrue on our financial statements from time to time.\nIn addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations, we may incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties. As a result, we may be required to pay fines or our permits and licenses may be modified or revoked. We may in the future be a defendant in lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and private parties who assert claims alleging environmental damage, personal injury, property damage and/or violations of permits and licenses by us. A significant judgment against us, the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could curtail our business operations and may decrease our earnings.\nOUR BUSINESS IS CAPITAL INTENSIVE, REQUIRING ONGOING CASH OUTLAYS THAT MAY STRAIN OR CONSUME OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL AND FORCE US TO SELL ASSETS, INCUR DEBT, OR SELL EQUITY ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS.\nOur ability to remain competitive, grow and maintain operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital. Maintaining our existing operations and expanding them through internal growth or acquisitions requires large capital expenditures. As we undertake more acquisitions and further expand our operations, the amount we expend on capital will increase. These increases in expenditures may result in lower levels of working capital or require us to finance working capital deficits. We intend to continue to fund our cash needs through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility, if necessary. However, we may require additional equity or debt financing to fund our growth.\nWe do not have complete control over our future performance because it is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. It is possible that our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we may not otherwise have the capital resources, to allow us to make necessary capital expenditures. If this occurs, we may have to sell assets, restructure our debt or obtain additional equity capital, which could be dilutive to our stockholders. We may not be able to take any of the foregoing actions, and we may not be able to do so on terms favorable to us or our stockholders.\nTHE COMPANY\u2019S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT MAY RESULT IN THE FORECLOSURE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 PLEDGED ASSETS AND OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES.\nPursuant to the current Credit Agreement, the Lenders have agreed to extend certain credit facilities to the Company, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $89,100,000, consisting of $65,500,000 aggregate principal amount of Tranche A Term Loans (the \u201cTranche A Term Loans\u201d), $8,600,000 aggregate principal amount of Tranche B Term Loans (the \u201cTranche B Term Loans\u201d), $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of MultiDraw Term Loans (the \u201cMDTL Term Loans\u201d), and up to $5,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans (the \u201cRevolving Loans \u201d and, together with the Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and the MDTL Term Loans, the \u201cLoans\u201d). As of December 31, 2016, we had an outstanding principal balance of $43,195,000 under the Loans as in effect at such time, which is secured by a first position security interest in substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets in favor of Goldman Sachs Specialty Group, LP (\u201cGS\u201d), as collateral agent, for the benefit of the lenders and other secured parties. The Credit Agreement requires us to comply with a number of covenants, including restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness\u037e create or permit liens on assets\u037e make investments\u037e and pay dividends. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios set forth in the Credit Agreement and related documents or the occurrence of certain other specified events could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement (an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d). Events of Default under the Credit Agreement also include, without limitation, the Company\u2019s failure to make payments when due, defaults under other agreements, bankruptcy, changes of control and termination of a material contract. Due to our recent failures to comply with the leverage ratio and certain other covenants required under the Prior Credit Agreement, we entered into several amendments thereto. Any future Event(s) of Default under the Credit Agreement, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt, potential foreclosure on our assets and other adverse consequences.\nIF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVERAGE RATIOS SET FORTH IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE ME BE UNABLE TO DRAW DOWN ADDITIONAL FUNDS PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY NEED TO SEEK OTHER SOURCES OF CAPITAL, WHICH COULD BE ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS.\nAs a result of the Company\u2019s failure historically to comply with the leverage ratio under the Prior Credit Agreement, the Company was able to draw down additional funds under the Prior Credit Agreement solely as the result of the execution of the Fourth Amendment. Although the Credit Agreement currently provides for increased leverage ratios, in the future, the Company may not be able to draw down additional funds pursuant to the Credit Agreement until such time as either such leverage ratio complies with the requirements of the Credit Agreement and the Company can show that it reasonably expects to be in pro forma compliance with such ratios or the requisite lenders under the Credit Agreement waive such requirement or otherwise consent to advance additional funds (the Lenders under our Credit Agreement having no requirement to grant such a consent or waiver and there can be no assurance that any such consent or waiver would be forthcoming). Due to certain unanticipated delays in integration of landfill operations, including due to flooding in the St. Louis area in December 2015, the Company had historically not been able to maintain the leverage ratios set forth in the Prior Credit Agreement. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain leverage ratios under the Credit Agreement may be beyond the Company\u2019s control. If the Company is unable to draw down additional funds pursuant to the Credit Agreement, it may be required to seek other sources of capital, and such capital may only be available on terms that are substantially less favorable than the terms of the Credit Agreement.\nWE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS FOR OUR REVENUE.\nAt this time, the Company has a municipal contract that accounts for 11% of our long term contracted revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Because we depend on this customer for a large portion of our revenue, a loss of this customer could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. If this customer were to cease using our services, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nGOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES MAY ENACT CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS THAT COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS TO OPERATE.\nEnvironmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. Congress has considered recent proposed legislation directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and President Obama had indicated his support of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. EPA has proposed rules to regulate greenhouse gases, regional initiatives have formed to control greenhouse gases and certain of the states in which we operate are contemplating air pollution control regulations that are more stringent than existing and proposed federal regulations, in particular the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases. The adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases, including the imposition of fees or taxes, could adversely affect our collection operations. Changing environmental regulations could require us to take any number of actions, including the purchase of emission allowances or installation of additional pollution control technology, and could make some operations less profitable, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES.\nWe risk incurring significant environmental liabilities in connection with our use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste materials. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be liable if our operations are found to cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners, particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking water or soil. Under current law, we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved. This risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though acquisitions, because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations. Further, the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us. Additionally, we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and, under applicable law, we are treated as a successor to the prior owner. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO OPERATIONAL AND SAFETY RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY TO EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS.\nProviding environmental and waste management services, including operating landfills, involves risks such as vehicular accidents and equipment defects, malfunctions and failures. Additionally, there are risks associated with waste mass instability and releases of hazardous materials or odors. There may also be risks presented by the potential for subsurface chemical reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate, landfill gas and odors. Any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others, a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities, increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage, and property damage or destruction.\nWhile we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training, compliance and response and recovery programs, as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs, if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Any such incidents could also adversely impact our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Additionally, a major operational failure, even if suffered by a competitor, may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry, with a corresponding increase in operating expense.\nINCREASES IN THE COSTS OF FUEL MAY REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.\nThe price and supply of fuel needed to run our collection vehicles is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Any significant price escalations or reductions in the supply could increase our operating expenses or interrupt or curtail our operations. Failure to offset all or a portion of any increased fuel costs through increased fees or charges would reduce our operating margins.\nCHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WOULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.\nOur acquisitions could require us to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which will increase our interest expense. Further, to the extent that these borrowings are subject to variable rates of interest, increases in interest rates will increase our interest expense, which will affect our profitability. We bear exposure to, and are primarily affected by, changes in LIBOR rates.\nINCREASES IN THE COSTS OF DISPOSAL MAY REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.\nIn 2016, we disposed of approximately 70% of the waste that we collect in landfills operated by others, and that rate may not decrease significantly in the future. We may incur increases in disposal fees paid to third parties. Failure to pass these costs on to our customers may reduce our operating margins. In December 2015, the Company purchased Eagle Ridge Landfill, LLC and, in February 2017, the Company purchased two landfills located in Virginia, as part of the Company\u2019s strategy to internalize a majority of its volume.\nINCREASES IN THE COSTS OF LABOR MAY REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.\nWe compete with other businesses in our markets for qualified employees. A shortage of qualified employees would require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages to compete more effectively for employees or to hire more expensive temporary employees. Labor is our second largest operating cost, and even relatively small increases in labor costs per employee could materially affect our cost structure. Failure to attract and retain qualified employees, to control our labor costs, or to recover any increased labor costs through increased prices we charge for our services or otherwise offset such increases with cost savings in other areas may reduce our operating margins.\nINCREASES IN COSTS OF INSURANCE WOULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.\nOne of our largest operating costs is for insurance coverage, including general liability, automobile physical damage and liability, property, employment practices, pollution, directors and officers, fiduciary, workers\u2019 compensation and employer\u2019s liability coverage, as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in our primary general liability, automobile liability and employer\u2019s liability policies. Changes in our operating experience, such as an increase in accidents or lawsuits or a catastrophic loss, could cause our insurance costs to increase significantly or could cause us to be unable to obtain certain insurance. Increases in insurance costs would reduce our operating margins. Changes in our industry and perceived risks in our business could have a similar effect.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT INSURANCE COVERAGE TO COVER THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN UNINSURED LOSSES THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nIntegrated non-hazardous waste companies are exposed to a variety of risks that are typically covered by insurance arrangements. However, we may not be able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage to cover the risks associated with our operations for a variety of reasons. Increases in insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets may, given our resources, limit the coverage that we are able to maintain or prevent us from insuring against certain risks. Large or unexpected losses may exceed our policy limits, adversely affecting our results of operations, and may result in the termination or limitation of coverage, exposing us to uninsured losses, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition.\nOUR FAILURE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITH OUR NUMEROUS COMPETITORS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE GREATER RESOURCES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND OBTAIN FUTURE BUSINESS.\nBecause our industry is highly competitive, we compete with large companies and municipalities, many of whom have greater financial and operational resources. The non-hazardous solid waste collection and disposal industry includes large national, publicly-traded waste management companies; regional, publicly-held and privately-owned companies; and numerous small, local, privately-owned companies. Additionally, many counties and municipalities operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities and have competitive advantages not available to private enterprises. If we are unable to successfully compete against our competitors, our ability to retain existing customers and obtain future business could be adversely affected.\nWE MAY LOSE CONTRACTS THROUGH COMPETITIVE BIDDING, EARLY TERMINATION OR GOVERNMENTAL ACTION, OR WE MAY HAVE TO SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICES IN ORDER TO RETAIN CERTAIN CONTRACTS, ANY OF WHICH WOULD CAUSE OUR REVENUE TO DECLINE.\nWe are party to contracts with municipalities and other associations and agencies. Many of these contracts are or will be subject to competitive bidding. We may not be the successful bidder, or we may have to substantially lower prices in order to be the successful bidder. In addition, some of our customers may terminate their contracts with us before the end of the contract term. If we are not able to replace revenue from contracts lost through competitive bidding or early termination or from lowering prices or from the renegotiation of existing contracts with other revenue within a reasonable time period, our revenue could decline.\nMunicipalities may annex unincorporated areas within counties where we provide collection services, and as a result, our customers in annexed areas may be required to obtain service from competitors who have been franchised or contracted by the annexing municipalities to provide those services. Some of the local jurisdictions in which we currently operate grant exclusive franchises to collection and disposal companies, others may do so in the future, and we may enter markets where franchises are granted by certain municipalities. Unless we are awarded a franchise by these municipalities, we will lose customers, which will cause our revenue to decline.\nWe are currently pursuing through a bidding process the renewal of an agreement to which we are currently party, for the operation of a transfer station, scheduled to expire in the fourth quarter of 2016. If we are not awarded renewal of this agreement, we will be forced to utilize other transfer stations which would cause our revenue to decline.\nEFFORTS BY LABOR UNIONS TO ORGANIZE OUR EMPLOYEES COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND INCREASE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES.\nWe do not have any union representation in our operations. Groups of employees may seek union representation in the future, and the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, we might have to wait through \u201ccooling off\u201d periods, which are often followed by union-initiated work stoppages, including strikes. Depending on the type and duration of these work stoppages, our operating expenses could increase significantly.\nPOOR DECISIONS BY OUR REGIONAL AND LOCAL MANAGERS COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CUSTOMERS OR AN INCREASE IN COSTS, OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FUTURE BUSINESS.\nWe manage our operations on a decentralized basis. Therefore, regional and local managers have the authority to make many decisions concerning their operations without obtaining prior approval from executive officers. Poor decisions by regional or local managers could result in the loss of customers or an increase in costs, or adversely affect our ability to obtain future business.\nWE ARE VULNERABLE TO FACTORS AFFECTING OUR LOCAL MARKETS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS.\nBecause the non-hazardous waste business is local in nature, our business in one or more regions or local markets may be adversely affected by events and economic conditions relating to those regions or markets even if the other regions of the country are not affected. As a result, our financial performance may not compare favorably to our competitors with operations in other regions, and our stock price could be adversely affected by our inability to compete effectively with our competitors.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE SALE OF OUR WASTE ASSETS\nOUR ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OUR ASSETS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY BE LIMITED.\nWhen we sell any of our assets, we may not realize a gain on such sale or the amount of our taxable gain could exceed the cash proceeds we receive from such sale. We may determine to not distribute any proceeds from the sale of assets to our stockholders, and for the foreseeable future, we anticipate using the proceeds from sales (in each case if the asset can be disposed of for greater than the debt associated with it) to improve the quality and income-producing ability of our portfolio by engaging in selective acquisitions or reinvesting in our existing assets through capital expenditures and improving the capital structure of the portfolio, including by repaying debt or making capital improvements. Alternatively, we may elect to create working capital reserves, especially in light of the fact that we may not be able to reduce our operating overhead expenses to the same extent or on the same time frame as the reduction of operating revenues resulting from a sale of assets, which could materially adversely affect our operating margins.\nIF THE SALE OF OUR WASTE ASSETS (THE \u201cTRANSACTION\u201d) IS NOT COMPLETED, THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY PAYMEMT IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION.\nIf the Transaction is not completed for any reason, Meridian and Seller will not receive any payment in connection with the Transaction and will not be able to repay any of its indebtedness. Instead, the Acquired Entities will remain direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Meridian and Seller, and Meridian\u2019s shareholders will continue to own their shares of Common Stock. There is the possibility that, while the Transaction is expected to be completed, there are no assurances that all conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to complete the Transaction will be satisfied or waived, including Buyer\u2019s ability to obtain anticipated debt financing, and that as a result the Transaction might not be consummated. In addition, there is the possibility that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated during the 21 days following execution of the Purchase Agreement while Buyer completes its due diligence review. A failure to consummate the Transaction could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, the market price for the Common Stock and the Company\u2019s relationships with employees, suppliers, joint venture partners and other business partners, including that (i) the Company\u2019s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the Transaction; (ii) the Company may have abandoned or delayed certain projects and business opportunities; (iii) the Company will have incurred significant transaction costs; (iv) the market\u2019s perception of the Company\u2019s prospects could be adversely affected and (v) the potential inability of the Company to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards.\nIF THE TRANSACTION IS CONSUMMATED, THERE WILL BE NO PARTICIPATION IN THE WASTE BUSINESS\u2019S FUTURE GROWTH OR EARNINGS.\nIf the Transaction is consummated, the Company and its creditors will receive consideration in cash and will no longer have the opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of the Waste Business.\nINTERIM OPERATING COVENANTS.\nThe Purchase Agreement imposes limitations on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business prior to the consummation of the Transaction, requiring the Company to conduct its and its subsidiaries\u2019 business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and that such limitations may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities. This may negatively affect the Company\u2019s business.\nTHE COMPANY MAY NOT ENJOY FAVORABLE TAX TREATMENT.\nThe receipt of the consideration for the Transaction will generally be taxable to the Company, subject to the Company\u2019s ability to apply net operating loss carryforwards to shelter such taxable gain. This may not be favorable to the Company and may affect the Company\u2019s finances going forward.\nDIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INTERESTS IN THE TRANSACTION.\nIn addition to their interests in the Transaction as shareholders, certain of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the Transaction that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company\u2019s shareholders generally. You should be aware of these interests. The members of the Special Committee and the Board were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to recommend the approval of the Purchase Agreement and deem the Purchase Agreement, the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement to be fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders. These interests include:\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s 2016 Equity and Incentive Plan, which provides for acceleration of vesting of equity awards held by certain officers and directors of Meridian following the closing of the Transaction, subject to certain conditions;\n\u25cf Walter (\u201cWally\u201d) Hall, Jr. will enter into a new employment agreement with Buyer at the Closing;\n\u25cf certain financial guarantees issued by Mr. Cosman in favor of the Acquired Entities, which will be released in connection with the Transaction; and\n\u25cf the right to continued indemnification and insurance coverage for directors and executive officers of the Company following the closing of the Transaction, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.\nTHE COMPANY AND ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILL BE RESTRICTED FROM CONDUCTING BUSINESS RELATED TO THE WASTE BUSINESS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.\nIf the Transaction is consummated, Meridian, Seller and Mr. Cosman will cease their solid waste operations and be restricted from providing non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer and disposal services within Missouri and Virginia of the type currently conducted by the Acquired Entities for a period of five years pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. As a result, the Company\u2019s current shareholders will no longer benefit from any increase in the value, nor will they bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of the Waste Business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY GENERALLY\nSEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS WILL CAUSE OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO VARY AMONG QUARTERS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE.\nBased on historic trends experienced by the businesses we have acquired, we expect our operating results to vary seasonally, with revenue typically lowest in the first quarter, higher in the second and third quarters, and again lower in the fourth quarter. This seasonality generally reflects the lower volume of waste during the winter months. Adverse weather conditions negatively affect waste collection productivity, resulting in higher labor and operational costs. The general increase in precipitation during the winter months increases the weight of collected waste, resulting in higher disposal costs, as costs are often calculated on a per ton basis. Because of these factors, we expect operating income to be generally lower in the winter months. As a result, our operating results may be negatively affected by these variations. Additionally, severe weather during any time of the year can negatively affect the costs of collection and disposal and may cause temporary suspensions of our collection services. Long periods of inclement weather may interfere with collection operations and reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers. Any of these conditions can adversely affect our business and results of operations, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nWE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATIONS PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE KEY EMPLOYEES OR GROUPS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND PREVENT US FROM IMPLEMENTING OUR BUSINESS PLAN IN A TIMELY MANNER.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jeffrey S. Cosman. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Cosman. We maintain a key person life insurance policy on Mr. Cosman. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business.\nWE HAVE IDENTIFIED A MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS, WHICH COULD CAUSE STOCKHOLDERS AND PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS TO LOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING.\nCurrently, the Company has an Audit Committee to oversee the financial reporting process; however, for much of the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company did not have an Audit Committee. Accordingly, based on these material weaknesses, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective during the period of December 31, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules.\nTo address these weaknesses, the Company's management has added independent Directors so that the Company will have an Audit Committee that meets regulatory requirements for independence and financial expert experience. The Company also started the process of retaining additional staff to assist its internal staff with compliance issues.\nOUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGING REGULATIONS REGARDING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE THAT HAVE INCREASED BOTH OUR COSTS AND THE RISK OF NON-COMPLIANCE.\nWe are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. Our efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, our business may be harmed.\nWE NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO DEVELOP OUR BUSINESS.\nThe development of our services will require the commitment of substantial resources to implement our business plan. In addition, substantial expenditures will be required to enable us to complete projects in the future. Currently, we have a credit agreement with Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group. However, it is likely we would need to seek additional financing through subsequent future private or public offerings of our equity securities or through strategic partnerships and other arrangements with corporate partners.\nWe cannot give any assurance that any additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The occurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. If adequate additional financing is not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to implement our business development plan or continue our business operations.\nOUR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS OR ACTS OF FRAUD.\nAny disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must consider the benefits of controls relative to their costs. Inherent limitations within a control system include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. While the design of any system of controls is to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of disclosure controls, such design is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and such assumptions, while reasonable, may not take into account all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected.\nWE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND OTHERWISE SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL FINANCING, IF REQUIRED, OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\nWe intend to invest significantly in our business; therefore, we expect cash flows from operations to be inadequate to cover our anticipated expenses. We expect that we will need to obtain significant additional financing, both in the short and long-term, to make planned capital expenditures, to cover operating expenses, upgrades to our manufacturing operations, our ongoing product development and to fund to potential acquisitions, if any. We may not be able to secure adequate additional financing when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. To execute our business strategy, we may issue additional equity securities in public or private offerings. If we cannot secure sufficient additional funding we may be forced to forego strategic opportunities and/or delay, scale back or eliminate future development which would harm our business and our ability to generate positive cash flow in the future.\nWE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nOur ability to meet our obligations is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf the continued operation and maintenance of our facilities, consistent with historical performance levels;\n\u25cf maintenance or enhancement of revenue from renewals or replacement of existing contracts and from new contracts to expand existing facilities or operate additional facilities;\n\u25cf market conditions affecting waste disposal and energy pricing, as well as competition from other companies for contract renewals, expansions and additional contracts, particularly after our existing contracts expire;\n\u25cf the continued availability of the benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards; and\n\u25cf general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under our outstanding indebtedness, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWE WILL NEED TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF OUR ORGANIZATION, AND MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES IN MANAGING GROWTH.\nAt present, we are a small company. We expect to experience a period of expansion in headcount, infrastructure and overhead and anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth and market opportunities. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate new managers. Our future financial performance and ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, MAINTAIN OR ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights. In addition, we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, which could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf cease developing, performing or selling solutions or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right;\n\u25cf redesign or re-engineer our intellectual property;\n\u25cf change our business processes; or\n\u25cf pay substantial damages, court costs and attorneys' fees, including potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR SECURITIES\nTHE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS LIKELY TO BE VOLATILE AND COULD SUBJECT US TO LITIGATION.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:\n\u25cf\nvariations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;\n\u25cf\nissuances of new stock which dilutes earnings per share;\n\u25cf\nforward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share;\n\u25cf\nthe net increases in the number of customers and paying subscriptions, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\n\u25cf\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\ntrading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock.\nIn addition, if the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industries even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are to become the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nTHE OWNERSHIP BY OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK WILL LIKELY LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE CORPORATE MATTERS.\nMr. Jeffrey S. Cosman, our chief executive officer, is the beneficial owner of 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, our chief executive officer would have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. In addition, Mr. Cosman beneficially owns approximately 18% of our issued and outstanding common stock. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nALTHOUGH OUR SHARES AND WARRANTS HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, OUR SHARES MAY BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL DELISTING IF WE DO NOT MEET OR CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE LISTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, AND WE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED BY NASDAQ OF FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN LISTING REQUIREMENTS.\nOur shares and warrants have been approved for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) \u037e however, to keep our listing on Nasdaq, we are required to maintain: (i) a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, (ii) a certain public float, (iii) a certain number of round lot shareholders and (iv) one of the following: a net income from continuing operations (in the latest fiscal year or two of the three last fiscal years) of at least $500,000, a market value of listed securities of at least $35 million or a stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $2.5 million. On August 24, 2017, we were notified by the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Department that were not in compliance because we did not have a stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $2.5 million. We were granted a 180-calendar day period within which to regain compliance, which ended on February 20, 2018. On February 21, 2018, we were further notified that we were not in compliance because we did not satisfy such stockholders\u2019 equity requirement before February 20, 2018. The Company has filed for an appeal with Nasdaq\u2019s hearings panel, which is expected to take place in April 2018.\nAdditionally, on April 5, 2018, we were notified that by Nasdaq that the Company\u2019s closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days was less than $1.00 per share. As a result, the Company does not satisfy the continued listing requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Nasdaq Listing Rule 581(c)(3)(A) provides a compliance period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance.\nIn the event that our appeal to the Nasdaq hearings panel is ultimately unsuccessful, we are unable to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement, or, in the future, we are notified that we no longer comply with NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance requirements, and we fail to regain compliance within an applicable cure period, our common stock could be delisted from Nasdaq.\nIf our common stock is delisted, trading of the stock will most likely take place on the Over the Counter Market Place. An investor is likely to find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, our common stock on an over-the-counter market, and many investors may not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, or due to policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons, and our ability to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or otherwise to arrange for any financing we may need in the future, may also be materially and adversely affected if our common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange. For these reasons and others, delisting would adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume and price of our common stock, causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to attract and retain qualified executives and employees and to raise capital.\nOur stock price could fall and we could be delisted from NASDAQ in which case because they may be considered penny stocks and thus be subject to the penny stock rules, WHICH COULD RESULT IN U.S. broker-dealers BECOMING discouraged from effecting transactions in shares of our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted a number of rules to regulate \u201cpenny stock\u201d that restricts transactions involving stock which is deemed to be penny stock. Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules may have the effect of reducing the liquidity of penny stocks. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market if current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). Our securities have in the past constituted, and may again in the future constitute, \u201cpenny stock\u201d within the meaning of the rules. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon U.S. broker-dealers may discourage such broker-dealers from effecting transactions in shares of our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of such shares and impede their sale in the secondary market.\nA U.S. broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or \u201caccredited investor\u201d (generally, an individual with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations require the U.S. broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, a disclosure schedule prepared in accordance with SEC standards relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A U.S. broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the U.S. broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a U.S. broker-dealer is required to submit monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in a customer\u2019s account and information with respect to the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d\nStockholders should be aware that, according to the SEC, the market for \u201cpenny stocks\u201d has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) \u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, resulting in investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities.\nTHERE MAY BE RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR ABILITY TO RESELL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER RULE 144.\nCurrently, Rule 144 under the Securities Act permits the public resale of securities under certain conditions after a six or twelve month holding period by the seller, including requirements with respect to the manner of sale, sales volume restrictions, filing requirements and a requirement that certain information about the issuer is publicly available. At the time that stockholders intend to resell their shares under Rule 144, there can be no assurances that we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) or, if so, current in our reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, in order for stockholders to be eligible to rely on Rule 144 at such time.\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements of Rule 144 under the Federal securities laws, the various state securities laws may impose further restrictions on the ability of a holder to sell or transfer the shares of common stock.\nSALES OF OUR CURRENTLY ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING STOCK MAY BECOME FREELY TRADABLE PURSUANT TO RULE 144 AND MAY DILUTE THE MARKET FOR YOUR SHARES AND HAVE A DEPRESSIVE EFFECT ON THE PRICE OF THE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nA substantial majority of our outstanding shares of common stock are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. As restricted shares, these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that an Affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 144(a)(1)) of an issuer who has held restricted securities for a period of at least six months (one year after filing Form 10 information with the SEC for shell companies and former shell companies) may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1% of a company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale (the four calendar week rule does not apply to companies quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board). Rule 144 also permits, under certain circumstances, the sale of securities, without any limitation, by a person who is not an Affiliate of the Company and who has satisfied a one-year holding period. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Act, if available, or pursuant to subsequent registrations of our shares of common stock, may have a depressive effect upon the price of our shares of common stock in any active market that may develop.\nYOU MAY EXPERIENCE DILUTION OF YOUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST BECAUSE OF THE FUTURE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR PREFERRED STOCK.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 80,000,000 shares of capital stock, which includes 4,861,468 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value $0.001, for which the designations, rights and preferences may be established by the Board.\nWe may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are trading.\nPOSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECT OF ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 4,417,068 shares are available for issuance, with designations, rights and preferences as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. As a result of the foregoing, the Board of Directors can issue, without further shareholder approval, Preferred Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of Common Stock. The issuance of Preferred Stock could, under certain circumstances, discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nWE DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT BUY OUR COMMON STOCK EXPECTING TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS.\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock in the past, and do not anticipate that we will declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors will only realize an economic gain on their investment in our common stock if the price appreciates. Investors should not purchase our common stock expecting to receive cash dividends. Because we do not pay dividends, and there may be limited trading, investors may not have any manner to liquidate or receive any payment on their investment. Therefore, our failure to pay dividends may cause investors to not see any return on investment even if we are successful in our business operations. In addition, because we do not pay dividends we may have trouble raising additional funds, which could affect our ability to expand our business operations.\nOUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY FAIL TO MEET OR EXCEED THE EXPECTATIONS OF RESEARCH ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.\nOur financial condition and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following factors, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report:\n\u25cf our ability to obtain additional capital necessary to fund our ongoing operations;\n\u25cf our achievement of additional research and development milestones prior to restarting our Columbus facility;\n\u25cf the timing and results of our optimization projects;\n\u25cf timing of other milestones, operations and our planned commercial production facilities;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain additional capital necessary to expand our business in the future;\n\u25cf our ability to achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u25cf the feasibility of producing our targeted materials and on a commercial scale;\n\u25cf our ability to manage our potential growth, which is subject to our ability to successfully achieve \u201csteady state\u201d operations at our planned facilities;\n\u25cf loss of key personnel;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the price of and demand for petroleum-based products;\n\u25cf the availability of cost-effective renewable feedstock sources;\n\u25cf the existence of government programs and incentives or regulation;\n\u25cf potential issues related to our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner;\n\u25cf our dependence on, and the need to attract and retain, key management and other personnel;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf potential advantages that our competitors and potential competitors may have in securing funding or developing projects;\n\u25cf business interruptions such as hurricanes, natural disasters and accidents;\n\u25cf our ability to comply with laws and regulations;\n\u25cf our ability to properly handle and dispose of hazardous materials used in our business; and\n\u25cf our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\nWE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATION 14C UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE \u201cEXCHANGE ACT\u201d).\nOn November 29, 2017, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with five (5) accredited investors (the \u201cPurchasers\u201d). Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers purchased 1,868,933 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, par value $0.025 per share (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d) at a price of $1.03 per share of Common Stock, 736,948 Series A Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the \u201cSeries A Warrants\u201d), and 664,753 Series B Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the \u201cSeries B Warrants\u201d and, together with the Series A Warrants, the \u201cPurchaser Warrants\u201d) for an aggregate of $1,925,001.06 (the \u201cNovember 2017 Offering\u201d). On November 29, 2017, written consent of holders representing a majority of the voting power of the Company entitled to vote with respect to the Stock Issuance was specifically provided in order to satisfy Nasdaq Rule 5635(d). We inadvertently did not timely comply with the requirements of Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act. This would have required us to circulate an information statement describing the corporate action taken by the written consent of a majority of our shareholders at least 20 days prior to the effective date of the corporate action. Rule 14c-2(b) of the Exchange Act requires that actions approved by written consent cannot be taken until 20 calendar days have elapsed since the mailing of an Information Statement on Schedule 14C to the Company\u2019s stockholders. In connection with the November 2017 Offering, a violation of Rule 14c-2(b) may be found to have occurred, because we may not have complied with the timing requirements of Regulation 14C, subjecting the Company to potential penalties and/or other adverse consequences or liability. As a result of our failure to comply with Regulation 14C, the SEC may bring an enforcement action or commence litigation against us for failure to comply with Regulation 14C. If any claims or actions were to be brought against us relating to our lack of compliance with Regulation 14C, we could be subject to penalties, required to pay fines, make damages payments, or settlement payments. In addition, any claims or actions could force us to expend significant financial resources to defend ourselves, could divert the attention of our management from our core business and could harm our reputation.\nThe Company conducted a private placement offering of $3,000,000 of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \u201cSeries E Preferred Stock\u201d) and warrants (the \u201cSeries E Warrants\u201d) to purchase shares of Common Stock, par value $0.025 per share (the \u201cSeries E Offering\u201d). The designations, rights and preferences for the Series E Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries E Designations\u201d), filed as an amendment to the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation on October 23, 2017 in connection with the closing of the Series E Offering, in Section III.A., provide that upon \u201capproval of the issuance of the Series E Preferred, having such designations, rights and preferences as are set forth herein, by the Company\u2019s common stockholders and the holder of Series A Preferred Shares voting together as a group, each Holder shall have the right, at any time commencing after the issuance, to convert the Stated Value of such shares, as well as accrued but unpaid declared dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock (collectively \u201cConversion Amount\u201d) into fully paid and non- assessable shares of Common Stock of the Company (\u201cConversion Shares\u201d).\u201d Essentially, pursuant to the Series E Designations, the shareholders\u2019 approval of the issuance of the Series E Preferred, having the Series E Designations, is required as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the main economic terms of the Series E Designations, including the Conversion Price and issuance of dividends, but was not required as a condition precedent to the actual issuance of shares of Series E Preferred. The Series E Approval is required for the Company to comply with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5635(d), which requires shareholder approval prior to the issuance of securities in connection with a transaction other than a public offering involving (1) the sale, issuance or potential issuance by the Company of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) at a price less than the greater of book or market value which together with sales by officers, directors or Substantial Shareholders (as defined in the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules) of the Company equals 20% or more of common stock or 20% or more of the voting power outstanding before the issuance; or (2) the sale, issuance or potential issuance by the Company of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable common stock) equal to 20% or more of the common stock or 20% or more of the voting power outstanding before the issuance for less than the greater of book or market value of the stock. Such shareholder approval has been delivered via written consent; however, the Series E Approval is not yet effective because the requirements of Rule 14c have not yet been met, but will become effective on the date that is twenty (20) calendar days after the mailing of this Information Statement to stockholders. In the event that it is determined that the foregoing analysis is incorrect, a violation of Rule 14c-2(b) may be found to have occurred in connection with the Series E Offering, subjecting the Company to potential penalties and/or other adverse consequences or liability. As a result of any such failure to comply with Regulation 14C, the SEC may bring an enforcement action or commence litigation against us for failure to comply with Regulation 14C. If any claims or actions were to be brought against us relating to our lack of compliance with Regulation 14C, we could be subject to penalties, required to pay fines, make damages payments, or settlement payments. In addition, any claims or actions could force us to expend significant financial resources to defend ourselves, could divert the attention of our management from our core business and could harm our reputation.", "PERMNO": 82476, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "ATIS"}
