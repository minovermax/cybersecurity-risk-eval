{"cik": "1412486", "company": "Cocrystal Pharma, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated in this Annual Report. Each of these risk factors, either alone or taken together, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, and adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not know of or that we believe are immaterial that could also impair our business and financial position.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors before deciding whether to invest in the Company. If any of the events discussed in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the value and marketability of the common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL\nWe have never generated revenue and expect that due to the regulatory constraints on a drug development company with products in the pre-clinical stage, we may not ever generate revenue and may continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a preclinical-stage, biopharmaceutical discovery and development company. Since inception, our operations have been limited to organizing and staffing the Company, acquiring and developing intellectual property rights, developing our technology platform, undertaking basic research on viral replication enzyme targets and conducting preclinical studies for our initial programs. Thereafter, because of the need to complete clinical trials, establish safety and efficacy and obtaining regulatory approval, we do not anticipate generating revenue for at least 5 years and will continue to sustain large losses.\nBased on cash on hand as of December 31, 2015 of $9.3 million and subsequent financing received of $5.0 million, Cocrystal does not have the capital to finance operations for the next 12 months. This raises doubt about our ability to be a going concern.\nWe have not and may never file a New Drug Application (NDA) or its foreign equivalent, necessary to legally sell products in the U.S. of foreign markets.\nWe have devoted the majority of our financial resources to research and development. We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities. The results of our operations will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic alliances or grants. We anticipate our expenses will increase substantially if and as we continue our research and preclinical development of our product candidates. We anticipate that if we undertake clinical studies our expenses will increase even further.\nBecause we have yet to generate any revenue on which to evaluate our potential for future success and to determine if we will be able to execute our business plan, it is difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risk of success or failure of our business.\nOur ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with partners, to successfully complete the development of, obtain the regulatory approvals for and commercialize pharmaceutical product candidates. We have no pharmaceutical product candidates that have generated any commercial revenue, do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of pharmaceutical products in the near future, and might never generate revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical products. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, the following:\n\u00b7\nidentifying and validating new therapeutic strategies;\n\u00b7\ncompleting our research and preclinical development of pharmaceutical product candidates;\n\u00b7\ninitiating and completing clinical trials for pharmaceutical product candidates;\n\u00b7\nseeking and obtaining regulatory marketing approvals for pharmaceutical product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nestablishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties;\n\u00b7\nlaunching and commercializing pharmaceutical product candidates for which we obtain regulatory marketing approval, with a partner or, if launched independently, successfully establishing a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining, protecting, enforcing, defending and expanding our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u00b7\nattracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we cannot predict the timing or amount of increased expenses and when we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability, if ever. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to perform unanticipated studies and trials.\nEven if one or more pharmaceutical product candidates we independently develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved pharmaceutical product candidate. Moreover, if we can generate revenues from the sale of any approved pharmaceutical products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nIf we do not raise additional debt or equity capital, we may not be able to remain operational.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is very expensive. We expect our research and development expenses to substantially increase as we advance our product candidates toward clinical programs. In order to conduct these trials, we will need to raise additional capital to support our operations and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAs we move lead compounds through toxicology and other preclinical studies, also referred to as nonclinical studies, we will be required to file an Investigational New Drug application (\u201cIND\u201d) or its equivalent in foreign countries, and as we conduct clinical development of product candidates, we may have adverse results that may cause us to consume additional capital. Our partners may not elect to pursue the development and commercialization of our product candidates subject to our respective agreements with them. These events may increase our development costs more than we expect. We may need to raise additional capital or otherwise obtain funding through strategic alliances if we initiate clinical trials for new product candidates other than programs currently partnered. We will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, product candidates.\nIf we must secure additional financing, such additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates. We cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u00b7\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of any product candidates;\n\u00b7\nseek strategic alliances for research and development programs at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u00b7\nrelinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or any product candidates we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing development and commercialization efforts, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects or sufficient enough to render the Company unable to continue operations at all..\nRISKS RELATED TO THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCT CANDIDATES\nBecause the approach we are taking to discover and develop drugs is novel, it may never lead to marketable products.\nWe are concentrating our antiviral therapeutic product research and development efforts using our proprietary technology, and our future success depends on the continued successful development of this technology and the products derived from it. We have no drug products or drug product candidates. The scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop drug product candidates are relatively new and unproven. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing product candidates based on our approach is limited. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize drug product candidates based upon our technological approach, we may not become profitable and the value of our stock may decline.\nFurther, our focus on Cocrystal's technology for developing drugs, as opposed to relying entirely on more standard technologies for drug development, increases the risks associated with the ownership of our stock. If we are unsuccessful in developing any product candidates using Cocrystal's technology, we may be required to change the scope and direction of our product development activities. We may not identify and implement successfully an alternative product development strategy, and may as a result cease operations.\nIf we do not succeed in our efforts to identify or discover potential product candidates, your investment may be lost.\nThe success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to identify, develop and commercialize antiviral drug products, an extremely risky business. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for several reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nour research methodology or that of our partners may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u00b7\npotential product candidates may have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval; and\n\u00b7\nwe or our partners may change their development profiles for potential product candidates or abandon a therapeutic area.\nSuch events may force us to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could cause us to cease operations. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe intend to invest a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the identification and preclinical development of product candidates that target viral replication enzymes. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nsuccessful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nreceipt of marketing and pricing approvals from regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for product candidates;\n\u00b7\nestablishing and maintaining manufacturing relationships with third parties or establishing our own manufacturing capability; and\n\u00b7\ncommercializing our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully complete development of, or to successfully commercialize, our product candidates, which would materially harm our business. Most pharmaceutical products that do overcome the long odds of drug development and achieve commercialization still do not recoup their cost of capital. If we are unable to design and develop each drug to meet a commercial need far in the future, the approved drug may become a commercial failure and our investment in those development and commercialization efforts will have been commercially unsuccessful.\nWe may be unable to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of product candidates, we or our partners must conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products.\nEvents that may cause a delay or unsuccessful completion of clinical development include, as examples:\n\u00b7\ndelays in agreeing with the FDA or other regulatory authorities on final clinical trial design;\n\u00b7\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\ndelays in agreeing on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u00b7\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7\ndelays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of the product candidates to the clinical sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\ndelays caused by patients dropping out of a trial due to product side effects or disease progression;\n\u00b7\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u00b7\ntime required to add new clinical sites; or\n\u00b7\ndelays by our contract manufacturers in producing and delivering sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIf we or our partners must conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of any product candidates beyond those that are contemplated, or are unable to successfully complete clinical trials or other testing of any the product candidates, or if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we or our partners may:\n\u00b7\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u00b7\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u00b7\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u00b7\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u00b7\nremove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or in obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule if at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which would impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. Any inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development, whether independently or with our partners, could cause additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from our product candidates, including product sales, milestone payments, profit sharing or royalties.\nOur product candidates may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nAdverse events (\u201cAEs\u201d), that may be observed during clinical trials of our product candidates could cause us, other reviewing entities, clinical trial sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt such trials and could cause denial of regulatory approval. If AEs are observed in any clinical trials of our product candidates, including those our partners may develop under our alliance agreements, our or our partners\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory approval for product candidates may be negatively impacted.\nSerious or unexpected side effects caused by an approved product could result in significant negative consequences, including:\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw prior approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to add labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nThese events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our products and impair our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our partners.\nEven if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any revenue from a product.\nNeither we nor any partners we may have can commercialize a product until the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or its foreign equivalent, have reviewed and approved the product candidate. The regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or foreign regulatory authority recommends restrictions on approval or recommends non-approval.\nFollowing regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and the approved product may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in the United States, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. The holder of an approved New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d), must monitor and report AEs and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and other applicable federal and state laws, and are subject to FDA review.\nDrug product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d), and adherence to commitments made in the NDA. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we or our partners fail to comply with regulatory requirements following approval of our product candidates, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7\nissue a warning letter asserting we are in violation of the law;\n\u00b7\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to approve a pending NDA or supplements to an NDA submitted by us;\n\u00b7\nseize product; or\n\u00b7\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nOur defense of any government investigation of alleged violations of law, or any lawsuit alleging such violations, could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may prevent or inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenues.\nWe may not succeed in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to drug compounds and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nCompanies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve using hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. If contamination occurs or injury results from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough our workers\u2019 compensation insurance may cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against other potential liabilities. We may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may cause substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nCompliance with governmental regulations regarding the treatment of animals used in research could increase our operating costs, which would adversely affect the commercialization of our technology.\nThe Animal Welfare Act (\u201cAWA\u201d), is the federal law that covers the treatment of certain animals used in research. The AWA imposes a wide variety of specific regulations that govern the humane handling, care, treatment and transportation of certain animals by producers and users of research animals, most notably relating to personnel, facilities, sanitation, cage size, feeding, watering and shipping conditions. Third parties with whom we contract are subject to registration, inspections and reporting requirements. Some states have their own regulations, including general anti-cruelty legislation, which establish certain standards in handling animals. If we or our contractors fail to comply with regulations concerning the treatment of animals used in research, we may be subject to fines and penalties and adverse publicity, and our operations could be adversely affected.\nPublic perception of ethical and social issues may limit or discourage the type of research we conduct.\nOur clinical trials will involve people, and we and third parties with whom we contract also do research using animals. Governmental authorities could, for public health or other purposes, limit the use of human or animal research or prohibit the practice of our technology. In addition, animal rights activists could protest or make threats against our facilities, which may cause property damage and delay our research. Ethical and other concerns about our methods, such as our use of human subjects in clinical trials or our use of animal testing, could adversely affect our market acceptance.\nWe have limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical development activities and clinical trials necessary to obtain approvals for marketing our product candidates, including approval by the FDA.\nOur efforts to develop our product candidates are at an early stage. To date we have not entered a compound into human clinical trials. We may be unable to progress our product candidates undergoing preclinical testing into clinical trials. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will succeed, and favorable initial results from a clinical trial do not determine outcomes in subsequent clinical trials. The indications of use for which we are pursuing development may have clinical effectiveness endpoints not previously reviewed or validated by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, which may complicate or delay our effort to obtain marketing approval. We cannot guarantee that our clinical trials will succeed. In fact, most compounds fail in clinical trial, even at companies far larger and more experienced than us.\nWe have not obtained marketing approval or commercialized any of our product candidates. We may not successfully design or implement clinical trials required for marketing approval to market our product candidates. If we are unsuccessful in conducting and managing our preclinical development activities or clinical trials or obtaining marketing approvals, we might not be able to commercialize our product candidates, or might be significantly delayed in doing so, which will materially harm our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES\nIf we form strategic alliances which are unsuccessful or are terminated, we may be unable to develop or commercialize certain product candidates and we may be unable to generate revenues from our development programs.\nWe are likely to use third party alliance partners for financial, scientific, manufacturing, marketing and sales resources for the clinical development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates. These strategic alliances will likely constrain our control over development and commercialization of our product candidates, especially once a candidate has reached the stage of clinical development. Our ability to recognize revenues from successful strategic alliances may be impaired by several factors including:\n\u00b7\na partner may shift its priorities and resources away from our programs due to a change in business strategies, or a merger, acquisition, sale or downsizing of its company or business unit;\n\u00b7\na partner may cease development in therapeutic areas which are the subject of our strategic alliances;\n\u00b7\na partner may change the success criteria for a program or product candidate delaying or ceasing development of such program or candidate;\n\u00b7\na significant delay in initiation of certain development activities by a partner could also delay payment of milestones tied to such activities, impacting our ability to fund our own activities;\n\u00b7\na partner could develop a product that competes, either directly or indirectly, with an alliance product;\n\u00b7\na partner with commercialization obligations may not commit sufficient financial or human resources to the marketing, distribution or sale of a product;\n\u00b7\na partner with manufacturing responsibilities may encounter regulatory, resource or quality issues and be unable to meet demand requirements;\n\u00b7\na partner may exercise its rights under the agreement to terminate a strategic alliance;\n\u00b7\na dispute may arise between us and a partner concerning the research, development or commercialization of a program or product candidate resulting in a delay in milestones, royalty payments or termination of a program and possibly resulting in costly litigation or arbitration which may divert management attention and resources; and\n\u00b7\na partner may use our proprietary information or intellectual property to invite litigation from a third party or fail to maintain or prosecute intellectual property rights possibly jeopardizing our rights in such property.\nTermination of a strategic alliance may require us to seek out and establish alternative strategic alliances with third-party partners; this may not be possible, or we may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to us, in which case it may be necessary for us to limit the size or scope of one or more of our programs or increase our expenditures and seek additional funding by other means. Such events would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct some or all aspects of our compound formulation, research and preclinical testing, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not expect to independently conduct most and certainly not all aspects of our drug discovery activities, compound formulation research or preclinical testing of product candidates. We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct some aspects of our preclinical testing.\nIf these third parties terminate their engagements, we will need to enter into alternative arrangements which would delay our product development activities. Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For product candidates we develop and commercialize on our own, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our IND-enabling preclinical studies and clinical trials are conducted under the respective study plans and trial protocols.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our studies under regulatory requirements or our stated study plans and protocols, we will not be able to complete, or may be delayed in completing, the necessary preclinical studies to enable us or our partners to select viable product candidates for IND submissions and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully develop and commercialize such product candidates.\nWe intend to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our preclinical supplies, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce clinical supplies of any product candidates we advance into clinical trials and commercial supplies of any approved product candidates.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product candidates ourselves, including:\n\u00b7\nthe inability to meet any product specifications and quality requirements consistently;\n\u00b7\na delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing and product quality issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u00b7\ncosts and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;\n\u00b7\na failure to comply with cGMP and similar foreign standards;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u00b7\ntermination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u00b7\nthe reliance on a few sources, and sometimes, single sources for raw materials, such that if we cannot secure a sufficient supply of these product components, we cannot manufacture and sell product candidates in a timely fashion, in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms;\n\u00b7\nthe lack of qualified backup suppliers for any raw materials currently purchased from a single source supplier;\n\u00b7\noperations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier;\n\u00b7\ncarrier disruptions or increased costs beyond our control; and\n\u00b7\nfailing to deliver products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner.\nThese events could lead to clinical study delays or failure to obtain regulatory approval, or impact our ability to successfully commercialize future products. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA action, including injunction, recall, seizure or total or partial suspension of production.\nBecause we expect to rely on limited sources of supply for the drug substance and drug product of product candidates, any disruption in the chain of supply may cause a delay in developing and commercializing these product candidates.\nWe intend to establish manufacturing relationships with a limited number of suppliers to manufacture raw materials, the drug substance, and the drug product of any product candidate for which we are responsible for preclinical or clinical development. Each supplier may require licenses to manufacture such components if such processes are not owned by the supplier or in the public domain. As part of any marketing approval, a manufacturer and its processes must be qualified by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities prior to commercialization. If supply from the approved vendor is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. An alternative vendor would need to be qualified through an NDA or marketing authorization supplement, which could cause further delay. The FDA or other regulatory agencies outside of the United States may also require additional studies if a new supplier is relied upon for commercial production.\nThese factors could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our products successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of drug substance or drug product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue.\nManufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or delay commercialization.\nAs we scale up manufacturing of product candidates and conduct required stability testing, product, packaging, equipment and process-related issues may require refinement or resolution to proceed with any clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for commercial marketing. We may identify significant impurities or stability problems, which could cause increased scrutiny by regulatory agencies, delays in clinical programs and regulatory approval, significant increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for product candidates or any approved products.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\nWe expect to rely on Clinical Research Organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials. While we will have agreements governing their activities, we and our partners will have limited influence over their actual performance. Nevertheless, we or our partners will be responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its protocol, and all legal, regulatory and scientific standards. Our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWe, our partners and our CROs must comply with current Good Clinical Practices (\u201ccGCPs\u201d), as defined by the FDA and the International Conference on Harmonization, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of IND-enabling preclinical studies and clinical trials, to ensure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications. Our clinical trials will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate. If our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, fail to recruit properly qualified patients or fail to properly record or maintain patient data, we may be required to repeat such clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur contracted CROs will not be our employees, and we cannot control whether they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials, or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to failing to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our financial results and the commercial prospects for such products and any product candidates we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug products for any clinical trials we may conduct. Any performance failure by our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we cannot obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our future products and product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our future products and product candidates. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications we own or in-license may fail to result in patents with claims that cover the products in the United States or in other countries. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found; such prior art can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing based on a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may cause such patents to be narrowed or invalidated. Even if unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims.\nIf the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed regarding our programs or product candidates fail to issue or if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop product candidates, and threaten our ability to commercialize products. We cannot offer any assurances about which patents will issue or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent a patent application related to a product candidate. In certain situations, if we and one or more third parties have filed patent applications in the United States and claiming the same subject matter, an administrative proceeding can be initiated to determine which applicant is entitled to the patent on that subject matter. Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is 20 years after it is filed, although various extensions may be available. However the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the time during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced.\nBesides the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology not covered by patents. Although each of our employees agrees to assign their inventions to us through an employee inventions agreement, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. The FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, is considering whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear how the FDA\u2019s disclosure policies may change, if at all.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. We may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is substantial litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, and reexaminations and other post-grant proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cU.S. PTO\u201d), and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our partners are pursuing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be patent applications currently pending that may later result in patents that our product candidates may infringe. Third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes these patents. If any third-party patents were to be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patents were to be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nParties making intellectual property claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. If a claim of infringement against us succeeds, we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nWe may need to obtain licenses to intellectual property rights from third parties.\nWe may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our products, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales and other activities, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter such infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, or we may be required to defend the validity or enforceability of such patents, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue because our patents do not cover that technology. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions regarding our patents or patent applications or those of our partners or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may cause substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nBecause of the substantial amount of discovery required in intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities.\nWe may be subject to claims our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe employ individuals previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and if we succeed, litigation could cause substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees.\nBecause we face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. We have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may cause even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further because of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may develop, acquire or license drug products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate we may develop.\nAll of our programs are in a preclinical development stage and are targeted toward indications for which there are approved products on the market or product candidates in clinical development. We will face competition from other drugs that are or will be approved for the same therapeutic indications. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to leverage our experience in drug discovery and development to:\n\u00b7\ndiscover and develop therapeutics superior to other products in the market;\n\u00b7\nattract qualified scientific, product development and commercial personnel;\n\u00b7\nobtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our technology platform and product candidates;\n\u00b7\nobtain required regulatory approvals; and\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of new therapeutics.\nThe availability of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand, and the price we can charge, for any products we may develop and commercialize. We will not achieve our business plan if the acceptance of these products is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing drug products to our products, or if physicians switch to other new drug products or reserve our products for use in limited circumstances. The inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced drug products would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nEstablished pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make our product candidates less competitive. Any new product that competes with an approved product must typically demonstrate advantages, such as in efficacy, convenience, tolerability or safety, to overcome price competition and to succeed. Our competitors may obtain patent protection, receive approval by FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities or discover, develop and commercialize product candidates before we do, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon the acceptance of these product candidates by the medical community, including physicians, patients and healthcare payors.\nAssuming one or more product candidates achieve regulatory approval and we commence marketing such products, the market acceptance of any product candidates will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n\u00b7\nthe relative convenience, ease of administration and acceptance by physicians, patients and healthcare payors;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any AEs;\n\u00b7\nlimitations or warnings in the label approved by FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities for such products;\n\u00b7\navailability of alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our or any collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain hospital formulary approval; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party payor coverage or reimbursement.\nIf our current product candidates are approved, we expect sales to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, and as such, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would harm our business.\nIf coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available for our product candidates, it could make it difficult for us to sell products profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any product candidates we develop will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers, hospitals and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any product candidates. Also, inadequate reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our future products. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize product candidates we develop.\nWe cannot be certain if and when we will obtain formulary approval to allow us to sell any products we may develop and commercialize into our target markets. Obtaining formulary approval from hospitals and from payors can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Failure to obtain timely formulary approval will limit our commercial success.\nThere have been numerous legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the United States and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell products profitably. These legislative and/or regulatory changes may negatively impact the reimbursement for drug products, following approval. The availability of generic treatments may also substantially reduce reimbursement for our future products. The potential application of user fees to generic drug products may expedite approval of additional generic drug treatments. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with sale of any of our products, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our future products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed.\nIn some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. The European Union, or EU, provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of Cocrystal placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and tend to be priced significantly lower.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenues.\nWe do not have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. To market any products that may be approved, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or arrange with third parties to perform these services.\nOur current and future partners may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization due to factors beyond our control. If we are unable to establish effective alliances to enable the sale of our product candidates to healthcare professionals and in geographical regions, including the United States, that will not be covered by our own marketing and sales force, or if our potential future strategic partners do not successfully commercialize the product candidates, our ability to generate revenues from product sales will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not become profitable. We will be competing with many companies that have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize any approved products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we may enter into agreements with third parties to market them on a worldwide basis or in more limited geographical regions. We expect we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u00b7\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in foreign economies and markets;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u00b7\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could cause increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u00b7\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is endemic;\n\u00b7\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND INDUSTRY\nIf we lose key management or scientific personnel, cannot recruit qualified employees, directors, officers, or other personnel or experience increases in our compensation costs, our business may materially suffer.\nWe depend on principal members of our executive and research teams, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. We are highly dependent on our management team and our Chairman of the Board, Dr. Raymond Schinazi. We do not carry \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance on the lives of any of our employees or advisors. Furthermore, our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional personnel. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms the competition among numerous pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets. Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly. If we lose key employees, our business may suffer.\nIf we expand our organization, we may experience difficulties in managing growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe have 23 full-time employees. As our company matures, we expect to expand our employee base to increase our managerial, scientific and operational, commercial, financial and other resources and to hire more consultants and contractors. Future growth would impose significant additional responsibilities on our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants and contractors. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may cause weaknesses in our infrastructure, and give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as developing additional product candidates. If our management cannot effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize product candidates and compete will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth.\nAny relationships with customers and third party payors may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and commercialize those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. We may be subject to patient privacy regulation by the federal government and by the U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u00b7\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payer, including commercial insurers, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs.\nUsing our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may cause:\n\u00b7\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ncosts due to related litigation;\n\u00b7\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates; and\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.\nWe do not have any product liability insurance coverage. We anticipate obtaining such insurance prior to the commencement of any clinical trials but any such insurance coverage we obtain may not reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer. Insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If and when we obtain marketing approval for product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. Occasionally, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nBusiness interruptions could delay us in developing our future products.\nWe have locations in Washington and Georgia. We are vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes and tornados as well as other events that could disrupt our operations. We do not carry insurance for natural disasters and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nIf our information technology systems are hacked, a third party may misappropriate our trade secrets which could harm our business and future results of operations.\nWe keep some of our intellectual property, including trade secrets and results of our preclinical research on a central server, and our employees email such information to each other and to third parties outside of our offices. In addition, since we do not encrypt all of this information, there is a risk that hackers could misappropriate our intellectual property. Any such misappropriation could harm our business and future results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nBecause we are subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules, brokers cannot generally solicit the purchase of our common stock which adversely affects its liquidity and market price.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock on the Bulletin Board has been substantially less than $5.00 per share and therefore we are currently considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d according to SEC rules. This designation requires any broker-dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities.\nDue to factors beyond our control, our stock price may be volatile.\nCompanies trading in the stock market in general, and particularly the over-the-counter markets, including the OTCQB, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Our common stock price recently has experienced significant gains even though there has been no disclosure by us of any positive factors. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters which require stockholder approval.\nAs of March 10, 2016, our executive officers, directors, 5% stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 80% of our common stock. Therefore, these stockholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. These stockholders, acting together, may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including under our equity incentive plan, could cause additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nUnder our Equity Incentive Plans, our management may grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants. During 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 50 million shares for grant to our employees, directors and consultants. These additional shares are offered under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. During 2015, 21,970,000 stock options were granted under this plan. The number of shares available for future grant under the Equity Incentive Plans is approximately 28 million shares.\nIf we are subject to securities class action litigation, we may sustain material costs.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could cause substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nAs a public company, we are subject to investigations by the SEC and other federal and state regulatory agencies.\nThe Company cannot predict or determine whether any proceeding may be instituted in connection with any subpoena or the outcome of any proceeding that may be instituted. Responding to such investigations may consume significant financial resources and limit us from other programs with those resources. In addition, any adverse investigation result could have a significant adverse effect on the Company share price and on the ability of the Company to raise necessary capital.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d), and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that, with the RFS Pharma and Cocrystal Discovery mergers and other transactions that have occurred over the past three years, we may have triggered an \u201cownership change\u201d limitation. We may also experience ownership changes in the future because of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. If we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us. At the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We anticipate we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nBecause we may not attract the attention of major brokerage firms, it could have a material impact upon the price of our common stock.\nIt is not likely that securities analysts of major brokerage firms will provide research coverage for our common stock since the firm itself cannot recommend the purchase of our common stock under the penny stock rules referenced in the previous risk factor. The absence of such coverage limits the likelihood that an active market will develop for our common stock. It may also make it more difficult for us to attract new investors when we acquire additional capital.\nBecause many of our outstanding shares are freely tradable, sales of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nAs of March 10, 2016, we had approximately 704 million shares of common stock outstanding, approximately 103 million of which may be publicly sold under Rule 144. In general, Rule 144 provides that any non-affiliate of Cocrystal, who has held restricted common stock for at least six months, is entitled to sell their restricted stock freely, provided that we stay current in our SEC filings. After one year, a non-affiliate may sell without any restrictions.\nAn affiliate of the Company may sell after six months (subject to contractual restrictions as described above) with the following restrictions:\n(i)\nwe are current in our filings,\n(ii)\ncertain manner of sale provisions, and\n(iii)\nfiling of Form 144.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nWe may issue preferred which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and could depress our stock price.\nIn accordance with the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and the Stockholder Rights Agreement described above, our Board may issue one or more additional series of preferred stock that have more than one vote per share, so long as the Board obtains the majority approval of each of the groups of shareholders who formerly held our Series A and Series B. This could permit our Board to issue preferred stock to investors who support our management and give effective control of our business to our management. Issuance of preferred stock could block an acquisition resulting in both a drop in our stock price and a decline in interest of our common stock. This could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their common stock. This could also cause the market price of our common stock shares to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nIf we are not successful in completing preclinical or clinical testing or are unable to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities, we may suffer impairment on our IPR&D assets.\nIn-process research and development (IPR&D) represents a series of awarded patents, filed patent applications and an in-process research program acquired in the acquisition of RFS Pharma that are integral to the development of the Company\u2019s planned future products. In-process research and development represents an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Any series of preclinical and clinical outcomes that reduce the probability for technical and regulatory success, may trigger interim impairment testing. If our IPR&D becomes impaired, writedown on the carrying amount of these assets may result, which could depress our stock price. During 2015, we lowered our forecasts of future cash flows, which caused a reduction in our IPR&D, resulting in an impairment charge of $38.7 million.\nWe continue to have material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which could negatively impact our ability to raise capital and could result in increased costs to ensure compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404.\nDuring our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, we identified the following material weaknesses:\nWe did not maintain adequate segregation of duties in our accounting and financial reporting processes. We have not appropriately restricted access to our accounting applications to appropriate users and do not have processes in place that ensure that appropriate segregation of duties is maintained. The Company lacks sufficient qualified personnel to review conclusions reached for complex accounting transactions. Our internal control over this process would not allow for employees to detect a material misstatement in these areas in the normal course of performing their duties.\nWe do not have processes in place to ensure that all related party transactions, including those entered into with or on behalf of related parties, (1) have been identified, (2) are properly authorized prior to entering into the transaction, and (3) are properly monitored and evaluated for appropriate recording and presentation in the financial statements. We did not maintain an effective financial reporting process to prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Specifically, our process lacked timely and complete financial statement reviews and procedures to ensure all required disclosures were made in our financial statements. We also lacked a process to review information used to prepare our financial statements and disclosures and did not have adequate segregation of duties over preparation of the financial statements.\nIncreased costs could be incurred to remediate these material weaknesses and could involve upgrading or replacing the Company\u2019s accounting software, adding additional staff and providing additional training.", "PERMNO": 17351, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "COCP"}
