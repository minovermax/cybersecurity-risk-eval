{"cik": "716133", "company": "CINCINNATI BELL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us. Our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially affected by any of these risks.\nRisk Factors Related to our Business and Operations\nThe Company operates in highly competitive industries, and customers may not continue to purchase products or services, which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share.\nThe telecommunications industry is very competitive and the Company competes against larger, well-capitalized national providers. Competitors may reduce pricing, create new bundled offerings, or develop new technologies, products or services that they can offer in expanded geographic regions. Our competitors are expected to continuously upgrade their service quality and offerings. If the Company cannot continue to offer reliable, competitively priced, value-added services, or if the Company does not keep pace with technological advances and upgrades, competitive forces could adversely affect it through a loss of market share or a decrease in revenue and profit margins. The Company has lost access lines, and will likely continue to lose them as part of the customer base migrates to competitors or alternative products of the Company. These competitive factors could limit the Company's ability to grow revenue and cash flows despite the strategic initiatives implemented.\nThe Entertainment and Communications segment faces competition from other local exchange carriers, wireless service providers, inter-exchange carriers, cable, broadband and internet service providers, other telecom companies, niche fiber companies and companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Wireless providers, particularly those that provide unlimited wireless voice and data plans with no additional fees for long distance, offer customers a substitution for the Company\u2019s services. The Company believes wireless substitution accounts for the largest portion of its access line losses. Also, cable competitors that have existing service relationships with the Company's customers in the Entertainment and Communications segment offer substitution services, such as VoIP and long distance voice services in the Company's operating areas. As a result of wireless substitution and increased competition, legacy voice lines decreased by 14% in Cincinnati in 2018 compared to 2017.\nIn addition, our strategic products, particularly our fiber-based products, face competition from a number of different sources including cable operators, other telecom companies, niche fiber companies, and companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Increasingly, content owners are utilizing Internet-based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee for access to the content. Furthermore, due to consumer electronics innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices. Increased customer migration to these non-traditional entertainment products could result in increased churn and decreased penetration in our Consumer/SMB Fiber products. If the Company is unable to effectively implement strategies to attract and retain video and high-speed internet subscribers, retain access lines and long distance subscribers, or replace such customers with other sources of revenue, the Company's Entertainment and Communications segment will be adversely affected.\nThe IT Services and Hardware segment competes against numerous other information technology consulting, web-hosting, and computer system integration companies, many of which are large in scope and well-financed. Other competitors may consolidate with larger companies or acquire software application vendors or technology providers, which may provide competitive advantages. The Company believes that many of the participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve significant scale to compete effectively. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that could impede our ability to compete successfully in the market. The competitive forces described above could adversely affect the Company\u2019s IT Services and Hardware segment and have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may be unable to grow our revenues and cash flows despite the initiatives we have implemented.\nWe must produce adequate revenues and cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facilities, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our capital expenditures, fund our pension and other employee benefit obligations and pay preferred dividends pursuant to our dividend policy. We have identified some potential areas of opportunity and implemented several growth initiatives. We cannot be assured that these opportunities will be successful or that these initiatives will improve our financial position or our results of operations.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nFailure to anticipate the need to introduce new products and services, or to compete with new technologies, may compromise the Company\u2019s success in the telecommunications industry.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on being able to anticipate the needs of current and future business, carrier and consumer customers. The Company seeks to meet these needs through new product introductions, service quality and technological improvements. New products and services are important to the Company\u2019s success because its industry is technologically driven, such that new technologies can offer alternatives to the Company\u2019s existing services. The development of new technologies and products could accelerate the Company\u2019s loss of access lines or limit the growth from its strategic products, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s access lines, which generate a significant portion of its cash flows and profits, are decreasing in number. If the Company continues to experience access line losses similar to the past several years, its revenues, earnings and cash flows from operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of its revenues by delivering voice and data services over access lines. The Company's local telecommunications subsidiaries have experienced substantial access line losses over the past several years due to a number of factors, including wireless and broadband substitution and increased competition. The Company expects access line losses to continue into the foreseeable future. Failure to retain access lines without replacing such losses with an alternative source of revenue would adversely impact the Company's revenues, earnings and cash flow from operations.\nThe Company has provided alternative sources of revenue by way of our strategic products; however, these products may generate lower profit margins than our traditional services. In addition, as a larger portion of our customer base has already migrated to these new product offerings, a decreased growth rate of strategic products can be expected. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that the revenues generated from our new offerings will mitigate revenue losses from the reduced sales of our legacy products or that our new strategic offerings will be as successful as anticipated.\nNegotiations with the providers of content for our video programming may not be successful, potentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels, which could result in the loss of subscribers. In addition, due to the influence of some content providers, we may be forced to pay higher rates for some content, resulting in increased costs.\nWe must negotiate with the content owners of the programming that we carry. These content owners are the exclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed upon contract with a content owner, our existing agreements to carry this content may not be renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in our loss of customers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers own multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather than one, and carry and pay for content for which customers do not associate much value, in order to have access to other content that customers do associate value. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we do, and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such negotiations. As a result of these factors, the expense of content may continue to increase, and have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's failure to meet performance standards under its agreements could result in customers terminating their relationships with the Company, or customers being entitled to receive financial compensation, leading to reduced revenues and/or increased costs.\nThe Company's agreements with its customers contain various requirements regarding performance and levels of service. If the Company fails to provide the levels of service or performance required by its agreements, customers may be able to receive financial compensation, or may be able to terminate their relationship with the Company. In order to provide these levels of service, the Company is required to protect against human error, natural disasters, equipment failure, power failure, sabotage and vandalism, and have disaster recovery plans available in the event of disruption of service. The failure to address these or other events may result in a disruption of service. In addition, any inability to meet service level commitments, or other performance standards, could reduce the confidence of customers. Decreased customer confidence could impair the Company's ability to attract and retain customers, which could adversely affect the Company's ability to generate revenues and operating results.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue by serving a limited geographic area.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue by serving customers in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dayton, Ohio and the islands of Hawaii. Furthermore, because of Hawaii\u2019s geographic isolation, the successful operation and growth of the business in Hawaii is dependent on favorable economic and regulatory conditions in the state. An economic downturn or natural disaster occurring in any of these limited operating territories would have a disproportionate effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows compared to similar companies of a national scope and similar companies operating in different geographic areas.\nThe customer base for telecommunications services in Hawaii is small and geographically concentrated. The population of Hawaii is approximately 1.4 million, approximately 70% of whom live on the island of Oahu. Any adverse economic conditions affecting Oahu, or Hawaii generally, could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Labor shortages or increased labor costs in Hawaii could also have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may be subject to increased costs for goods and services that the Company is unable to control or defray as a result of operating in this limited territory. Increased expenses including, but not limited to, energy and health care could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nTwo large customers account for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues and accounts receivable. The loss or significant reduction in business from either one of these customers would cause operating revenues to decline and could negatively impact profitability and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2018 Verizon comprised 18% of consolidated accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2017, GE comprised 10% of consolidated accounts receivable. During 2016, GE contributed 11% to consolidated revenue. As a result of these concentrations, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected if the Company lost these customers or if services purchased were significantly reduced. In addition, if Verizon or GE were to default on their accounts receivable obligations, the Company would be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established. This would also negatively impact the available borrowing capacity under the Company's accounts receivable securitization facility (\"Receivables Facility\").\nMaintaining the Company's telecommunications networks requires significant capital expenditures, and the Company's inability or failure to maintain its telecommunications networks could have a material impact on its market share and ability to generate revenue.\nOver the past several years, the Company has improved its wireline network through increased capital expenditures for fiber optic cable in areas of its operating network. The Company intends to continue its capital expenditures for fiber optic cable.\nIn order to provide appropriate levels of service to the Company's customers, the network infrastructure must be protected against damage from human error, natural disasters, unexpected equipment failure, power loss or telecommunications failures, terrorism, sabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism. The Company's networks may not address all of the problems that may be encountered in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated problems, which may result in disruption of service to customers.\nThe Company may also incur significant additional capital expenditures as a result of unanticipated developments, regulatory changes and other events that impact the business.\nIncreases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers.\nVideo streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As utilization rates and availability of these services continue to grow, our high-speed Internet customers may use much more bandwidth than in the past. If this occurs, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers. We may not be able to recover the costs of the necessary network investments. This could result in an adverse impact to our results of operations and financial condition.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nWe may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our networks.\nThe law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on, stored or disseminated through their networks is still unsettled. As such, we could be exposed to legal claims relating to content disseminated on our networks. Claims could challenge the accuracy of materials on our network or could involve matters such as defamation, invasion of privacy or copyright infringement. If we need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks or are required to defend ourselves against such claims, our financial results would be negatively affected.\nAn IT and/or network security breach or cyber-attack may lead to unauthorized use or disabling of our network, theft of customer data, unauthorized use or publication of our confidential business information and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disruptions to our operations. Our inability to operate our wireline networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share. In addition, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Cyber attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. These risks may be heightened as we expand our managed services, data center services and cloud-based services. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber attack in the future. Significant security failures could result in the unauthorized use or disabling of our network elements. The costs associated with a major cyber attack could include material incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation, fines from regulatory authorities and damage to our reputation. If we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about the Company and intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or information technology security, it could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWeather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.\nOur business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. The potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.\nIn particular, from time to time the islands of Hawaii experience severe weather conditions such as high winds and heavy rainfall, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunami, which can overwhelm our employees, disrupt our services and severely damage our property. Such disruptions in service and damage to property could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or market price of our securities. Moreover, it is impossible to predict the extent to which climate change could cause extreme weather conditions to become more frequent or more extreme.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe regulation of the Company\u2019s businesses by federal and state authorities may, among other things, place the Company at a competitive disadvantage, restrict its ability to price its products and services competitively, and threaten its operating licenses.\nSeveral of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to regulatory oversight of varying degrees at both the state and federal levels, which may differ from the regulatory scrutiny faced by the Company\u2019s competitors. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is derived from pricing plans that are subject to regulatory review and approval. These regulated pricing plans limit the rates the Company can charge for some services while the competition has typically been able to set rates for services with limited or no restriction. In the future, regulatory initiatives that would put the Company at a competitive disadvantage or mandate lower rates for its services would result in lower profitability and cash flows for the Company. In addition, different regulatory interpretations of existing regulations or guidelines may affect the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses in future periods.\nAt the federal level, the Company\u2019s telecommunications services are subject to the Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the \"Act\"), including rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"). At the state level, CBT operates as the incumbent local exchange carrier (\u201cILEC\u201d) and carrier of last resort in portions of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, while Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. (\"HTI\") serves as the ILEC and carrier of last resort in Hawaii. As the ILEC in these states, these entities are subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commissions in those states. Various regulatory decisions or initiatives at the federal or state level may from time to time have a negative impact on CBT\u2019s and HTI\u2019s ability to compete in their respective markets. In addition, although less heavily regulated than the Company\u2019s ILEC operations, other subsidiaries are authorized to provide competitive local exchange service, long distance, and cable television service in various states, and are consequently also subject to various state and federal telecommunications and cable regulations that could adversely impact their operations.\nThere are currently many regulatory actions under way and being contemplated by federal and state authorities regarding issues that could result in significant changes to the business conditions in the telecommunications industry. In addition, in connection with our Internet access offerings, we could become subject to laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the Internet. There is currently only limited regulation applicable to these services although court decisions and/or legislative action could lead to greater regulation of the Internet (including Internet access services). We cannot provide any assurances that changes in current or future regulations adopted by the FCC or state regulators, or other legislative, administrative, or judicial initiatives relating to the telecommunications industry, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, different regulatory agencies conduct audits to ensure that the Company is in compliance with the respective regulations. The Company could be subject to fines and penalties if found to be out of compliance with these regulations, and these fines and penalties could be material to the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe inability of the Company to renew its license from the FCC to use the Hawaii Inter-Island Cable System (\u201cHICS Cable\u201d) on economically reasonable terms may negatively impact its ability to provide telecommunication services to the islands of Hawaii.\nAs a part of providing telecommunication services to the islands of Hawaii, the Company uses the Hawaii Inter-Island Cable System (\u201cHICS Cable\u201d) which is regulated by the FCC. The Company\u2019s license to use the HICS Cable expires in July 2019. Although the Company is seeking an extension of its license to access the HICS Cable, it cannot guarantee that either its license will be renewed or that any renewal terms of cost or scope of access will not be materially detrimental to continued use of the HICS Cable by the Company. If the Company\u2019s license for the HICS Cable is not renewed on terms reasonable to the Company, the Company may not be able to provide its telecommunication services to the islands of Hawaii in a cost-efficient manner, which may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s customer relations and revenues.\nThe Company depends on a number of third-party providers, and the loss of, or problems with, one or more of these providers may impede the Company's growth or cause it to lose customers.\nThe Company depends on third-party providers to supply products and services. For example, many of the Company's information technology and call center functions are performed by third-party providers, and network equipment is purchased from and maintained by vendors. The loss of, or problems with, one or more of these third-party providers may result in an adverse effect on our ability to provide products and services to our customers and on our results of operations and financial condition.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nA failure of back-office information technology systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe efficient operation of the Company\u2019s business depends on back-office information technology systems. The Company relies on back-office information technology systems to effectively manage customer billing, business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. A failure of the Company\u2019s information technology systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and result in a failure to collect accounts receivable, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing the Company\u2019s reputation and results of operations to suffer. In addition, information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nIf the Company fails to extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements with its labor unions when they expire, or if its unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, the Company\u2019s business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nThe Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with its labor unions in both the Cincinnati and Hawaii operating territories, which represents approximately 35% of its employees. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements in the future. If the Company fails to extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with its union arise, or if its unionized workers engage in a strike or a work stoppage, the Company could experience a significant disruption of operations or incur higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the business.\nThe loss of any of the senior management team or attrition among key sales associates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s success will continue to depend on its senior management team and key sales associates and the Company\u2019s ability to retain such key management personnel and other key employees. Senior management has specific knowledge relating to the Company and the industry that would be difficult to replace. In particular, the success of the Company\u2019s acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom will depend in part on the ability of the Company to retain key management and other key personnel of Hawaiian Telcom after the acquisition and to continue to attract such persons to the Company. The loss of key sales associates could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to continue to benefit from long-standing relationships with customers. The Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to retain the current senior management team or key sales associates nor any key management personnel or other key employees from Hawaiian Telcom. The loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may not achieve its intended results from recent acquisitions if the Company is unable to successfully integrate the operations from the acquired companies with the Company.\nThe Company completed the acquisition of OnX in October 2017 and Hawaiian Telcom in July 2018. The acquisitions were made with the expectation that they would result in various benefits, including, among other things, expanding the Company\u2019s asset base and creating synergies and opportunities for cost savings. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of the Company, OnX and Hawaiian Telcom can be fully integrated in an efficient and effective manner.\nWhile the Company continues to actively effectuate this integration, it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions of OnX and Hawaiian Telcom. The Company\u2019s results of operations could also be adversely affected by any issues attributable to an acquired company\u2019s operations that arose or are based on events or actions that occurred prior to the closing of the acquisition. The integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe Company may incur expenses related to the integration of acquired operations, including OnX and Hawaiian Telcom, into the Company.\nThe Company is incurring expenses in connection with the integration of the Company and the operations of acquired companies, in particular OnX and Hawaiian Telcom. There are a number of back-office information technology systems, processes and policies that are being addressed during the integration. While the Company has assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred and have been incurred, there are many factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration expenses likely will result in the Company taking charges against earnings in the future, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.\nThe future results of the Company will suffer if the Company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the acquisitions of OnX and Hawaiian Telcom.\nThe size of the Company has increased significantly as a result of the acquisitions of OnX and Hawaiian Telcom. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which could pose substantial challenges for management. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits anticipated deriving from these acquisitions.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nThe Company\u2019s debt could limit its ability to fund operations, raise additional capital, and fulfill its obligations, which, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on its businesses and prospects generally.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries had outstanding indebtedness of $1,929.8 million, on which it incurred $131.5 million of interest expense in 2018, and had a total shareowners\u2019 deficit of $75.0 million. In October 2017, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a five year $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility including both a letter of credit subfacility of up to $30 million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to $25 million (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") and (ii) a seven-year $600 million senior secured term loan facility (the \"Tranche B Term Loan due 2024\"). At December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries had $9.1 million of borrowing availability under its Receivables Facility and had the ability to borrow up to an additional $182.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to compliance with certain conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s debt has important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe Company is required to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on its debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nthere is a variable interest rate on a portion of its debt which will increase if the market interest rates increase;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s debt increases its vulnerability to adverse changes in the credit markets, which adverse changes could increase the Company's borrowing costs and limit the availability of financing;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s debt service obligations limit its flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in its business and the industries in which it operates;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s level of debt and shareowners\u2019 deficit may restrict it from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s debt instruments contain limitations on the Company and require the Company to comply with specified financial ratios and other restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants, if not cured or waived, could limit availability to the cash required to fund the Company's operations and general obligations and could result in the Company\u2019s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.\nIn addition, certain of our variable rate debt uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe Company\u2019s creditors and preferred stockholders have claims that are superior to claims of the holders of the Company's common stock. Accordingly, in the event of the Company\u2019s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization, payment is first made on the claims of creditors of the Company and its subsidiaries, then preferred stockholders, and finally, if amounts are available, to holders of the Company's common stock.\nThe Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Company's notes due 2024, the indenture governing the Company's notes due 2025 and other indebtedness impose significant restrictions on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s debt instruments impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on the Company. These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase equity interests;\n\u2022\nredeem debt that is junior in right of payment to such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissue or sell capital stock of certain of its subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; and\n\u2022\nchange its fiscal year\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s Credit Agreement and debt instruments include restrictive covenants that may materially limit the Company\u2019s ability to prepay debt and redeem preferred stock. The agreements governing the Credit Agreement also require the Company to achieve and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios.\nThe restrictions contained in the terms of the Credit Agreement and its other debt instruments could:\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict the Company\u2019s activities or business plans; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to finance its operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, other capital needs, or to engage in other business activities that would be in its interest.\nA breach of any of the debt's restrictive covenants or the Company\u2019s inability to comply with the required financial ratios would result in a default under some or all of the debt agreements. During the occurrence and continuance of a default, lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Additionally, under the Credit Agreement, the lenders may elect not to provide loans under the Revolving Credit Facility until such default is cured or waived. The Company\u2019s debt instruments also contain cross-acceleration provisions, which generally cause each instrument to be subject to early repayment of outstanding principal and related interest upon a qualifying acceleration of any other debt instrument. Failure to comply with these covenants, if not cured or waived, would limit the cash available to the Company required to fund operations and its general obligations and could result in the Company\u2019s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.\nThe Company depends on its Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Facility to provide for its short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations, and the availability of those funds may be reduced or limited.\nThe Company depends on the Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Facility to provide for short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of October 2022. The Receivables Facility has a termination date of May 2021, and is subject to renewal every 364 days, with the next renewal occurring in May 2019.\nThe Company's ability to borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility is subject to the Company's compliance with covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios. Failure to satisfy these covenants would constrain or prohibit its ability to borrow under these facilities.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had $18.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $182.0 million in additional borrowing availability under this facility. The $200.0 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility is funded by various financial institutions. If one or more of these banks is not able to fulfill its funding obligations, the Company\u2019s financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had a total borrowing capacity of $193.7 million on a maximum borrowing capacity of $225.0 million on its Receivables Facility. At that date, there were $176.6 million of outstanding borrowings and $8.0 million of outstanding letters of credit. The available borrowing capacity is calculated monthly based on the amount, and quality, of outstanding accounts receivable, and thus may be lower than the maximum borrowing limit. If the quality of the Company\u2019s accounts receivables deteriorates, this will negatively impact the available capacity under this facility. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $9.1 million of borrowing capacity remaining under its Receivables Facility.\nThe servicing of the Company\u2019s indebtedness is dependent on its ability to generate cash, which could be impacted by many factors beyond its control.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond its control. The Company cannot provide assurance that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that additional sources of debt financing will be available, or that future borrowings will be available under its Revolving Credit Facility Credit or Receivables Facility, in each case, in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to service its indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If the Company cannot service its indebtedness, it will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing indebtedness, or seeking additional equity capital, which may adversely affect its shareholders, debt holders and customers. The Company may not be able to negotiate remedies on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict the Company from adopting any of these alternatives. The Company\u2019s inability to generate the necessary cash flows could result in its dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.\nThe Company depends on the receipt of dividends or other intercompany transfers from its subsidiaries and investments.\nVirtually all of the Company's operations are conducted through its subsidiaries and most of the Company's debt is held at the parent company. Certain of the Company's material subsidiaries are subject to regulatory authority which may potentially limit the ability of such subsidiaries to distribute funds or assets. If any of the Company's subsidiaries were to be prohibited from paying dividends or making distributions, the Company may not be able to make the scheduled interest and principal repayments on its debt. This failure would have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and the trading price of the Company's common stock, preferred stock, and debt instruments, which could result in its dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.\nOther Risk Factors\nThe trading price of the Company's common stock may be volatile, and the value of an investment in the Company's common stock may decline.\nThe market price of the Company's common stock has been volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this report and other factors beyond the Company's control, such as volatility in equity markets and fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to the Company.\nEquity markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the Company's stock price and the market prices of equity securities of many other companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions, may negatively affect the market price of the Company's stock.\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of common shares have periodically been subject to securities class action litigation. The Company may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and/or damages and divert management's attention from other business concerns.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe uncertain economic environment, including uncertainty in the U.S. and world securities markets, could impact the Company's business and financial condition.\nThe uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and financial liquidity. The Company's primary source of cash is customer collections. If economic conditions were to worsen, some customers may cancel services or have difficulty paying their accounts receivable. These conditions would result in lower revenues and increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts, which would negatively affect the results of operations. Furthermore, the sales cycle would be further lengthened if business customers slow spending or delay decision-making on the Company's products and services, which would adversely affect revenues. If competitors lower prices as a result of economic conditions, the Company would also experience pricing pressure. If the economies of the U.S. and the world deteriorate, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s future cash flows could be adversely affected if it is unable to fully realize its deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had deferred tax assets of $244.2 million, which are primarily composed of deferred tax assets associated with U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $124.4 million, state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $58.3 million, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $1.3 million. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to certain state, local and foreign net operating losses and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the Company\u2019s ability to utilize the assets within the statutory expiration period. In addition the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the portion of interest expense that is not currently deductible for domestic federal income tax due to the The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") effective December 31, 2017. The use of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets enables it to satisfy current and future tax liabilities without the use of the Company\u2019s cash resources. If the Company is unable for any reason to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize its deferred tax assets, or if the use of its net operating loss carryforwards is limited by Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or similar state statutes, the Company\u2019s net income, shareowners\u2019 deficit and future cash flows would be adversely affected.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations, and actions by federal, state and local taxing authorities related to the interpretation and application of such tax laws and regulations, could have a negative impact on the Company's financial results and cash flows.\nThe Company calculates, collects and remits various federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges, and regulatory fees to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including but not limited to federal Universal Service Fund contributions, sales tax, regulatory fees and use tax on purchases of goods and services used in our business. Tax laws are subject to change, and new interpretations of how various statutes and regulations should be adhered to are frequently issued. In many cases, the application of tax laws are uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud services. In the event that we have incorrectly calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts due to governmental authorities, or if revenue and taxing authorities disagree with positions we have taken, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions. In the event that federal, state, or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes on goods and services used to construct and maintain our network, operations, or provision of services, or seek to impose new taxes, there could be a material adverse impact on financial results.\nThe Company's interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 could change, and have an adverse impact on financial results.\nThe Tax Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. Corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, and elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax. The final impact of the Tax Act may differ from what the Company has currently recorded, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action taken to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to amounts recorded to calculate the transition impacts.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nAdverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with the Company\u2019s employee benefit plans could negatively impact shareowners\u2019 deficit and liquidity.\nThe Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for eligible management employees, non-management employees and certain former executives. The Company also provides healthcare and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. The Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets indirectly reflect the value of all plan assets and benefit obligations under these plans. The accounting for employee benefit plans is complex, as is the process of calculating the benefit obligations under the plans. Adverse changes in interest rates or market conditions, among other assumptions and factors, could cause a significant increase in the Company\u2019s benefit obligations or a significant decrease of the asset values, without necessarily impacting the Company\u2019s net income. In addition, the Company\u2019s benefit obligations could increase significantly if it needs to unfavorably revise the assumptions used to calculate the obligations. These adverse changes could have a further significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s shareowners\u2019 deficit. Additionally, the Company\u2019s postretirement costs are adversely affected by increases in medical and prescription drug costs. Further, if there are adverse changes to plan assets or if medical and prescription drug costs increase significantly, the Company could be required to contribute additional material amounts of cash to the plans, or to accelerate the timing of required payments.\nThird parties may claim that the Company is infringing upon their intellectual property, and the Company could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.\nThe Company may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of its technology, products or services. Any litigation growing out of third-party patents or other intellectual property claims could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the Company\u2019s management and key personnel from its business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increases these risks. Resolution of claims of intellectual property infringement might also require the Company to enter into costly license agreements. Likewise, the Company may not be able to obtain license agreements on acceptable terms. The Company also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of certain of its products or services. Further, the Company often relies on licenses of third-party intellectual property for its businesses. The Company cannot ensure these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nThird parties may infringe upon the Company\u2019s intellectual property, and the Company may expend significant resources enforcing its rights or suffer competitive injury.\nThe Company\u2019s success significantly depends on the competitive advantage it gains from its proprietary technology and other valuable intellectual property assets. The Company relies on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets protections, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. If the Company fails to successfully enforce its intellectual property rights, its competitive position could suffer, which could harm its operating results.\nThe Company may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police its intellectual property rights. The Company may not be able to detect third-party infringements and its competitive position may be harmed before the Company does so. In addition, competitors may design around the Company\u2019s technology or develop competing technologies. Furthermore, some intellectual property rights are licensed to other companies, allowing them to compete with the Company using that intellectual property.\nThe Company could be subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require the Company to pay significant damages or settlements.\nThe industry that the Company operates in faces a substantial risk of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, securities class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection processes. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards and settlements.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with, or potential violations of, environmental, health and human safety laws.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health, and human safety, including those governing the management and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and the cleanup of contamination, and the emission of radio frequencies. While the Company believes its operations are in substantial compliance with environmental, health, and human safety laws and regulations, as an owner or operator of property, and in connection with the current and historical use of hazardous materials and other operations at its sites, the Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with or violations of such laws, the imposition of cleanup obligations and third-party suits. For instance, a number of the Company\u2019s sites formerly contained underground storage tanks for the storage of used oil and fuel for back-up generators and vehicles.", "PERMNO": 47677, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "CBB"}
