RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating the Company and its business. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Further, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company does not presently know or that are currently not deemed significant to the Company's business may also impair the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of the Company's control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe Company's ability to obtain and retain order volumes from customers who represent high proportions of revenue;\n\u00b7\nthe Company's ability to maintain the pricing model, offset higher costs with price increases and/or decrease the cost of sales;\n\u00b7\nthe variability of customer delivery requirements and the ability of the Company to anticipate and respond thereto;\n\u00b7\nthe level of sales of higher margin products and services and the Company's ability to increase such sales;\n\u00b7\nvolatility in commodity and energy prices and the Company's ability to offset higher costs with price increases;\n\u00b7\nthe Company's ability to renew its credit facility and manage its level of debt which makes the Company sensitive to the effects of economic downturns; the Company's level of debt and provisions in the debt agreements could limit the Company's ability to react to changes in the economy or its industry;\n\u00b7\nthe Company's failure to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in its credit facility, including as a result of events beyond its control, which could result in an event of default, and adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial condition;\n\u00b7\nthe Company\u2019s reliance on revenue from exports and the impact on the Company\u2019s financial results due to economic uncertainty, changes in trade policy, tax laws and regulations, or downturns in foreign markets;\n\u00b7\ncontinued availability of supplies or materials used in manufacturing at competitive prices;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of investments in capital equipment, sales and marketing, engineering and information technology resources;\n\u00b7\nthe Company's ability to attract and retain employees with the skills to meet the technically complex demands of manufacturing;\n\u00b7\nentrance of competitive products and services in the Company's markets;\n\u00b7\nthe Company's ability to execute plans and motivate personnel in the execution of those plans;\n\u00b7\nthe Company's ability to protect and retain trade secrets related to the Company's manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7\nadverse claims relating to the Company's intellectual property and product liability claims affecting the Company's products;\n\u00b7\nadoption of new, or changes in, accounting principles; and passage of new, or changes in regulations;\n\u00b7\nadverse regulatory developments specifically healthcare policy changes, environmental and other regulatory changes;\n\u00b7\nthe costs inherent with complying with statutes and regulations applicable to public reporting companies, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010;\n\u00b7\nthe Company's ability to efficiently integrate future acquisitions and new lines of business that the Company may enter in the future, if any;\n\u00b7\nthe Company's ability to maintain compliance with the NYSE MKT requirements for continued listing of the Company's common stock in which event the Company's securities may be delisted from the NYSE MKT which could limit investors' ability to effect transactions in the Company's securities and subject the stock to additional trading restrictions;\n\u00b7\nother risks referenced from time to time elsewhere in this report and in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions.\n\ufeff\nAs a response to changes in the competitive environment, the Company may from time to time make certain pricing, service, technology or marketing decisions, or business or technology acquisitions, or experience fluctuations or reductions in customer orders that could have a material adverse effect on the quarterly and annual results. Due to all of these factors, the operating results may fall below the expectations of stockholders and investors in any future period and make period to period comparisons difficult.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is dependent on a limited number of large customers. The loss of, or inability to obtain and retain order volumes from, one or more of these customers, could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had net sales to two customers constituting 19% and 12% of total 2016 net sales. Accounts receivable from these two customers at December 31, 2016 was 26% and 7%, respectively, of the total accounts receivable balance at year end. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had net sales to two customers constituting 16% and 13%, respectively, of total 2015 net sales. Accounts receivable from these two customers at December 31, 2015 was 9% for each of the total accounts receivable balance at year end.\n\ufeff\nSales to the largest two customers accounted for 31% of total net sales in 2016 whereas in 2015 the top two customers accounted for 29% of total net sales. Large corporations can change their demand for the Company's products and services with little or no warning making it difficult to forecast beyond the current or next quarter. In the case of precious metal plating, customer purchase arrangements take into account the fluctuating price of precious metals.\n\ufeff\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in order volume, from one or more of these customers, could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\n\ufeff\nThe Company competes globally, with a large portion of its revenue derived from exports. Economic uncertainty or downturns in foreign markets could result in variability or have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\n\ufeff\nWhile some risks exist in foreign markets, the Company\u2019s customers have historically been based in stable regions. Approximately 40% of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from exports. To reduce the risks associated with foreign shipments and currency exchange fluctuations, the title to most of the products are transferred to the customers when shipped. The Company also has agreements with certain foreign customers to hold inventory at customer locations where revenue is recognized when the product is consumed by the customer. Payment for all product is required in U.S. Dollars. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. Dollar could affect the demand for the Company\u2019s products, or the timing of orders. This uncertainty could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\n\ufeff\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (the \u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal and its consequences may create global economic uncertainty, or disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U. This uncertainty may cause the Company\u2019s customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\n\ufeff\nAdverse developments in U.S. government trade policy and legislation, the imposition of tariffs or changes in diplomatic relations with countries in which our customers are located or conduct business may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulations and monetary, tax and trade policy, among other things. Potential changes in U.S. government trade policy and legislation, including changes to tax laws, withdrawal from or modification of international trade agreements, the imposition of additional tariffs on goods or other restrictions on trade and any changes in diplomatic relations with countries in which our customers are located or in which they conduct business may adversely affect our customers and, as a result, could materially affect our operating results.\n\ufeff\nQuarter to quarter variables, such as customer mix and profitability by product line, can be expected to result in fluctuations in quarterly results and make quarter to quarter comparisons difficult.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is a contract manufacturing organization providing components to a wide array of industries and supplying OEM\u2019s of various sizes up to and including Fortune 500 Companies. As a result of the diversity of components and the Company\u2019s reliance on large OEM\u2019s, who can change their demand with little or no notice, the Company will continue to see fluctuations in quarterly revenue and earnings, which could make quarter to quarter and year over year comparisons difficult.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s top five customers, covering all three products lines, comprised 51% of sales in both 2016 and 2015. As the Company continues to diversify its revenue base across all its product lines, the broader customer mix results in additional variables which can affect operating results, product mix, product line gross margins and customer ordering patterns.\n\ufeff\nIf the Company is unable to keep up with rapid technological changes, the processes or services it offers, or products it manufactures, may become obsolete or if the Company is no longer able to effectively manufacture, market and distribute these products, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe medical device industry is characterized by continual technological change. Although the Company attempts to expand technological capabilities in order to remain competitive, the Company may be unable to effectively develop and market competitive products, processes and services, or be able to meet the manufacturing needs related to new discoveries or developments by others, on a timely basis. This may make the Company\u2019s processes, products or services obsolete or uneconomical. Any substantial technological advance that eliminates one or more of the Company\u2019s product lines could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results. The Company generally does not receive purchase volume commitments extending beyond several months. Large corporations can shift focus away from a need for the Company\u2019s products and services with little or no warning. Additionally, should any of the Company\u2019s large OEM customers decide to vertically integrate the manufacturing of a product line, or chose to limit the number of qualified suppliers, the Company\u2019s operating results may be adversely impacted. If the Company cannot compete effectively in the marketplace, the Company's future prospects and financial results may be adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's dependence on large OEM customers, which can change demand on short notice, adds to the unpredictability of quarterly sales and earnings.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s large OEM customers are not required to have purchase volume commitments extending beyond several months and often lack dependable long-term forecasts. In addition, the Company\u2019s large OEM customers may change their demand schedule, either up or down, within a relatively short time horizon. Further, large OEM customers may choose to develop the capability of producing their own products. In addition, new customers may experience development delays, such as delays in FDA approvals, marketing delays in the development of sales channels or inadequate financing, any of which may delay the launch of new products and therefore may affect the timing of sales.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's quarterly results have in the past and can be expected in the future to vary due to changes in demand within a quarter from large OEM customers. These changes in demand may also result in the Company incurring additional working capital costs and increased manufacturing unit cost due to these short-term fluctuations. The expense levels and inventory, to a large extent, are based on shipment expectations in the quarter. If sales levels fall below these expectations, through a delay in orders or otherwise, operating results are likely to be adversely affected. An inability to accurately predict customer requirements makes cost-saving measures more difficult to implement.\n\ufeff\nAlthough the Company seeks to leverage its demonstrated product quality and expertise to expand its customer base and lessen its dependence on a few large customers, it can provide no assurance that it will be able to materially alter this dependency in the immediate future, if at all.\n\ufeff\nThe failure to repay or renew the Company's credit facility upon maturity or to comply with financial and other covenants contained therein, or to timely repay or refinance its subordinated debt, including as a result of events beyond the Company's control, could result in an event of default, which, if incurred, could materially and adversely affect operating results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's credit facility contains covenants that relate to various matters including debt and leverage ratios, further borrowings and security interests, merger or consolidation, acquisitions, guarantees, sales of assets other than inventory or obsolete equipment in the normal course of business, changes in management or ownership and payment of dividends. If there were an event of default under any of the debt instruments under the credit facility or the Company\u2019s subordinated debt that was not cured or waived, the holder of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to all debt owed to it to be due and payable immediately. The Company's ability to make payments on the indebtedness depends on the ability to generate cash. If the Company does not generate sufficient cash flow to meet the debt service and working capital requirements, it may need to seek additional financing. Failure to generate sufficient cash flow may result in a violation of financial covenants and default under the Company's debt agreements, cause the Company to default on its subordinated debt and make it more difficult to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable, or at all. Management cannot assure that the Company's assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under the outstanding debt instruments, either upon maturity or upon an event of default, or that the Company would be able to extend, refinance or restructure the payments on those debt instruments.\n\ufeff\nThe level of debt makes the Company more sensitive to the effects of economic downturns; the level of debt and provisions in the debt agreements could limit the Company's ability to react to changes in the economy or industry.\n\ufeff\nThe level of debt makes the Company more vulnerable to changes in the results of operations. The Company's level of debt could have other negative consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7\nLimiting the Company's ability to borrow money or sell stock for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nLimiting the Company's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in operations, business or the industries in which the Company competes; and\n\u00b7\nLeverage may place the Company at a competitive disadvantage by limiting its ability to invest in the business or in further research and development.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the Company's credit facility contains covenants that limit the flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the business and industry, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness, making investments, granting liens and merging or consolidating with other companies. Complying with these covenants may impair the Company's ability to finance the future operations or capital needs or to engage in other favorable business activities.\n\ufeff\nMedical devices are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of such products and failure to comply with such regulations may adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe medical device components the Company manufactures for its customers are subject to regulation by the FDA in the United States and other governmental authorities internationally. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming for the Company's customers and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Any such approvals may delay the Company's ability to commence production of a new or modified product. Under FDA regulations such products and the Company's manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the quality system and medical device reporting regulations and other requirements. If the Company fails to fully comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the Company or its customers may be subject to a range of sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls and the suspension of product manufacturing, monetary fines and criminal prosecution.\n\ufeff\nEconomic uncertainty, as well as impact of healthcare reform legislation, may reduce patient demand for knee or other joint replacement procedures. If there is not sufficient patient demand for the procedures for which orthopedic implant products are used, customer demand for the Company\u2019s orthopedic implant components and instruments would likely drop, and its business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\n\ufeff\nThe orthopedics industry in which the Company\u2019s customers operate is vulnerable to economic trends and the impact of healthcare reform legislation. If joint replacement procedures are deemed to be elective procedures, the cost of the procedure may not be fully covered by or reimbursable through government, including Medicare or Medicaid, or private health insurance. In times of economic uncertainty or recession, individuals may reduce the amount of money that they spend on deferrable medical procedures, including joint replacement procedures. Economic downturns in the United States and international markets could have an adverse effect on demand for the Company\u2019s orthopedic implant components and instruments. In addition, the Company\u2019s customers may be impacted by current or future executive orders and legislative actions impacting healthcare reform.\n\ufeff\nFailure to comply with Quality System Regulations or industry standards could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's Quality Management System complies with the requirements of ISO 13485:2003 and ISO 9001:2008. In addition the Company has registered its manufacturing facilities under ITAR and with the FDA. If the Company is not able to comply with the Company\u2019s Quality Management System or industry-defined standards, it may not be able to fill customer orders to the satisfaction of its customers. Failure to produce products compliant with these standards could lead to a loss of customers which would have an adverse impact on the Company's business and results of operations. Violations of the ITAR, FDA and other regulations may subject the Company to significant fines or penalties, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIf trade secrets are not kept confidential, the secrets may be used by others to compete against the Company.\n\ufeff\nThe Company relies on trade secrets to protect its proprietary processes and there are no assurances that others will not independently develop or acquire substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to the proprietary process. The meaningful protection of such proprietary technology cannot be guaranteed. The Company relies on confidentiality agreements with its employees. Remedies for any breach by a party to these confidentiality agreements may not be adequate to prevent such actions. Failure to maintain trade secret protection, for any reason, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is subject to stringent environmental regulations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local requirements governing the protection of the environment. These environmental regulations include those related to the use, storage, handling, discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous materials used in or resulting from the Company's manufacturing processes. Failure to comply with environmental laws could subject the Company to substantial liability or force the Company to significantly change its\nmanufacturing operations. In addition, under some of these laws and regulations, the Company could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if its properties are contaminated, even if it did not cause the contamination.\n\ufeff\nA product liability suit could adversely affect the Company's operating results.\n\ufeff\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of the customer's and Company's medical devices and/or components, including orthopedic implant components and instruments, as well as components for the military and law enforcement industry, entail the inherent risk of liability claims or product recalls. If the Company's customers are involved in a lawsuit, it is possible that the Company would also be named. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance, coverage may not be adequate. Product liability insurance is expensive, and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the Company may incur significant legal expenses and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation in the event of any such claim regardless of whether the Company is found to be liable. A successful product liability claim or product recall could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and ability to market the Company's products and services in the future.\n\ufeff\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock is volatile.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, volatile. A variety of events may cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to fluctuate significantly, including, but not limited to, quarter to quarter variations in operating results, adverse or positive news reports or public announcements and market conditions within the Company\u2019s industry. Due to the relatively small public float for the Company\u2019s common stock, trading of such shares may have a disproportionate effect on the stock price. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of stock, at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. Trading in the Company\u2019s stock or market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may seek to make acquisitions of companies, products or technologies that may disrupt the business and divert management\u2019s attention, cause the Company to incur additional costs, debt or issue equity securities and adversely impact its results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may seek to develop or make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies from time to time. Any acquisitions will require the assimilation of the operations, products and personnel of the acquired businesses and the training and motivation of these individuals. Further, such activities may divert management's attention and could result in an inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel of the acquired company, and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company. The Company also may have to, or choose to, incur additional costs, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions and its working capital needs. Such financing may not be available to the Company or may be on terms that involve covenants and financial ratios that may restrict the Company's ability to operate its business. The issuance of common stock, preferred stock or other equity securities in connection with an acquired business could be substantially dilutive to the stockholders\u2019 holdings. The Company cannot give any assurance that any such acquisitions will become profitable or remain so or will not have a material unfavorable impact on it. The Company is not currently party to any agreements, written or oral, for the acquisition of any company, product or technology.\n\ufeff\nThe Company could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist or hostile stockholders.\n\ufeff\nThe Company could be negatively affected as a result of shareholder activism, which could cause the Company to incur significant expense, hinder execution of its business strategy and impact the trading value of the Company\u2019s stock. Shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies in recent years. The Company is subject to the risks associated with such activism in light of the fact that a shareholder filed a Schedule 13D in November 2015 expressing an intent to engage in substantive discussions with management, the Board of Directors and others relating to the Company\u2019s operations, its management, strategy and other matters. Shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors, potentially interfering with the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plan. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to the Company\u2019s future direction, adversely affect its relationships with key executives, customers and other business partners, or make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, the Company has been, and may in the future be, required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect the Company and operating results.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may be exposed to potential risks relating to internal control over financial reporting.\n\ufeff\nAs required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports, including Form 10-K. In addition, if a reporting company is an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer (as defined by the Exchange Act), the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a reporting Company\u2019s financial statements must also attest to and report on\nthe reporting company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as well as the operating effectiveness of the reporting company\u2019s internal control. The Company was only subject to the management evaluation and review portion of these requirements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of SOX on an ongoing, timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of the Company\u2019s financial statements, which in turn could harm the Company\u2019s business and negatively impact the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm the Company\u2019s operating results or cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations.\n\ufeff\nFailure to comply with the listing requirements of the NYSE MKT could lead to the commencement of delisting proceedings in accordance the NYSE MKT\u2019s Company Guide. Delisting could limit investors' ability to effect transactions in the Company's securities and subject the stock to additional trading restrictions.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, a national securities exchange. To maintain such listing, the Company is required to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE MKT as set forth in its Company Guide. If the Company is unable to maintain the listing of its stock on the NYSE MKT or another exchange for failure to comply with the continued listing requirements, including timely filing of Exchange Act reports and compliance with the NYSE MKT\u2019s corporate governance requirements, the Company and its security holders could face significant material adverse consequences including a limited availability of market quotations for its stock and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 76544, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "MICR"}
