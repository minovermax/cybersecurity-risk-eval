RISK FACTORS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which are based on our beliefs and expectations as to future outcomes, include, among others, statements relating to the following:\n\u2022 Expectations of revenues, expenses, profitability, and cash flows, including our expectation that Orenitram\u00ae (treprostinil) Extended Release Tablets (Orenitram) cost of product sales as a percentage of its net revenue will become comparable to our other treprostinil-based products;\n\u2022 The sufficiency of current and future working capital to support operations;\n\u2022 Our ability to obtain financing;\n\u2022 Our expectations that we will pay the full principal balance due on the converting Convertible Notes upon settlement of early conversions or upon its maturity and that we have sufficient financial resources available to pay all amounts due;\n\u2022 The value of our common stock and our ability and plans to complete our current common stock repurchase program;\n\u2022 The maintenance of domestic and international regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 The expected volume and timing of sales of our existing commercial products-Remodulin\u00ae (treprostinil) Injection (Remodulin), Tyvaso\u00ae (treprostinil) Inhalation Solution (Tyvaso),\nOrenitram and Adcirca\u00ae (tadalafil) Tablets (Adcirca)-and potential future commercial products such as ch14.18, our antiviral drugs and esuberaprost;\n\u2022 The timing and outcome of clinical studies, regulatory filings, product launches and sales, including: (1) our plans to complete our FREEDOM-EV study of Orenitram; (2) our aim to obtain United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Orenitram as a combination therapy; (3) our plan to file for approval of Orenitram in Europe upon the successful completion of the FREEDOM-EV study; (4) our program with Medtronic, Inc. (Medtronic) to develop an implantable pump to administer intravenous Remodulin; (5) the outcome of our FDA biologics license application and European Medicines Agency (EMA) marketing authorization application for ch14.18; (6) our phase III clinical trial of esuberaprost in combination with Tyvaso; and (7) our collaboration with DEKA Research & Development Corp. to develop a pre-filled, semi-disposable pump system for subcutaneous Remodulin.\n\u2022 The outcome of potential future regulatory actions, including audits and inspections, by the FDA and international regulatory agencies;\n\u2022 The impact of competing therapies, including generic products (such as generic sildenafil) and newly-developed therapies (such as selexipag, also known as Uptravi\u00ae), on sales of our commercial products;\n\u2022 The expectation that we will be able to produce sufficient quantities and maintain adequate inventories of our commercial products, through both our in-house production capabilities and third-party production sites, and our ability to obtain and maintain related approvals by the FDA and other regulatory agencies;\n\u2022 The adequacy of our intellectual property protections and the validity and expiration dates of the patents we own or license;\n\u2022 Our expectations regarding our ability to defend our intellectual property relating to Remodulin against generic and other challenges, including but not limited to our ongoing litigation with Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz) and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva);\n\u2022 Our expectations regarding the subpoena by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services relating to Remodulin, Tyvaso and Adcirca, including our marketing practices relating to these products, and the related investigation by the United States Department of Justice;\n\u2022 Any statements that include the words \"believe,\" \"seek,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"estimate,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"plan,\" or similar expressions; and\n\u2022 Other statements contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts.\nThe statements identified as forward-looking statements may appear in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from anticipated results. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe rely heavily on sales of Remodulin, Tyvaso and Adcirca to generate revenues and support our operations.\nSales of Remodulin, Tyvaso and Adcirca comprise substantially all of our revenues. A wide variety of events, many of which are described in other risk factors below, could cause sales of these products to decline. For instance, we would be unable to sell any of these products if their regulatory approvals were withdrawn. Any substantial change in the prescribing practices or dosing patterns of patients using Remodulin, Tyvaso or Adcirca due to combination or competing therapies, side effects, adverse events, deaths or any other reasons could decrease related revenues. We also face potential generic competition. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2012, generic sildenafil became commercially available, which could negatively affect future demand for Adcirca. We are also defending our intellectual property related to Remodulin against generic challenges by Sandoz and Teva. In addition, we rely on third parties to produce, market, distribute and sell Remodulin, Tyvaso and Adcirca. The inability of any one of these third parties to perform these functions satisfactorily could result in a reduction in sales. In addition, any failure to effectively manage our internal production processes could result in an inability to meet patient demand. Because we are highly dependent on sales of Remodulin, Tyvaso and Adcirca, a reduction in sales of any one of these products could have a negative and material adverse impact on our operations.\nIf our products fail in clinical trials, we will be unable to obtain or maintain FDA and international regulatory approvals and will be unable to sell those products.\nTo obtain regulatory approvals from the FDA and international regulatory agencies such as the EMA, we must conduct clinical trials demonstrating that our products are safe and effective. In the past, several of our product candidates failed or were discontinued at various stages in the development process. Moreover, we may need to amend ongoing trials or the FDA and/or international regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional trials beyond those we planned. Such occurrences could result in significant delays and additional costs, and related clinical trials may be unsuccessful. Approval of a new drug application or biologics license application could be subject to delays if the FDA determines that it cannot review or approve the application as submitted. In such a case, the FDA would issue a refuse-to-file letter or a complete response letter outlining deficiencies in the submission, and the FDA may require substantial additional studies, testing or information in order to complete its review of the application. We may fail to address any of these deficiencies adequately and consequently would be unable to obtain FDA approval to market the product candidate.\nIn addition, we are enrolling a phase IV clinical trial called FREEDOM-EV, which is a study of Orenitram in combination with other approved pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapies. One primary endpoint of the study is time to clinical worsening. The primary endpoint of our phase III study of esuberaprost in combination with Tyvaso is also time to clinical worsening. We have not previously conducted a study with a time to clinical worsening primary endpoint. Our inexperience with this type of trial design may impact our ability to conduct these trials appropriately and achieve positive results, or complete the trials within our anticipated timetable. In particular, failure to prove the efficacy of Orenitram in combination with other PAH therapies could materially limit the commercial potential of Orenitram and impede our growth.\nThe length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for marketing varies by product, product use and country. Furthermore, we cannot predict with certainty the length of time it will take to complete necessary clinical trials or obtain regulatory approval of our future products.\nOur clinical trials may be discontinued, delayed or disqualified for various reasons. These reasons include:\n\u2022 The drug is ineffective, or physicians and/or patients believe that the drug is ineffective;\n\u2022 We fail to reach agreement with the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory agencies regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 Patients do not enroll in our studies at the rate we expect;\n\u2022 We are unable to obtain approval from institutional review boards to conduct clinical trials at their respective sites;\n\u2022 Ongoing or new clinical trials conducted by drug companies in addition to our own clinical trials reduce the availability of patients for our trials;\n\u2022 Other investigational or approved therapies are viewed as more effective or convenient by physicians or patients;\n\u2022 Our clinical trial sites, contracted clinical trial administrators or clinical studies conducted entirely by third parties do not adhere to trial protocols and required quality controls under FDA good clinical practice (GCP) regulations and similar regulations outside the United States;\n\u2022 Patients experience severe side effects during treatment or die during our trials because of adverse events related to the trial drug, advanced disease, or other medical complications; and\n\u2022 The results of our clinical trials conducted in countries outside of the United States are not acceptable to the United States or other countries, and the results of our clinical trials conducted in the United States are not acceptable to regulators in other countries.\nIn addition, the FDA and its international counterparts have substantial discretion over the approval process for pharmaceutical products. As such, these regulatory agencies may not agree that we have demonstrated the requisite level of product safety and efficacy to grant approval.\nWe may not compete successfully with established and newly developed drugs or products, or the companies that develop and market them.\nWe compete with well-established drug companies for, among other things, funding, licenses, expertise, personnel, clinical trial patients and investigators, consultants and third-party collaborators. We also compete with these companies for market share. Most of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, sales, distribution and technical resources, and a larger number of approved products, than we do. These competitors also possess greater experience in areas critical to success such as research and development, clinical trials, sales and marketing and regulatory matters. There are several treatments that compete with our commercial therapies, as well as several other therapies under development, such as Actelion's Uptravi (selexipag) drug candidate, which is an oral prostacyclin IP receptor agonist. For the treatment of PAH, we compete with a number of approved products in the United States and worldwide, including the following: Flolan\u00ae, Ventavis\u00ae, Ilomedin \u00ae, Tracleer\u00ae, Revatio\u00ae, Letairis \u00ae, Veletri\u00ae, Adempas\u00ae, Opsumit \u00ae, generic epoprostenol and generic sildenafil citrate. Patients and doctors may perceive these competing products, or products developed in the future, as safer, more effective, more convenient and/or less expensive than our therapies. Alternatively, doctors may reduce the prescribed doses of our products if they prescribe them in combination with our competitors' products. In addition, many competing PAH therapies are less invasive than Remodulin and the use of these products may delay or prevent initiation of Remodulin therapy. Any of these circumstances could negatively impact our operating results.\nDevelopment of new products or technologies by others may make our products obsolete or seemingly inferior.\nOther companies may introduce new products that may render all or some of our technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive. For example, both Adempas and Opsumit were recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of PAH. Our commercial therapies may also have to compete with investigational products currently in development, including Uptravi, which was submitted by Actelion in December 2014 to the FDA and EMA for approval to treat PAH. In addition, alternative approaches to treating chronic diseases, such as gene therapy or cell therapy, may make our products obsolete or noncompetitive. If introduced into the market, investigational therapies for PAH could be used in combination with, or as a substitute for, our therapies. If this occurs, doctors may reduce or discontinue the use of our products for their patients.\nSales of our products are subject to reimbursement from government agencies and other third parties. Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures may negatively impact our sales.\nThe commercial success of our products depends, in part, on the availability of reimbursements by governmental payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private insurance companies. An estimated 35-50% of Remodulin, Tyvaso and Adcirca sales in the United States are reimbursed under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our products such as China and Japan, government payers and/or third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medicinal products and frequently challenge the pricing of new and expensive drugs. Our prostacyclin analogue products (Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram) are expensive therapies. Consequently, it may be difficult for our distributors to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payers to motivate such distributors to support our products. Alternatively, third-party payers may reduce the amount of reimbursement for our products based on changes in pricing of other therapies for PAH. If third-party payers do not approve our products for reimbursement, or limit reimbursements, patients and physicians could choose competing products that are approved for reimbursement or provide lower out-of-pocket costs.\nIn the United States, the federal government and others are increasingly focused on analyzing the impact of various regulatory programs on the federal deficit, which could result in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs. In addition, financial pressures may cause the federal government or other third-party payers to seek cost containment more aggressively through mandatory discounts or rebates on our products, policies requiring the automatic substitution of generic products, more rigorous requirements for initial reimbursement approvals for new products or other similar measures. For example, there have been proposals to reduce reimbursement rates and/or adopt mandatory rebates under Medicare Part B, which covers Remodulin and Tyvaso. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from government health care programs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations.\nIn Europe, the success of our commercial products and future products depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement at acceptable levels. In many European countries, patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. Countries in Europe are under increasing pressure to reduce the cost of health care. Changes to current reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to sell our products or sell our products on a profitable basis. In many markets outside the United States, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals through the implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes and profit control. Furthermore, international governments expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as prescription volumes increase. In addition, in December 2011, we received marketing approval for the intravenous use of Remodulin in most of the countries that are members of the European Economic Area (EEA); however, we are in the process of obtaining approval of our risk management plan on a country-by-country basis, and must\nobtain pricing approval in each of these member countries before we can market Remodulin. Delays in obtaining these approvals, or failure to obtain satisfactory pricing approvals, could impact our future sales growth. Additionally, in granting pricing approval for the intravenous use of Remodulin, a member country may approve a lower reimbursement price for intravenous Remodulin than for subcutaneous Remodulin, or reduce the reimbursement price for both methods of administering Remodulin. Any regulatory action reducing the reimbursement rates for intravenous and subcutaneous Remodulin could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and our business.\nOur production strategy exposes us to significant risks.\nWe must be able to produce sufficient quantities of our commercial products to satisfy the growing demand for our products. We produce Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram, including the active ingredient in each of these products, at our own facilities and rely on third parties for additional production capacity and to produce advanced pharmaceutical ingredients. We rely on Minnetronix, Inc. as the sole manufacturer of the Tyvaso Inhalation System, and on Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) as the sole manufacturer of Adcirca.\nWe substantially rely on third parties to adhere to and maintain production processes in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. If any of these critical third-party production and supply arrangements are interrupted for compliance issues or other reasons, we may not have sufficient inventory to meet future demand. In addition, any change in suppliers and/or service providers could interrupt the production of our commercial products and impede the progress of our commercial launch plans and clinical trials.\nIn addition, our internal production process also subjects us to risks as we engage in increasingly complex production processes. For example, Remodulin, Tyvaso and ch14.18 must be formulated in a sterile environment, which is challenging to maintain on a commercial scale. In addition, ch14.18 is a monoclonal antibody. As with all biologic products, monoclonal antibodies are inherently more difficult to produce than our treprostinil-based products and involve increased risk of viral and other contaminants. Finally, we have limited experience producing Orenitram on a commercial scale, and currently all Orenitram production is performed at our own facilities. It could take substantial time to establish an FDA-approved contract manufacturer as an additional supplier of Orenitram, or this process may not be successful at all.\nAdditional risks we face with our production strategy include the following:\n\u2022 We and our third-party producers are subject to the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices and similar international regulatory standards. We are limited in our ability to exercise control over regulatory compliance by our third-party producers;\n\u2022 As we expand our production operations to include new elements of the production process or new products, we may experience difficulty designing and implementing processes and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations;\n\u2022 Even if we and our third-party producers are in compliance with applicable domestic and international drug production regulations, the sterility and quality of the products being produced could be substandard and, therefore, such products would be unavailable for sale or use or subject to recalls;\n\u2022 If we had to replace our own production operations or a third-party producer, the FDA and its international counterparts would require new testing and compliance inspections. Furthermore, a new producer would have to be familiarized with the processes necessary to produce and commercially validate our products, as producing our treprostinil-based and biologic products is complex;\n\u2022 We may be unable to contract with needed producers on satisfactory terms or at all; and\n\u2022 The supply of materials and components necessary to produce and package our products may become scarce or unavailable. Disruptions to the supply of these materials could delay the production and subsequent sale of such products. Any products produced with substituted materials or components would be subject to approval from the FDA and international regulatory agencies before they could be sold. The timing of any such regulatory approval is difficult to predict.\nAny of these factors could disrupt sales of our commercial products, delay clinical trials or commercialization of new products, result in product liability claims and product recalls, and entail higher costs. Interruptions in our production process could be significant given the length of time and complexity involved in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for alternative arrangements, through either third parties or internal manufacturing processes.\nWe rely in part on third parties to perform activities that are critical to our business. Our ability to generate commercial sales or conduct clinical trials could suffer if our third-party suppliers and service providers fail to perform.\nThird parties assist us in: (1) producing our commercial products; (2) conducting clinical trials, preclinical studies and other research and development activities; (3) obtaining regulatory approvals; (4) conducting pharmacovigilance-related and product complaint activities, including drug safety, reporting adverse events and product complaints; and (5) marketing and distributing our products. The involvement of third parties is necessary because we do not possess the internal capacity, and in certain cases the expertise, to perform all of these functions. Accordingly, the success of these third parties in performing their contractual obligations is critical to our operations.\nFor risks relating to the involvement of third parties in our production process, see the risk factor above, entitled Our production strategy exposes us to significant risks.\nWe rely on Accredo Health Group, Inc. (Accredo) and CVS Health Corporation (CVS) to distribute and sell Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram in the United States. These distributors are also partially responsible for negotiating reimbursements from third-party payers for the cost of our therapies. From time-to-time, we increase the price of products sold to our U.S.-based and international distributors. Our price increases may not be fully reimbursed by third-party payers. If our distributors do not achieve acceptable profit margins on our products, they may reduce or discontinue the sale of our products. Furthermore, if our distributors devote fewer resources to sell our products or are unsuccessful in their sales efforts, our revenues may decline materially. Outside the U.S. we are substantially reliant on our international distributors to maintain regulatory approvals for our products and to market and sell our products in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nWe rely on Lilly to manufacture and supply Adcirca for us, and we use Lilly's pharmaceutical wholesaler network to distribute Adcirca in the United States and Puerto Rico. If Lilly is unable to manufacture or supply Adcirca or its distribution network is disrupted, it could delay, disrupt or prevent us from selling Adcirca, which would slow the growth of our business. In addition, Lilly has the right to determine the wholesale price of Adcirca, which generally moves in parity with the wholesale price Lilly sets for Cialis\u00ae (both of these products contain the same active ingredient). Changes in Lilly's wholesale prices could adversely impact demand or reimbursement for Adcirca, particularly in light of the commercial availability of generic sildenafil, the active ingredient in Revatio, which could be prescribed in lieu of Adcirca.\nIn addition, any change in service providers could interrupt the distribution of our commercial products and our other products and services, and impede the progress of our clinical trials, commercial launch plans and related revenues.\nWe rely heavily on third-party contract research organizations, contract laboratories, clinical investigative sites and other third-parties to conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other research and development activities. In addition, the success of certain products we are developing will depend on clinical trials sponsored by third parties. Failure by any third party to conduct or assist us in conducting clinical trials in accordance with study protocols, quality controls and GCP, or other applicable U.S. or international requirements or to submit associated regulatory filings, could limit or prevent our ability to rely on results of those trials in seeking regulatory approvals.\nWe rely heavily on Medtronic for the success of our program to develop an implantable pump to deliver intravenous Remodulin (the Remodulin Implantable System). Medtronic has completed a clinical study in this regard, and submitted a premarket approval application (PMA) seeking FDA approval for the Remodulin Implantable System. We rely on Medtronic to respond to FDA requests for additional information with respect to its PMA, and following approval we will rely on Medtronic to manufacture the Remodulin Implantable System and to maintain appropriate quality controls relating to the system. As such, we can provide no assurances as to the timing or likelihood of the Remodulin implantable pump program's success.\nWe are reliant on third parties to supply pumps and other supplies necessary to deliver Remodulin. There are a limited number of pumps available in the market, and the discontinuation of any particular pump could have a material, adverse impact on our Remodulin revenues.\nOur operations must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the United States and other countries, including FDA regulations. Failure to obtain approvals on a timely basis or to achieve continued compliance could delay, disrupt or prevent the commercialization of our products.\nThe products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory agencies and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation. Our research and development efforts must comply with extensive regulations, including those promulgated by the FDA and the United States Department of Agriculture. The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The regulatory approval process is particularly uncertain for our lung transplantation programs, which include the development of xenotransplantation, regenerative medicine and cell-based products. The manufacture, distribution, advertising and marketing of our products are also subject to extensive regulation, including strict pharmacovigilance and adverse event and medical device reporting requirements. Any future product approvals we receive could be accompanied by significant restrictions on the use or marketing of a given product. Furthermore, our product candidates may fail to receive marketing approval on a timely basis, or at all. If granted, product approvals can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, such as post-marketing requirements and post-marketing commitments, or upon the occurrence of adverse events subsequent to commercial introduction.\nDiscovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing, regulatory, compliance, research and development, pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting, marketing or sales activities could result in regulatory restrictions on our products up to and including withdrawal of our products from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could be subject to penalties that may consist of fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of our products and/or criminal prosecution. In addition, our reputation could be harmed as a result of any such regulatory restrictions or actions, and patients and physicians may avoid the use of our products even after we have resolved the issues that led to such regulatory action.\nFor example, in December 2013 we received a subpoena from the OIG in connection with a civil investigation by the United States Department of Justice, principally represented by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland. The subpoena requests documents regarding Remodulin,\nTyvaso and Adcirca, including our marketing practices relating to these products. We are cooperating with the investigation, which has and will continue to increase our legal expenses, and will require significant management time and attention. We are not aware that a claim, litigation or assessment has been asserted in connection with the subpoena. However, such subpoenas are often associated with previously filed qui tam actions brought under the federal and state false claims acts. Qui tam actions are lawsuits brought by private plaintiffs on behalf of the federal government, and often state governments, for alleged federal or state false claims act violations, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties, currently set at $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim. We may currently be subject to investigation in connection with qui tam actions filed under seal. We also cannot predict what actions, if any, may be taken against us or our employees by the OIG, the Department of Justice, other governmental entities, or any third parties in connection with such investigation, nor can we predict or determine the outcome of the government's investigation or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of fines, damages, restitutions or penalties that might result from a settlement or an adverse outcome. As a result of the investigation we may also be subject to exclusion of our products from reimbursement under the federal healthcare programs, debarment, or a corporate integrity agreement, and certain of our employees may also be subject to exclusion or debarment. Any of these risks and uncertainties, including the conduct of the investigation itself, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are subject to ongoing regulatory review of our currently marketed products.\nAfter our products receive regulatory approval, they remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, which can impact, among other things, product labeling, manufacturing practices, pharmacovigilance and adverse event and medical device reporting, complaint processing, storage, distribution, advertising and promotion, and record keeping. If we do not comply with applicable regulations, the range of possible sanctions may include: (1) adverse publicity, (2) product recalls or seizures, (3) fines, (4) total or partial suspensions of production and/or distribution, (5) suspension of marketing applications, and (6) enforcement actions, including injunctions and civil suits or criminal prosecution. Further, the FDA often requires post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. The FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies may condition approval of our product candidates on the completion of such post-marketing clinical studies. These post-marketing studies may suggest that a product causes undesirable side effects or may present a risk to the patient. If data we collect from post-marketing studies suggest that one of our approved products may present an unacceptable safety risk, regulatory authorities could withdraw the product's approval, suspend production or place other marketing restrictions on that product. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is delayed or withdrawn, our operating results and the value of our company may be adversely affected.\nRegulatory approval for our currently marketed products is limited by the FDA and other regulators to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\nAny regulatory approval of our products is limited to specific diseases and indications for which our products have been deemed safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced.\nWhile physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and for uses that differ from those approved by regulatory authorities (called \"off-label\" uses), our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. Although U.S. regulatory authorities generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians, they do restrict communications by companies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail\nto comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising can result in the FDA's refusal to approve a product, suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, product recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, civil lawsuits, injunctions or criminal prosecution.\nWe must comply with various laws in jurisdictions around the world that restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Failure to comply with such laws could result in penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are various laws in jurisdictions around the world that restrict particular marketing practices in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims statutes, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. Our business activities may be subject to challenge under these laws, and any penalties imposed upon us could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, we have significantly expanded our sales and marketing staff. Any expansion of sales and marketing efforts can increase the risks of noncompliance with these laws. Finally, the growth in our operations outside the United States, both directly and through third-party distributors, also has increased these risks.\nIn the United States, the federal health care program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other activities, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving compensation to induce, or in return for, the purchase, lease, order or arranging the purchase, lease or order of any health care product or service reimbursable under any federally financed health-care program. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. The exemptions and safe harbors for this statute are narrow, and practices that involve compensation intended to induce prescriptions, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not always meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim or knowingly making or causing a false statement material to a false claim. Several pharmaceutical and health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the free product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of these companies' marketing of a product for unapproved and non-reimbursable uses. Potential liability under the federal False Claims Act includes mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties, currently set at $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs; furthermore, in several states, these statutes and regulations apply regardless of the payer. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's product from reimbursement under government programs, debarment, criminal fines, and imprisonment.\nIn December 2013 we received a subpoena from the OIG reflecting a civil investigation by the United States Department of Justice, principally represented by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland. The subpoena requests documents regarding Remodulin, Tyvaso and Adcirca, including our marketing practices relating to these products. For further details, see Part I, Item 3.-Legal Proceedings.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PPACA), also imposed new reporting requirements for pharmaceutical, biologic and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to\nphysicians and teaching hospitals. In addition, pharmaceutical, biologic and device manufacturers, with certain exceptions, are required to report and disclose investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to $150,000 per year (and up to $1.0 million per year for \"knowing failures\") for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission.\nFurther, the PPACA amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. This amendment provides that a person or entity no longer needs to have knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nIf not preempted by this federal law, several states currently require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in those states. Depending on the state, legislation may prohibit various other marketing related activities, or require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, certain states, such as California, Nevada, Connecticut and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and several other states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws will face civil penalties.\nGovernment health care reform could increase our costs, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results. The PPACA is a broad measure intended to expand health care coverage within the United States, primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. The reforms imposed by the law will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry; however, the full effects of the PPACA will be unknown until all of these provisions are implemented and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental health care programs that could significantly impact the success of our products or product candidates.\nReports of actual or perceived side effects and adverse events associated with our products, such as sepsis, could cause physicians and patients to avoid or discontinue use of our products in favor of alternative treatments.\nReports of side effects and adverse events associated with our products could have a significant adverse impact on the sale of our products. An example of a known risk associated with intravenous Remodulin is sepsis, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection of the bloodstream caused by a wide variety of bacteria. Intravenous prostacyclin analogues, such as intravenous Remodulin, are infused continuously through a catheter placed in a large vein in the patient's chest, and sepsis is a known risk associated with this type of delivery. As a result, sepsis is included as a risk in the Remodulin package insert, and the occurrence of sepsis is familiar to physicians who prescribe intravenously administered therapies. Concerns about bloodstream infections may affect a physician's decision to prescribe or a patient's willingness to use intravenous Remodulin.\nNegative attention from special interest groups may impair our business.\nAs is common with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, our early-stage research and development involves animal testing, which we conduct both directly and through contracts with third\nparties. Notwithstanding the vital role of animal research in the drug discovery and development process, certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for research purposes. Historically, our research and development activities have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention. However, research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention, generally including demonstrations near facilities operated by other companies in our industry. Any negative attention, threats or acts of vandalism directed against our animal research activities in the future could impede the operation of our business.\nIf any of the license or other agreements under which intellectual property rights are licensed to, or were acquired by us, are breached or terminated, our right to continue to develop, produce and sell the products covered by such agreements could be impaired or lost.\nOur business depends upon our continuing ability to exploit our intellectual property rights in the drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others and those which we have commercialized and are developing further. These intellectual property rights have either been licensed to us or have been acquired by us. Under each of our product license agreements, we are granted a license to intellectual property owned by others that covers a drug or other product. Under each of our purchase agreements, we have rights to certain intellectual property. We may be required to license other intellectual property owned by third parties to continue to develop and commercialize our products.\nThis dependence on intellectual property developed by others involves the following risks:\n\u2022 We may be unable to obtain rights to intellectual property that we determine we need for our business at a reasonable cost or at all;\n\u2022 If any of our product licenses or purchase agreements are terminated, we may lose our rights to develop, make and sell the products to which such licenses or agreements relate;\n\u2022 Our license and purchase agreements generally provide the licensor or seller with the right to terminate the agreement in the event of a breach; for example, if we fail to pay royalties and other fees timely and do not cure the failure within a stated time period; and\n\u2022 If a licensor of intellectual property that we have rights to breaches its obligation or otherwise fails to maintain the intellectual property licensed, we may lose any ability to prevent others from developing or marketing similar products that are covered by such intellectual property. In addition, we may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain the intellectual property ourselves or take legal action seeking to force the licensor to do so.\nCertain agreements under which we acquired or licensed intellectual property rights may restrict our ability to develop related products in certain countries or for particular diseases and may impose other restrictions that affect our ability to develop and market related products in the most effective manner.\nWhen we acquire or license intellectual property rights to drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others, these rights are frequently limited. For instance, our rights to market Adcirca are geographically limited to the United States and Puerto Rico. Furthermore, we cannot undertake any additional investigational work with respect to Adcirca in other indications of pulmonary hypertension without Lilly's prior approval. Provisions in our license and purchase agreements may impose other restrictions that affect our ability to develop and market products to which the intellectual property relates. For example, Lilly also has authority over all regulatory activities and has the right to determine the net wholesale price for Adcirca.\nOur intellectual property rights may not effectively deter competitors from developing competing products that, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits.\nThe period under which our commercial and developmental therapies are protected by our patent rights is limited. Three of our U.S. patents covering our current methods of synthesizing and producing treprostinil expire in October 2017, and a fourth will expire in 2028. We also have been granted one patent in the European Union and one patent in Japan, each of which covers our treprostinil synthesis and production methods and will expire in October 2018. Our three U.S. patents covering an improved diluent for Remodulin will expire in 2028 and 2029. Our patents for Tyvaso covering methods of treating PAH by inhaled delivery will expire in the United States and in various countries throughout the world in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Our patents for Orenitram covering methods of use for treating PAH, orally administered formulations, controlled moisture storage and production methods and controlled release formulations will expire in the United States between 2024 and 2031 and in various countries throughout the world in 2024. The U.S. patent for Adcirca for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension will expire in November 2017.\nWe continue to conduct research into new methods to synthesize treprostinil and have pending U.S. and international patent applications and patents relating to such methods. However, we cannot be sure that these additional patents will effectively deter or delay competitors' efforts to bring new products to market, or that additional patent applications will result in new patents. Upon the expiration of any of our patents, competitors may develop generic versions of our products and may market those generic versions at a lower price to compete with our products. Competitors may also seek to design around our patents prior to their expiration in an effort to develop competing products that do not infringe our patents. Prior to the expiration of our patents, third parties may challenge the validity of our patents, through patent litigation, proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other applicable patent filing office, or other means.\nThe scope of any patent we hold may not deter competitors from developing a product that competes with the product we sell that is covered by the patent. Patent laws of foreign jurisdictions may not protect our patent rights to the same extent as the patent laws of the United States. In addition, we may be forced to incur substantial costs to defend the intellectual property rights conferred by our patents. Furthermore, our suppliers who have granted us exclusive rights may have inadequate intellectual property protections. Competitors also may attempt to invalidate our existing patents before they expire.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and other technological advances that we do not disclose to the public. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and others to whom we disclose trade secrets and other confidential information. These agreements may not necessarily prevent our trade secrets from being used or disclosed without our authorization and confidentiality agreements may be difficult, time-consuming and expensive to enforce or may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. In addition, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such third party, or those to whom they communicate such technology or information, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nThe validity, enforceability and scope of certain of our patents covering Remodulin are currently being challenged as a result of abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filings by two generic drug companies. The outcome of current or future challenges with respect to the validity, enforceability or scope of our patents could significantly reduce revenues from Remodulin.\nBoth Sandoz and Teva have filed ANDAs seeking FDA approval to market generic versions of Remodulin. We have filed lawsuits against Sandoz and Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging patent infringement. For details on the status of these proceedings, please see Part I, Item 3.-Legal Proceedings, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere can be no assurance that we will prevail in our defense of our patent rights, or that additional challenges from other ANDA filers will not surface with respect to Remodulin or our other treprostinil-based products. Our existing patents could be invalidated, found unenforceable or found not to cover one or more generic forms of Remodulin, Tyvaso or Orenitram. If any ANDA filer were to receive approval to sell a generic version of Remodulin, Tyvaso or Orenitram and/or prevail in any patent litigation, the affected product would become subject to increased competition and our revenue would decrease.\nThird parties may allege that our patents are invalid, or that our products or services infringe their patents and other intellectual property rights, which could result in the payment of royalties. Payment of royalties would negatively affect our profits; furthermore, if we chose to contest these allegations, we could be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation or could lose the ability to continue to sell the related products.\nThird parties may seek to invalidate or otherwise challenge our patents, through patent litigation and/or initiating proceedings, including re-examinations, inter partes reviews, post-grant reviews and interference proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We may initiate litigation to enforce or defend our patents or intellectual property rights; however, litigation can be time consuming, distracting to our operations, costly and may conclude unfavorably for us. In addition, the outcome of patent infringement litigation often is difficult to predict. If we are unsuccessful with respect to any future legal action in the defense of our patents and our patents are invalidated or determined to be unenforceable, our business could be negatively impacted. Even if our patents are determined to be valid or enforceable, it is possible that a competitor could circumvent our patents by effectively designing around the claims of our patents. Accordingly, our patents may not provide us with any competitive advantage.\nTo the extent third-party patents to which we currently do not hold licenses are necessary for us to manufacture, use or sell our products, we would need to obtain necessary licenses to prevent infringement. In the case of products or services that utilize intellectual property of strategic collaborators or other suppliers, such suppliers may have an obligation to secure the needed license to these patents at their cost. Otherwise, we would be responsible for the cost of these licenses. Royalty payments and other fees under these licenses would erode our profits from the sale of related products and services. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to alter the design of the product to avoid infringing a third-party patent, we would be unable to continue to manufacture or sell related products.\nIf a third party commences legal action against us for infringement, or institutes proceedings challenging the validity of our patents, we could be compelled to incur significant costs to defend the action and our management's attention could be diverted, whether or not the action were to have any merit. We cannot be certain that we could prevail in the action, and an adverse judgment or settlement resulting from the action could require us to pay substantial amounts in damages for infringement or substantial amounts to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claim.\nWe may not maintain adequate insurance coverage to protect us against significant product liability claims.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of drugs and diagnostics involve product liability risks. We may not be able to maintain our current product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be adequate for all potential claims. If claims or losses significantly exceed our liability insurance coverage, we may experience financial hardship or potentially be forced out of business.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and qualified scientific and technical personnel, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives.\nMembers of our management team, including our founder, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Martine Rothblatt, and our President and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Roger Jeffs, play a critical role in defining our business strategy and maintaining our corporate culture. The loss of the services and leadership of Dr. Rothblatt, Dr. Jeffs or any other members of our senior management team could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain key person life insurance on our senior management team members. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to identify and retain adequate replacements for members of our senior management team and to transfer knowledge effectively could impede the achievement of our business objectives. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel. Competition for skilled scientific and technical personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense. Furthermore, our compensation arrangements may not be sufficient to attract new qualified scientific and technical employees or retain such core employees. If we fail to attract and retain such employees, we may not be successful in developing and commercializing new therapies for PAH and other diseases.\nImproper handling of hazardous materials used in our activities could expose us to significant remediation liabilities.\nOur research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals and hazardous substances and we are expanding these activities in both scale and location. In addition, patients may dispose of our products using means we do not control. Such activities subject us to numerous federal, state, and local environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations can require significant costs; furthermore, we can be subject to substantial fines and penalties in the event of noncompliance. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. Furthermore, once chemical and hazardous materials leave our facilities, we cannot control the manner in which such hazardous waste is disposed of by our contractors. In the event of an accident, we could be liable for substantial civil damages or costs associated with the cleanup of the release of hazardous materials. Any related liability could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may encounter substantial difficulties managing our growth relative to product demand.\nWe have spent considerable resources building and expanding our offices, laboratories and production facilities, and we are currently seeking regulatory approvals for certain facilities. However, our facilities could be insufficient to meet future demand for our products. Conversely, we may have excess capacity at our facilities if future demand falls short of our projections, or if we do not receive regulatory approvals for the products we intend to produce at our facilities. Constructing our facilities is expensive and our ability to satisfactorily recover our investment will depend on sales of the products manufactured at these facilities in sufficient volume. If we do experience substantial sales growth, we may have difficulty managing inventory levels as marketing new therapies is complicated and gauging future demand can be difficult and uncertain until we possess sufficient post-launch sales experience.\nIf we need additional financing and cannot obtain it, our product development and sales efforts may be limited.\nWe may be required to seek additional sources of financing to meet unplanned or planned expenditures. Unplanned expenditures could be significant and may result from necessary modifications to product development plans or product offerings in response to difficulties encountered with clinical trials. We may also face unexpected costs in preparing products for commercial sale, or in maintaining sales levels of our currently marketed therapeutic products. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may be compelled to delay clinical studies, curtail operations or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets.\nWe may require additional financing to meet significant future obligations. For instance, upon maturity or conversion of our 1.0 percent Convertible Senior Notes due September 15, 2016 (Convertible Notes), subject to certain provisions, we must repay our investors in cash up to the remaining principal balance of $138.8 million. Further, in certain circumstances constituting a fundamental change under the Convertible Notes, we may be required to repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash.\nAwards granted under our Share Tracking Award Plans (which we collectively refer to as the STAP) entitle participants to receive in cash an amount equal to the appreciation in the price of our common stock, which is calculated as the positive difference between the closing price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the date of grant. Consequently, our STAP may require significant future cash payments to participants to the extent the price of our common stock appreciates and the number of vested STAP awards increases over time. If we do not have sufficient funds to meet such obligations or the ability to secure alternative sources of financing, we could be in default, face litigation and/or lose key employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInformation technology security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to legal responsibility which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, customers and business partners, and personally identifiable information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Such breaches could compromise sensitive and confidential information stored on our networks and expose such information to public disclosure, loss or theft. Any access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disruption of our operations, and damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock can be highly volatile and may decline.\nThe price of common stock can be highly volatile within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector. Consequently, there can be significant price and volume fluctuations in the market that may not relate to operating performance. The following table sets forth the high and low closing prices of our common stock for the periods indicated:\nThe price of our common stock could decline sharply due to the following factors, among others:\n\u2022 Failure to meet estimates or expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022 Quarterly and annual financial results;\n\u2022 Timing of enrollment and results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 Announcements by us or others regarding generic or other challenges to the intellectual property relating to our products, including developments with respect to the ANDAs filed by Sandoz and Teva relating to certain of our Remodulin patents and to our pending lawsuits defending our patent rights;\n\u2022 The outcome of the ongoing OIG investigation related to Remodulin, Tyvaso and Adcirca;\n\u2022 Physician, patient, investor or public concerns regarding the efficacy and/or safety of products marketed or being developed by us or by others;\n\u2022 Changes in, or new legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement of, our therapeutic products by Medicare, Medicaid or other government payers, and changes in reimbursement policies of private health insurance companies;\n\u2022 Announcements by us or others of technological innovations or new products or announcements regarding our existing products, including in particular, the development of new, competing PAH therapies;\n\u2022 Substantial sales of our common stock by us or our existing shareholders;\n\u2022 Future issuances of common stock by us or any other activity which could be viewed as being dilutive to our shareholders;\n\u2022 Rumors among, or incorrect statements by, investors and/or analysts concerning our company, our products, or our operations;\n\u2022 Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals from the FDA or international regulatory agencies;\n\u2022 Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products, or problems with our production, regulatory, compliance, promotional, marketing or sales activities that result in regulatory penalties or restrictions on our products, up to the withdrawal of our products from the market;\n\u2022 Accumulation of significant short positions in our common stock by hedge funds or other investors or the significant accumulation of our common stock by hedge funds or other institutional investors with investment strategies that may lead to short-term holdings; and\n\u2022 General market conditions.\nWe may fail to meet third-party projections for our revenues or profits.\nMany securities analysts publish quarterly and annual projections of our revenues and profits. Such projections are inherently subject to uncertainty. As a result, actual revenues and profits may fail to meet these projections. Even minor variations in reported revenues and profits compared to securities analysts' expectations could have a significant adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nSales or issuances of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock could decline if: (1) we issue common stock to raise capital or to acquire a license or business; (2) our shareholders transfer ownership of our common stock, or sell substantial amounts in the public market; (3) our investors become concerned that substantial sales of our common stock may occur; or (4) we issue shares upon the settlement of warrants relating to the hedging transaction relating to our Convertible Notes. A decrease in the price of our common stock could make it difficult for us to raise capital or fund acquisitions through the issuance of our stock.\nAny sales of common stock issued to holders of our Convertible Notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock or result in short selling by market participants in expectation of a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur share repurchases may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn recent years, our Board of Directors has authorized several programs to repurchase our common stock, including a $500.0 million share repurchase program effective during the one-year period that began on August 1, 2014. The price of our common stock may, in part, reflect expectations that our repurchase program will be fully consummated. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. If we fail to meet analyst or investor expectations regarding our repurchase program, our stock price may decline.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transaction.\nThe counterparty to the convertible note hedge transaction we entered into in connection with the issuance of our Convertible Notes (call options) will subject us to counterparty risk in that the counterparty may default on fulfilling its obligations under the call options. Our exposure to the credit risk of the counterparty will not be secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If such counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim based on our exposure at that time under the call options. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our stock due to our obligation to deliver shares subsequent to the conversion of the notes. We cannot provide any assurances as to the future financial stability or viability of the counterparty to our convertible note hedge transaction.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, second amended and restated by-laws, shareholder rights plan, Convertible Notes, convertible note hedge transaction and employment and license agreements, among other things, could prevent or delay a change of control or change in management that may be beneficial to our public shareholders.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, second amended and restated by-laws and shareholder rights plan may prevent, delay or discourage:\n\u2022 A merger, tender offer or proxy contest;\n\u2022 The assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities; and/or\n\u2022 The replacement or removal of current management by our shareholders.\nFor example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes. Members of each class are elected for staggered three-year terms. This provision may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace the majority of directors. It may also deter the accumulation of large blocks of our common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks.\nNon-competition and all other restrictive covenants in most of our employment agreements will terminate upon a change of control that is not approved by our Board.\nWe may be required to repurchase the outstanding Convertible Notes from their holders in the event of a fundamental change and increase the conversion rate in connection with a make whole adjustment event in certain circumstances, including a change of control of our company. This may delay or prevent a change in control of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders.\nTerminating or unwinding the convertible note hedge transaction could require us to make substantial payments to the counterparty or may increase the price of our common stock. The costs or any increase in stock price that may arise from terminating or unwinding the transaction could make an acquisition of our company significantly more expensive to the purchaser.\nSimilarly, a change of control, under certain circumstances, could also result in an acceleration of the vesting of outstanding STAP awards. This, together with any increase in our stock price resulting from the announcement of a change of control, could make an acquisition of our company significantly more expensive to the purchaser. We also have a broad-based change of control severance program, under which employees may be entitled to severance benefits in the event they are terminated without cause (or they terminate their employment for good reason) following a change of control. This program could also increase the cost of acquiring our company.\nWe enter into certain license agreements that generally prohibit our counterparties or their affiliates from taking necessary steps to acquire or merge with us, directly or indirectly throughout the term of these agreements, plus a specified period thereafter. We are also party to certain license agreements that restrict our ability to assign or transfer the rights licensed to us to third parties, including parties with whom we wish to merge, or those attempting to acquire us. These agreements often require that we obtain prior consent of the counterparties to these agreements if we are contemplating a change of control. If these counterparties withhold consent, related agreements could be terminated and we would lose related license rights. For example, both Lilly and Toray have the right to terminate our license agreements relating to Adcirca and beraprost, respectively, in the event of certain change of control transactions. These restrictive change of control provisions could impede or prevent mergers that could benefit our shareholders.\nBecause we do not intend to pay cash dividends, our shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the future. As a result, the return on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon the future appreciation in the price of our common stock. There can be no assurances that our common stock will provide a return to investors.", "PERMNO": 87006, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "UTHR"}
