{"cik": "1769663", "company": "Pioneer Bancorp, Inc./MD", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-12-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur loan portfolio consists of a high percentage of loans secured by commercial real estate. These loans carry a greater credit risk than loans secured by one- to four-family properties.\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans, primarily loans secured by office buildings, industrial facilities, retail facilities, multi-family properties and other commercial properties. At June 30, 2019, our commercial real estate loans totaled $414.4 million, or 38.9%, of our total loan portfolio. Our commercial real estate loans expose us to greater risk of nonpayment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation and income stream of the borrowers. If we foreclose on these loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for a one- to four-family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. In addition, commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential loans. Accordingly, charge-offs on commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. An unexpected adverse development on one or more of these types of loans can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties may be below that of owner-occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which have a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. As our commercial real estate loans increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase.\nA large portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other business assets, the deterioration in value of which could increase the potential for future losses.\nAt June 30, 2019, $183.3 million, or 17.2% of our total loan portfolio, was comprised of commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit to a variety of small and medium-sized businesses in our market area collateralized by general business assets including, among other things, accounts receivable and inventory, and we may augment this collateral with additional liens on real property. These commercial and industrial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a per loan basis. Additionally, the repayment of commercial and industrial loans is subject to the ongoing business operations of the borrower. The collateral securing such loans generally includes moveable property such as inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate, or may be difficult to market and sell, exposing us to increased credit risk. Significant adverse changes in the economy or local market conditions in which our commercial lending customers operate or individual business activities of our commercial customers could cause rapid declines in loan collectability and the values associated with general business assets, resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose us to credit losses and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe make and hold in our portfolio commercial construction loans, which are considered to have greater credit risk than residential loans made by financial institutions.\nWe originate and purchase commercial construction loans primarily to local developers to finance the construction of commercial and multi-family properties or to acquire land for development of commercial and multi-family properties and to finance infrastructure improvements. We also provide commercial construction loans to local developers for the construction of one- to four-family residential developments, and originate rehabilitation loans, enabling the borrower to partially or totally refurbish an existing structure. At June 30, 2019, commercial construction loans were $85.3 million, or 8.0% of our total loan portfolio. We also had undrawn amounts on the commercial construction loans totaling $83.7 million at June 30, 2019. Commercial construction loans are considered more risky than residential mortgage loans. The primary credit risks associated with construction lending are underwriting risks, project risks and market risks. Project risks include cost overruns, borrower credit risk, project completion risk, general contractor credit risk, and environmental and other hazard risks. Market risks are risks associated with the sale of the completed project. They include affordability risk, which means the risk of affordability of financing by borrowers, product design risk, and risks posed by competing projects.\nWe have a significant number of loans secured by real estate, and a downturn in the local real estate market could negatively impact our profitability.\nAt June 30, 2019, approximately $861.3 million, or 80.8%, of our total loan portfolio was secured by real estate, most of which is located in our primary lending market. Future declines in the real estate values in the Capital Region of New York and surrounding markets could significantly impair the value of the particular collateral securing our loans and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure for an amount necessary to satisfy the borrower\u2019s obligations to us. This could require increasing our allowance for loan losses to address the decrease in the value of the real estate securing our loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends primarily on the general economic conditions in our primary market area. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on our residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction, commercial and industrial and consumer lending, including, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nWhile economic conditions in our primary market remain strong, deterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u00b7\ndemand for our products and services may decrease;\n\u00b7\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u00b7\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u00b7\nthe value of our securities portfolio may decrease; and\n\u00b7\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decrease, thereby impairing their ability to honor commitments made to us.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect our financial performance. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to risks and losses resulting from fraudulent activities that could adversely impact our financial performance and results of operations.\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation or damage to our reputation. We are most subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, checking transactions, and debit cards that we have issued to our customers and through our online banking portals. We have experienced losses due to apparent fraud.\nSubsequent to fiscal year end, the Company became aware of potentially fraudulent activity associated with transactions conducted in the Company\u2019s first fiscal quarter of 2020 (the quarter ending September 30, 2019) by an established business customer of the Bank. The customer and various affiliated entities (collectively, the \u201cMann Entities\u201d), had numerous accounts with the Bank. The transactions in question relate both to deposit and lending activity with the Mann Entities. The Company continues to investigate this matter to determine the potential exposure of the Company. The Company is pursuing all available sources of recovery and other means of mitigating the potential loss. See - Note 17 - \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d for additional details.\nWith respect to its lending activity with the Mann Entities, the Bank\u2019s potential exposure is approximately $16 million (which represents the Bank\u2019s participation interest in approximately $36 million commercial loan relationships for which the Bank is the originating lender). In the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the Bank concluded that due to the impact of the potential fraudulent activity, it is more likely than not that the Bank will not be able to recover the loan balances. The Bank intends to record a provision for loan losses in the amount of $15.8 million, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, related to the charge-off of the entire principal balance owed to the Bank related to the customer\u2019s commercial loan relationships. With respect to its deposit activity, the Bank\u2019s potential exposure for the fraudulent activity is approximately $19.0 million. In the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the Bank exercised its legal right of setoffs on the deposit accounts held by the Mann Entities at the Bank. The Bank intends to recognize a charge to non-interest expense in the amount of $2.5 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 based on the net negative deposit balance of the various Mann Entity accounts after the setoffs.\nWhile the Company believes this recent incident is an isolated occurrence, there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur again or that such acts will be detected in a timely manner. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against such risks, including data processing system failures and errors, and customer fraud. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect any such occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company and Pioneer Bank may be regularly involved in a variety of litigation or similar matters arising out of our business. See, for example - Note 17 - \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d, for details regarding an action commenced against us on October 31, 2019. We are defending this lawsuit vigorously, and management believes that the Bank has substantial defenses to the claims that have been asserted. However, the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, or any other litigation involving the Company or the Bank, cannot be predicted with certainty. It also remains possible that other parties may pursue additional claims against the Bank related to the Bank\u2019s dealings with certain of the named defendants in this or other proceedings or that the Bank may not be successful in defending certain of its legal remedies. The Bank\u2019s legal fees and expenses related to such actions are expected to be significant. In addition, costs associated with potentially prosecuting, litigating or settling any litigation, satisfying any adverse judgments or penalties, if any, could be significant. These fees, expenses, costs and penalties could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s results of operations or financial position.\nIn addition, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in proceedings or litigation. Any such legal or regulatory actions may subject us to substantial compensatory or punitive damages, significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our reputation. Our involvement in any such matters, whether tangential or otherwise, and even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is established through a provision for loan losses that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses within the existing portfolio of loans. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of loans in our portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, or if certain intervening events occur (like fraud by a customer), our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, and adjustments may be necessary to address different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. Consequently, a problem with one or more loans could require us to significantly increase our provision for loan losses. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize additional loan charge-offs. Material additions to the allowance for loan losses would materially decrease our net income and would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. and Pioneer Bank for our first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of establishing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and increase the data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of our allowance for loan losses.\nChanges in interest rates may reduce our profits.\nOur profitability, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, our results of operations depend\nlargely on movements in market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in response to these movements. Factors such as inflation, recession and instability in financial markets, among other factors beyond our control, may affect interest rates.\nIf interest rates rise, and the interest rates on our deposits increase faster than the interest rates we receive on our loans and investments, our interest rate spread would decrease, which would have a negative effect on our net interest income and profitability. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan repayments on adjustable-rate loans, as the interest owed on such loans would increase as interest rates increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk as we may have to reinvest such loan or securities prepayments into lower-yielding assets, which may also negatively impact our income.\nIf interest rates rise, we expect that our net portfolio value of equity would decrease. Net portfolio value of equity represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities, adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet contracts. At June 30, 2019, and assuming a 200 basis points increase in market interest rates, we estimate that our net portfolio value would decrease by $16.5 million, or 7.5%. Additionally, at June 30, 2019 and assuming a 200 basis points decrease in market interest rates, we estimate that our net portfolio value would decrease by $4.3 million, or 2.0%.\nAny substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. While we pursue an asset/liability strategy designed to mitigate our risk from changes in interest rates, changes in interest rates can still have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate real estate loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions cannot fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet or projected operating results.\nMunicipal deposits are price sensitive and could result in an increase in interest expense or funding fluctuations.\nMunicipal deposits are a significant source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At June 30, 2019, $275.7 million, or 20.7% of our total deposits, consisted of municipal deposits from local government entities such as towns, cities, school districts and other municipalities, which are collateralized by letters of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and investment securities. Given our dependence on high-average balance municipal funds deposits as a source of funds, our inability to retain such funds could significantly and adversely affect our liquidity. Further, our municipal deposits are primarily demand deposit accounts and are therefore more sensitive to interest rate risk. If we are forced to pay higher rates on our municipal accounts to retain those funds, or if we are unable to retain such funds and we are forced to resort to other sources of funds for our lending and investment activities, such as borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we are currently paying on our municipal deposits, which would adversely affect our net income.\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio subjects us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors, (i) total reported loans for construction, land acquisition and development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-owner occupied, non-farm, non-residential properties, loans for construction, land acquisition and development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total capital. Based on these factors, we have a concentration in loans of the type described in (ii) above of 278.5% of our total capital at June 30, 2019. The purpose of the guidance is to assist banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate\nconcentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. Our bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to us or that may result in a curtailment of our commercial real estate and multi-family lending and/or the requirement that we maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, either of which would adversely affect our loan originations and profitability.\nWe use a third party to originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.\nWe have used a third-party mortgage banking company, Homestead Funding Corp., to underwrite, process and close our residential mortgage loans since January 2016. We use this company in order to offer our customers this loan product without the expense of maintaining and operating an in-house residential mortgage loan department. At June 30, 2019, one- to four-family residential real estate loans acquired from Homestead Funding Corp. totaled $177.0 million, or 16.6%, of our total loans receivable. Should we discontinue this relationship or otherwise be unable to use this company in the future, our ability to purchase residential mortgage loans may be disrupted unless we are able to find a suitable replacement or have or re-develop the capability to originate residential mortgage loans through our lending staff. Should we add more staff in such an event, our compensation expense would increase. Our income may be negatively affected if our residential mortgage lending program is disrupted.\nOur business strategy involves moderate growth, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nOur assets increased $598.7 million, or 67.9%, from $881.3 million at June 30, 2015 to $1.5 billion at June 30, 2019, primarily due to increases in loans receivable. Over the next several years, we expect to experience moderate growth in our total assets and deposits, and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets requires us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market. Our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the availability of attractive business opportunities, competition from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. While we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or that we will successfully manage our growth. If we do not manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to achieve our business plan, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio may reduce our profits and our capital levels.\nOur securities portfolio may be affected by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer\u2019s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts\u2019 reports and spread differentials between the effective rates on instruments in the portfolio compared to risk-free rates. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, we may take a charge to earnings to reflect such impairment. Changes in interest rates may also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are affected by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. Declines in market value may result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which may lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nA portion of our loan portfolio consists of loan participations secured by properties outside our market area. Loan participations may have a higher risk of loss than loans we originate because we are not the lead lender and we have limited control over credit monitoring.\nWe occasionally purchase commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and commercial construction loan participations secured by properties outside our market area in which we are not the lead lender. We have purchased loan participations secured by various types of collateral such as real estate, equipment and other business assets located in New York, Connecticut and Vermont. Loan participations may have a higher risk of loss than loans we originate because we rely on the lead lender to monitor the performance of the loan. Moreover, our decisions regarding the classification of a loan participation and loan loss provisions associated with a loan participation are made in part based upon information provided by the lead lender. A lead lender also may not monitor a participation loan in the same manner as we would for loans that we originate. At June 30, 2019, our loan participations where we are not the lead lender totaled $63.9 million, or 6.0% of our loan portfolio. At June 30, 2019, commercial and industrial loan participations outside our market area totaled $24.9 million, or 13.6% of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, commercial construction loan participations outside our market area totaled $9.4 million, or 11.0% of the commercial construction loan portfolio and commercial real estate loan participations outside our market area totaled $2.0 million, or 0.5% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio. At June 30, 2019, no loan participations were delinquent 60 days or more. If our underwriting of these participation loans is not sufficient, our non-performing loans may increase and our earnings may decrease.\nWe may, in the future, participate in structured financing transactions involving businesses inside and outside our market area that require alternative financing arrangements. While these types of arrangements may generate more income than our traditional commercial loans that we originate and hold in portfolio, they generally have greater credit risk because they involve lending to borrowers with higher risk profiles, the issuance of more complex financial instruments and the valuation of more complex underlying collateral.\nWe may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, is likely to have both positive and negative effects on our financial performance. Although the legislation\u2019s reduction in our federal corporate tax rate has had a favorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities, the legislation also enacted limitations on certain deductions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single-family residential real estate. These limitations include (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage and home equity loans, (ii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes.\nThe 2017 changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. In addition, these recent changes may also have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes, like New York. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConditions in insurance markets could adversely affect our earnings.\nAs we have diversified our sources of income, we have become increasingly reliant on non-interest income, particularly insurance fees and commissions. Revenue from these sources could be negatively affected by fluctuating premiums in the insurance markets or other factors beyond our control. Other factors that affect our insurance revenue are the profitability and growth of our clients, continued development of new products and services, as well as our access to new markets. Our insurance revenues and profitability may also be adversely affected by regulatory developments impacting healthcare and insurance markets, possibly including recent legislative proposals and discussions relating to national health insurance and the elimination of the private health insurance market.\nInvolvement in wealth management creates risks associated with the industry.\nOur wealth management operations with Pioneer Financial Services, Inc. present special risks not borne by institutions that focus exclusively on other traditional retail and commercial banking products. For example, the investment advisory industry is subject to fluctuations in the stock market that may have a significant adverse effect on transaction fees, client activity and client investment portfolio gains and losses. Also, additional or modified regulations may adversely affect our wealth management operations. In addition, our wealth management operations, are dependent on a small number of established financial advisors, whose departure could result in the loss of a significant number of client accounts. A significant decline in fees and commissions or trading losses suffered in the investment portfolio could adversely affect our income and potentially require the contribution of additional capital to support our operations.\nChanges in market conditions, changes in discount rates, changes in mortality assumptions or lower returns on assets may increase required contributions to, and costs associated with, our tax-qualified defined benefit plan in future periods.\nThe funded status and benefit obligations of our tax-qualified defined benefit plan (\u201cpension plan\u201d) is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, certain market interest rates, the discount rates and mortality assumptions used to determine pension obligations. The pension plan liability is calculated based on various actuarial assumptions, including mortality expectations, discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Unfavorable returns on plan assets could materially change the amount of required plan funding, which would reduce the cash available for our operations. In addition, a decrease in the discount rate and/or changes in the mortality assumptions used to determine pension obligations could increase the estimated value of our pension obligations, which would require us to increase the amounts of future contributions to the plan, thereby reducing our equity and our costs associated with the plan may substantially increase in future periods.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by our banking regulators. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of insurance funds and the depositors and borrowers of Pioneer Bank rather than for the protection of our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on our operations, classify our assets and determine the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, deposit insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the ways financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives, and prepare financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and may involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firms. These changes could materially impact, potentially retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nStrong competition within our market area may reduce our profits and slow growth.\nWe face strong competition in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits sometimes requires us to charge lower interest rates on our loans and pay higher interest rates on our deposits, and may reduce our net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Many of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. Our competitors often aggressively price loan and deposit products when they enter into new lines of business or new market areas. If we are unable to effectively compete in our market area, our profitability would be negatively affected. The greater resources and broader offering of deposit and loan products of some of our competitors may also limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or restrict us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nFederal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which were effective for us on January 1, 2015, and define what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (1) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (2) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (3) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The regulations also require unrealized gains and losses on certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings to be included for calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. We elected to exercise our one-time option to opt-out of the requirement under the final rule to include certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings for calculating our regulatory capital requirements. The regulations also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, resulting in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (2) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until it was fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2018 (the \u201cRegulatory Relief Act\u201d) simplifies capital calculations by requiring the federal regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that eligible institutions may choose to elect to replace the risk-based capital requirements under the Basel III capital rules for such institutions. Institutions that meet the community bank leverage ratio will automatically be deemed to be well-capitalized under the federal regulator\u2019s prompt corrective action framework, although the regulators retain the flexibility to determine that an institution may not qualify for the community bank leverage ratio test based on the institution\u2019s risk profile. The federal regulators jointly issued a final rule on October 29, 2019, whereby a qualifying community bank organization may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio capital framework, in which case it will be considered well-capitalized so long as its community bank leverage ratio is greater than 9%. The new rule takes effect on January 1, 2020.\nThe application of more stringent Basel III capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating Basel III regulatory capital and/or additional Basel III capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy, and could limit our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our shares.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers that open new financial accounts. In addition, we have not timely filed all of our call reports with our federal banking regulator in violation of federal banking regulations, and as a result, it is possible that the regulator will impose significant fines. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. Several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nOur success depends on retaining certain key personnel.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals who comprise our senior management team. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as loan and deposit generation, wealth management and insurance businesses. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect our income. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which would reduce our net income. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nSystems failures or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nOur operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures designed to prevent such damage, our security measures may not be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is possible that we could incur significant costs associated with a breach of our computer systems. While we have cyber liability insurance, there are limitations on coverage. Furthermore, cyber incidents carry a greater risk of injury to our reputation. Finally, depending on the type of incident, banking regulators can impose restrictions on our business and consumer laws may require reimbursement of customer losses.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and bank regulators, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nChanges in management\u2019s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results.\nIn preparing periodic reports we are required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our consolidated financial statements, our management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of specified dates. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and experience at such times and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the legal remedies available to the Bank related to the potentially fraudulent activities, our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, the determination of our deferred income taxes, our fair value measurements, our determination of other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities, our evaluation of contingent liabilities, and our evaluation of our defined benefit pension plan obligations.\nThe cost of additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our new public company reporting requirements will increase our expenses.\nAs a result of the completion of our initial public offering, we became a public reporting company. The obligations of being a public company, including the substantial public reporting obligations, require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a stand-alone public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d) requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. In addition, we may need to hire additional compliance, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical knowledge, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion. As a result, we may need to rely on outside consultants to provide these services for us until qualified personnel are hired. These obligations will increase our operating expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our operations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.\nOur risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We try to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use broad and diversified risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses if we fail to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected as a result of certain actions we take, by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our\noperations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nPioneer Bancorp, MHC\u2019s majority control of our common stock will enable it to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders and will prevent stockholders from forcing a sale or a second-step conversion transaction you may find advantageous.\nPioneer Bancorp, MHC owns a majority of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc.\u2019s common stock and, through its board of trustees, will be able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders. Most of the directors and officers who manage Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. and Pioneer Bank also manage Pioneer Bancorp, MHC. As a New York-chartered mutual holding company, the board of trustees of Pioneer Bancorp, MHC must ensure that the interests of depositors of Pioneer Bank are represented and considered in matters put to a vote of stockholders of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. Therefore, the votes cast by Pioneer Bancorp, MHC may not be in your personal best interests as a stockholder. For example, Pioneer Bancorp, MHC may exercise its voting control to defeat a stockholder nominee for election to the board of directors of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. and will be able to elect all of the directors of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. Some stockholders may desire a sale or merger transaction, since stockholders typically receive a premium for their shares, or a second-step conversion transaction, since, on a fully converted basis most fully stock institutions tend to trade at higher multiples of book value than mutual holding companies. However, stockholders will not be able to force a merger or a second-step conversion transaction without the consent of Pioneer Bancorp, MHC since such transactions also require, under New York and federal law, the approval of a majority of all of the outstanding voting stock, which can only be achieved if Pioneer Bancorp, MHC votes to approve such transactions.\nOur common stock is not heavily traded, and the stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cPBFS.\u201d Certain brokers currently make a market in the common stock, but such transactions are infrequent and the volume of shares traded is relatively small. Management cannot predict whether these or other brokers will continue to make a market in our common stock. Prices on stock that is not heavily traded, such as our common stock, can be more volatile than heavily traded stock. Factors such as our financial results, the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors, publicity regarding the banking industry, and various other factors affecting the banking industry may have a significant impact on the market price of the shares of the common stock. Management also cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained in the future. Accordingly, stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of our common stock at the volumes, prices, or times that they desire.\nContinued delays in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC could impact our listing on Nasdaq, which would materially and adversely affect our stock price, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nAs a result of potentially fraudulent activity by an established business customer of Pioneer Bank, we were unable to file this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on a timely basis. We have not filed our Quarterly Report on Form10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, which was due in November 2019. As a result, we have received delinquency letters from Nasdaq regarding our noncompliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. We have until December 16, 2019 to submit our delinquent form 10-Q or to submit a plan to regain compliance to Nasdaq. If Nasdaq accepts our plan, it may grant us an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Company\u2019s Form 10-K, or until March 30, 2020, to regain compliance. If we are not able to file our delinquent Form 10-Q before March 30, 2020, our common stock may be subject to delisting by Nasdaq.\nFederal Reserve Board regulations and policy effectively prohibit Pioneer Bancorp, MHC from waiving the receipt of dividends, which will likely preclude us from paying any dividends on our common stock.\nPioneer Bancorp, Inc.\u2019s board of directors will have the authority to declare dividends on our common stock subject to statutory and regulatory requirements. We currently intend to retain all our future earnings, if any, for use in our\nbusiness and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be made by our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions under Federal Reserve Board regulations and policy, our business strategy and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nUnder current Federal Reserve Board regulations and policy, if Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. pays dividends to its public stockholders, it also would be required to pay dividends to Pioneer Bancorp, MHC, unless Pioneer Bancorp, MHC waives the receipt of such dividends. Federal Reserve Board policy has been to prohibit mutual holding companies that are regulated as bank holding companies, such as Pioneer Bancorp, MHC, from waiving the receipt of dividends and the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s regulations implemented after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act effectively prohibit federally-chartered mutual holding companies from waiving dividends declared by their subsidiaries. Therefore, unless Federal Reserve Board regulations or policy change to allow Pioneer Bancorp, MHC to waive the receipt of dividends declared by Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. without diluting minority stockholders, it is unlikely that Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. will pay any dividends.\nOur stock value may be negatively affected by applicable regulations that restrict stock repurchases.\nApplicable regulations restrict us from repurchasing any of our shares of common stock during the first year following the offering and limit us from repurchasing our shares of common stock during each of the second and third years following the offering to 5% of our outstanding shares, unless we obtain prior approval from the NYSDFS. Stock repurchases are a capital management tool that can enhance the value of a company\u2019s stock, and our inability to repurchase any of our shares of common stock during the first year following the offering and limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares of common stock during the second and third years following the offering may negatively affect our stock price.\nVarious factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve.\nStock banks and savings banks or holding companies, as well as individuals, may not acquire control of a mutual holding company, such as Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. As result, the only persons that may acquire control of a mutual holding company are other mutual savings institutions or mutual holding companies. Accordingly, it is very unlikely, that Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. would be subject to any takeover attempt by activist stockholders or other financial institutions. In addition, certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of Pioneer Bancorp, Inc. without our board of directors\u2019 prior approval.\nUnder Federal Reserve Board regulations, for a period of three years following completion of the offering, no person may directly or indirectly acquire or offer to acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10% of our common stock without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring control of a bank holding company. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer \u201ccontrols\u201d the bank holding company. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any bank, including Pioneer Bank.\nThere also are provisions in our articles of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt, including a provision that generally prohibits any person, other than Pioneer Bancorp, MHC, from voting more than 10% of the shares of common stock outstanding. Taken as a whole, these statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and thus could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and if we elect to comply only with the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies\nbut not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions.\nAs an emerging growth company, we also will not be subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering. We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (1) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of this offering; (2) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more; (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (4) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million at the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nOur contribution to the charitable foundation may not be tax deductible, which could reduce our profits.\nWe may not have sufficient profits to be able to fully use the tax deduction from our contribution to the charitable foundation. Under the Internal Revenue Code, an entity is permitted to deduct up to 10% of its taxable income (generally income before federal income taxes and charitable contributions expense) in any one year for charitable contributions. Any contribution in excess of the 10% limit may be deducted for federal income tax purposes over each of the five years following the year in which the charitable contribution is made. Accordingly, a charitable contribution could, if necessary, be deducted over a six-year period and expires thereafter.", "PERMNO": 18847, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "PBFS"}
