{"cik": "880562", "company": "DAEGIS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating our business, readers should carefully consider the business risks discussed in this section in addition to the other information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference herein and in our other filings with the SEC. All of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the risks discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could, in the future, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all of our potential risks or uncertainties.\nThe markets in which we compete are subject to rapid technological change.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new and enhanced products, changes in customer and client demands and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable.\nOur future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of customers and clients by developing new product functionality and enhancements that keep pace with technological developments, emerging industry standards and customers and client requirements.\nThere can be no assurance that our products will continue to be perceived by our customers and clients as technologically advantageous or that we will not experience difficulties that delay or prevent the sale of enhancements to existing products that meet with a significant degree of market acceptance. If the release dates of any future product enhancements, or new products are delayed, or if when released, they fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unsuccessful at addressing market changes, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited.\nWe believe the eDiscovery market is heading toward a complete solution starting with information governance at the archive level through data collection, processing and review. To address this expected market change, we embarked on a restructuring and realignment initiative of the Company, which we completed in fiscal 2015. The alignment included changes in our executive team, the alignment of our Archive and eDiscovery businesses and products, non-voluntary workforce reductions and facility consolidations. In addition, we implemented a strategy of selling a combined enterprise product portfolio directly and through channel sales. If these activities are unsuccessful, or if we have misinterpreted or incorrectly anticipated market changes, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nDeterioration in general economic conditions and fluctuations in project-based work has caused and could cause additional decreases or delays in spending by customers and clients and could harm our ability to generate revenues and our results of operations.\nOur revenue tends to be cyclical and depends significantly upon economic conditions and the demand for software, support and services in the markets in which we compete. The state of the global economy and availability of capital has and could further impact the spending patterns of existing and potential future customers and clients. In addition, much of our revenue is project-based and can fluctuate based on the timing of the projects. Any delays or reduction in spending by, or loss of, existing or potential future customers and clients would cause revenues to decline. Further, it may be difficult to adjust expenses and capital expenditures quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall and any decreased collectability of accounts receivable or early termination of agreements due to deterioration in economic conditions could negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe failure of the business community to adopt a combined Archive and eDiscovery solution could negatively affect future revenue.\nCurrently, most companies separately manage their archive and eDiscovery solution needs. Document archive is managed through a company\u2019s IT department; eDiscovery through the office of the general counsel or outside law firms. In some cases, the company may have a longstanding and entrenched relationship with their archiving provider and may source its large scale eDiscovery activity through law firms. We believe the market and corporations are moving toward a single solution approach for information governance with a combined archive and eDiscovery solution. Moving data in and out of systems is complex, expensive and fraught with the risk of compromising or losing data. Daegis\u2019 single solution approach to information governance and eDiscovery mitigates risk, simplifies processes and lowers costs for corporations. As a result, we have realigned and restructured our business combining our Archive and eDiscovery products to provide a cohesive information governance solution. However, corporations may prefer to stay with their current archive and eDiscovery service providers. The failure of the market to adopt a combined, complete information governance solution could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nWe are subject to intense competition.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from current and future competitors including Access Data, FTI Technologies, kCura, HP, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Sencha and Symantec. Often, these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, in addition to having greater name recognition and more extensive customer and client bases. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer and client requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.\nIn addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers and clients. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. Such competition could adversely affect our ability to sell additional licenses, subscriptions, and maintenance and support renewals on terms favorable to us. Further, competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our products and related services, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competition, and the failure to do so would have an adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of our larger customers or clients.\nSome of our key customers and clients account for a large portion of our revenue. While we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers and clients, if any of our key customers and clients were to significantly reduce their purchases from us, our results of operations would be adversely affected. While sales to major customers and clients may vary from period to period, a major customer or client that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015, we had one client that accounted for 8% of consolidated revenue and constituted 0% of consolidated accounts receivable at April 30, 2015. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2014 that same client account for 17% of consolidated revenue and constituted 19% of consolidated accounts receivable at April 30, 2014. There can be no assurance that we will not lose such key customers and clients, and the loss of key customers and clients could have an adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA portion of the Information Governance business is project or matter-based resulting in unpredictable revenue.\nA portion of the information governance product derives its revenues from providing services for legal matters received from its clients and from hosting fees for holding data that has been processed. The timing of legal matters is project based and the receipt of these projects is difficult to predict and the related revenue is difficult to forecast. In most cases the eDiscovery client contracts are month-to-month such that there is no assurance as to the length of time that we may receive revenue from a client. Revenue from our information governance products can fluctuate significantly in a short time frame for a number of reasons including; a legal matter is settled and the project ends, a client has a reduction in legal matters, a client decides to have future legal matters processed by another eDiscovery vendor. Clients can also request their data be removed from our servers with little notice such that our hosting revenue could also be adversely impacted.\nThe Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, which matures on June 30, 2017, contains certain restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business, and if we default on such indebtedness, all or a portion of our assets could be subject to forfeiture.\nOn June 30, 2011, the Company entered into the Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Capital Finance (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d). The Credit Agreement contains, and any other future debt agreement we enter into may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, including but not limited to, in each case subject to certain exceptions, restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, consolidate, merge or sell our assets unless specified conditions are met, acquire other business organizations, make investments, redeem or repurchase our stock, and change the nature of our business.\nThe Credit Agreement matures on June 30, 2017, at which time all remaining principal payments will become due. If our cash is insufficient to repay the remaining principal payments under the Credit Agreement at maturity, we may need to enter into an additional debt financing agreement. We cannot provide any assurance that we will have sufficient cash on hand to repay the Credit Agreement when it matures or whether we will be able to successfully refinance the credit agreement. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining additional debt financing, we may be unable to repay the remaining principal payment which would result in an event of default under the agreement. An event of default may have a significant adverse impact on our ability to operate our business.\nIn addition, our debt agreements contain financial covenants and additional affirmative and negative covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. If we are not able to comply with all of these covenants for any reason and we have debt outstanding at the time of such failure, some or all of our outstanding debt could become immediately due and payable and the incurrence of additional debt under the credit facilities provided by the debt agreements would not be allowed. If our cash is utilized to repay any outstanding debt, depending on the amount of debt outstanding, we could experience an immediate and significant adverse reduction in working capital available to operate our business.\nAs a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be significantly restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, such as strategic acquisitions or joint ventures.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, we granted to Wells Fargo a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets. If we default on the Credit Agreement and are unable to cure the default pursuant to the terms of the agreement, or are unable to enter into a forbearance or similar agreement, Wells Fargo could take possession of any or all assets in which it holds a security interest, including intellectual property, and dispose those assets to the extent necessary to pay off the debts, which may have a significant impact on our ability to operate our business. Furthermore, we may enter into other secured credit or loan agreements in the future, however, we cannot provide any assurance that any such facilities would be available to us or that the terms of any such facilities would be on terms similar to the terms of the Credit Agreement.\nWe are currently operating under a Forbearance Agreement with respect to the Credit Agreement.\nEffective July 31, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement. This amendment modified certain financial covenants, waived the one-time excess cash flow payment due in respect of fiscal year end April 30, 2015 and provides that the lenders under the Credit Agreement (the \u201cLenders\u201d), subject to no other defaults occurring and other conditions, to forbear from exercising their rights and remedies under the Credit Agreement through November 30, 2015 as it relates to breaches of certain financial covenants for the period ended July 31, 2015.\nThe Company continues to explore alternatives in order to resolve this default and repay the facilities. However, this is no guarantee that the Company will be able to enter into an alternative arrangement in a timely manner or under such terms as are acceptable to the Lenders. In the event that the Company otherwise defaults under the Credit Agreement or is unable to enter into such an acceptable arrangement, or if, by the end of November 30, 2015, the Company and its lenders have not entered into another forbearance agreement or otherwise reached an agreement regarding the Credit Agreement, the Lenders have the right to declare all of the obligations under the Credit Agreement due and payable, including principal and interest, as authorized by the Credit Agreement. Such a result could have an adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on indirect sales channels.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from indirect sales channels, including ISVs, VARs and distributors. ISVs, VARs and distributors accounted for approximately 51% and 31% of our software license and maintenance revenues for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our success therefore depends in part upon the performance of our indirect sales channels, over which we have limited influence. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future depends in part on maintaining and expanding our indirect sales channels worldwide. The loss of any major partners, either to competitive products offered by other companies or to products developed internally by those partners, or the failure to attract effective new partners, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThere are numerous risks associated with our international operations and sales.\nRevenues derived from our international customers and clients accounted for 51% and 47% of our total revenues, with the remainder from the U.S., in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. If the revenues generated by our international operations are not adequate to offset the expense of maintaining such operations, our overall business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to successfully market, sell and deliver our products in these markets. Although we have had international operations for a number of years, there are certain unique business challenges and risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S., and such challenges and risks can vary from region to region. These include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; export restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; longer payment cycles; problems in collecting accounts receivable; political instability; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in Europe and other parts of the world; unfamiliar or unusual business practices; and potentially adverse tax consequences, any of which could adversely impact the success of our international operations. There can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have an adverse effect on our future international operations and, consequently, on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and distributors in Europe and Asia Pacific operate in local currencies. If the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur products are subject to lengthy sales cycles; our changed sales strategy could lengthen our sales cycle.\nOur information governance solutions are used to implement governance and matter driven requirements and involve legal, IT and risk management departments. Our development, database, and migration solutions are used to implement comprehensive solutions including complete technology platform transitions and new applications. The delivery of our migration solutions generally involves a long implementation time and a significant commitment of management attention and resources by prospective customers. Accordingly, our sales cycle is subject to delays associated with the long approval process that typically accompanies significant initiatives or capital expenditures. Our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if customers and clients reduce or delay orders. There can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience these and additional delays in the future. In addition, the strategy for our information governance solution is to change our sales focus to longer term solutions for corporations versus the transactional nature of our legal clients. This change in strategy can result in a longer sales cycle for our information governance solutions and has, and may in the future, adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Such delays may contribute to significant adverse fluctuations of quarterly operating results in the future and may adversely affect those results.\nOur stock price may be subject to volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be subject to significant volatility. A variety of factors could cause the price of the common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in the operating results and order levels of Daegis or its competitors; general conditions in the industry or the worldwide economy; announcements of technological innovations; new products or product enhancements from us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; developments in patent, copyright or other intellectual property rights; and developments in our relationships with our customers and clients, distributors and suppliers; legal proceedings brought against the Company or its officers; and significant changes in our senior management team. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general, and the market for shares of equity securities of many high technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. Such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nBeginning on August 25, 2008, the Company\u2019s stock started trading on the NASDAQ. Prior to being traded on the NASDAQ, the Company\u2019s stock was traded over-the-counter on the \u201cbulletin board\u201d. Even though our stock is now traded on the NASDAQ, we do not receive any analyst coverage, our stock is thinly traded and our stock is considered to be micro-cap stock. Our stock is therefore subject to greater price volatility than larger companies whose stock trades more actively.\nThe exercise price of certain warrants may be substantially below the market price of our stock at the time of exercise which could potentially have a negative impact on our stock price.\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Daegis in June 2010, we obtained debt financing and issued 718,860 warrants, and as of April 30, 2015, 718,860 warrants remained outstanding, and are exercisable at a fixed exercise price of $2.45 per share. Exercise of the warrants is only likely to occur at such time as the exercise price is lower than the current market price for our stock. Issuance of common stock at a price below our current market price would have a dilutive effect on current stockholders and could potentially have a negative impact on our stock price.\nWe may not satisfy the NASDAQ requirements for continued listing. If we cannot satisfy these requirements, NASDAQ could delist our common stock.\nOn April 15, 2015, the Company received a letter from NASDAQ indicating that, for the thirty consecutive business days ending April 14, 2015, the closing bid price for the Company\u2019s common stock was below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ. On June 23, 2015 the Company was notified that the NASDAQ Qualifications Panel granted the Company\u2019s request for an extension through October 12, 2015 to evidence compliance with the NASDAQ\u2019s $1.00 minimum closing bid requirement.\nWe cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to satisfy the NASDAQ listing requirements in the future. If we are delisted from NASDAQ, trading in our common stock may be conducted, if available, on the \u201cOTC Bulletin Board Service\u201d or, if available, via another market. In the event of such delisting, an investor would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the value of our common stock, and our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our common stock or other securities convertible into our common stock could be severely limited. In addition, if our common stock were delisted from NASDAQ, our common stock could be considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the U.S. federal securities laws. Additional regulatory requirements apply to trading by broker-dealers of penny stocks that could result in the loss of an effective trading market for our common stock.\nOur quarterly operating results may be subject to fluctuations and seasonal variability.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and we expect that they could vary significantly in the future. Such variations could result from the following factors: the size and timing of significant orders and their fulfillment; demand for our products and services; the quantity, timing and significance of our product enhancements and new product announcements or those of our competitors; the loss of a significant customer or client; our ability to attract and retain key employees; seasonality; changes in our pricing or our competitors\u2019; realignments of our organizational structure; changes in the level of our operating expenses; incurrence of extraordinary operating expenses, changes in our sales incentive plans; budgeting cycles of our customers and clients; customer and client order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products offered by us or our competitors; product life cycles; product defects and other product quality problems; currency fluctuations; and general domestic and international economic and political conditions.\nDue to the foregoing factors, quarterly revenues and operating results may vary on a quarterly basis. Revenues and quarterly results may vary because software technology is rapidly evolving, and our sales cycle, from initial evaluation to purchase and the providing of maintenance services, can be lengthy and vary substantially from customer to customer or from client to client. With the exception of our support and consulting services, we normally deliver products within a short time of receiving an order and therefore we typically do not have a backlog of orders. As a result, to achieve our quarterly revenue objectives, we are dependent upon obtaining orders in any given quarter for shipment in that quarter. Furthermore, because many customers and clients place orders toward the end of a fiscal quarter, we generally recognize a substantial portion of our software license revenues at the end of a quarter. Our expense levels largely reflect our expectations for future revenue and are therefore somewhat fixed in the short term.\nWe expect that our operating results will continue to be affected by the challenging IT economic environment and cyclical nature of the eDiscovery market.\nOur software products could contain defects and could be subject to potential release delays.\nSoftware products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. There can be no assurance that, despite testing by us and current and potential customers and clients, defects and errors will not be found in current versions, new versions or enhancements after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of revenues, delay in market acceptance, or unexpected re-programming costs, which could have an adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, if the release dates of any future Company product line additions or enhancements are delayed or if, when released, they fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nOur products and services may be subject to liability claims.\nAny failure by our products or in the performance of services could result in liability claims against us which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance, industry reputation and ability to market new products. For certain of our customers and clients, we enter into \u201cService Level Agreements\u201d that require us to perform at certain defined levels such that any failure to do so could subject us to significant penalties or litigation. We maintain insurance to protect against claims associated with the use of our products and services as well as liability limitation language in our agreements, but there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage or contractual language would adequately cover any claim asserted against us. A successful claim brought against us in excess of or outside of our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even unsuccessful claims could result in our expenditure of funds for litigation and management time and resources.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims related to the products and services we provide, that such claims will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage, that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates. Such claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely upon technology from certain third-party suppliers.\nWe are dependent on third-party suppliers for software which is embedded in some of its products. We believe that the functionality provided by software which is licensed from third parties is obtainable from multiple sources or could be developed by the Company. However, if any such third-party licenses were terminated, or not renewed, or if these third parties fail to develop new products in a timely manner, we could be required to develop an alternative approach to developing such products, which could require payment of additional fees to third parties or internal development costs and delays that might not be successful in providing the same level of functionality. Such delays, increased costs or reduced functionality could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture government legislation or changes in court rules could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur products and services are not directly regulated by the government. A number of our customers are, however, directly or indirectly affected by federal and state laws and regulations and court rules. For example, bankruptcy reform legislation, class action and tort reform legislation and amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding discovery of \"electronically stored information\" have affected our customers, and, indirectly, our business. Future legislation, rules and regulations, or court interpretations of those laws and rules, could adversely affect the markets we serve and thus could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to violations of our intellectual property rights or lawsuits from third parties for alleged infringement of their intellectual property rights.\nDaegis relies on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect its proprietary technology. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our technology exists, piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate and, to the extent such rights are not adequate, other companies could independently develop similar products using similar technology.\nAlthough there are no pending lawsuits against us regarding infringement of any existing patents or other intellectual property rights, and we have received no notices that we are infringing or allegedly infringing the intellectual property rights of others, there can be no assurance that such infringement claims will not be asserted by third parties in the future. If any such claims are asserted, there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend such claim or if necessary obtain licenses on reasonable terms. Our involvement in any patent dispute or other intellectual property dispute or action to protect trade secrets and know-how may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Adverse determinations in any litigation may subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require that we seek licenses from third parties and prevent us from developing and selling our products. Any of these situations could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur success is dependent upon the retention of key personnel and we may be unable to retain key employees.\nOur future performance depends on the continued service of key technical, sales and senior management personnel. Other than our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, there are no technical, sales, executive or other senior management personnel bound by an employment agreement. The loss of the services of one or more of our officers or other key employees could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may fail to retain our key technical, sales and managerial employees, or attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel in the future.\nSystem failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend.\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by, among other things, earthquake, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events. While we continue to improve our disaster recovery processes, system failures and other interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have a redundant data center with the intent to mitigate these risks, however, it is located in a similar geographic area and a large scale disaster could potentially disrupt both facilities.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective to detect all errors or to detect and deter wrongdoing, fraud or improper activities in all instances.\nWhile we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud. In designing our control systems, management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further the design of a control system must reflect the necessity of considering the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of inherent limitations in any control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of wrongdoing, if any, that may affect our operations, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake and that controls may be circumvented by individual acts by some person, by collusion of two or more people or by management\u2019s override of the control. The design of any control system also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of a potential future event, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in cost-effective control systems, misstatements due to error or wrongdoing may occur and not be detected. Over time, it is also possible that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that could not be, or were not, anticipated at inception or review of the control systems. Any breakdown in our control systems, whether or not foreseeable by management, could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reporting and may have an adverse impact on our business and on the market price for the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIf we do not maintain effective internal controls and systems, our business may suffer and the value of our shareholders\u2019 investment may be harmed.\nSection 404 requires management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and fraud may be easier to perpetrate on us. Any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nAcquisitions may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn the future, we may make smaller strategic acquisitions as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction may not advance our business strategy, that we don\u2019t realize a satisfactory return on our investment, or that we experience difficulty in the integration of new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of management\u2019s attention from our other businesses. These events could harm our operating results or financial condition.\nEconomic or other business factors may lead us to further write down the carrying amount of our goodwill or long-lived assets, which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of April 30 each year, or more frequently when indicators of impairment are present. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist. No impairment charges were necessary in fiscal 2015 and 2014 in connection with our annual impairment analysis. We continue to monitor relevant market and economic conditions, including the price of our stock, and perform appropriate impairment reviews when conditions deteriorate such that we believe the value of our goodwill could be impaired or an impairment exists in our long-lived assets. It is possible that conditions could deteriorate due to economic or other factors that affect our business, resulting in the need to write down the carrying amount of our goodwill or long-lived assets to fair value at the time of such assessment. As a result, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face the possibility of damages resulting from internal and external security breaches and viruses.\nIn the course of our business operations, we compile and transmit confidential information in our processing center and other facilities. A breach of security in any of these facilities could damage our reputation and result in damages being assessed against us. In addition, the other systems with which we may interface, such as the internet and related systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, viruses, programming errors, or similar disruptive problems. The effect of these security breaches and related issues could disrupt our ability to perform certain key business functions and could potentially reduce demand for our services. Accordingly, we have expended significant resources toward establishing and enhancing the security of our related infrastructures, although no assurance can be given that they will be entirely free from potential breach. Maintaining and enhancing our infrastructure security may require us to expend significant capital in the future.\nThe success of our strategy to offer our EDI services and internet solutions depends on the confidence of our clients in our ability to securely receive and transmit confidential information. Our EDI services and solutions rely on encryption, authentication and other security technology licensed from third parties to achieve secure transmission of confidential information. We may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to or disrupt the transmission of communications by our clients. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate confidential user information or interrupt our or our clients\u2019 operations. In addition, our EDI and internet solutions may be vulnerable to viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.\nAny failure to provide secure infrastructure and/or electronic communication services could result in a lack of trust by our clients causing them to seek out other vendors and/or damage our reputation in the market, making it difficult to obtain new clients, thereby possibly having a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results or financial condition.\nIf our security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to a client\u2019s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, clients may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur services involve the storage and transmission of clients\u2019 proprietary information. Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software are very important. A party, whether internal or external, that is able to circumvent our security systems could, among other things, misappropriate or misuse sensitive or confidential information, user information or other proprietary information, cause significant interruptions in our operations and cause all or portions of our website to be unavailable. Internal or external parties may attempt to circumvent our security systems. While we currently expend significant resources to protect against cyber-attacks we may need to expend additional significant resources in the future to continue to protect against potential security breaches or to address problems caused by such attacks or any breach of our systems. Further, any reductions in the availability of our website could impair our ability to conduct our business and adversely impact our clients during the occurrence of any such incident. Because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address all possible techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures for all situations.\nNoncompliance with any privacy laws or data security laws or any security incident or breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of sensitive or confidential client information, whether by us, one of our employees or a third party, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to: material fines and penalties; compensatory, special, punitive, and statutory damages; litigation; consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices; requirements that we provide notices, credit monitoring services and/or credit restoration services or other relevant services to impacted individuals; adverse actions against our licenses to do business; and injunctive relief. Additionally, the costs incurred to remediate any data security or privacy incident could be substantial.", "PERMNO": 83704, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "DAEG"}
