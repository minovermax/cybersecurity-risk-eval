{"cik": "9892", "company": "BARD C R INC /NJ/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in evaluating our business. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nDefects, failures or quality issues associated with our products could lead to recalls or safety alerts, negative publicity regarding the company and litigation, including product liability claims, that could adversely affect our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. Loss reserves are difficult to estimate.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types we produce entail inherent risks. Quality is extremely important to us and to our customers because our products are often used in clinically demanding circumstances with seriously ill patients, and many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. Given the circumstances in which our products are often used, defects, failures or quality issues can result in serious and costly consequences. Quality management is essential to prevent defects or failures associated with our products, as well as to improve our products and maintain the integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy of our products.\nThere are a number of factors that could result in an unsafe condition, injury or death of a patient with respect to products that we manufacture or sell, including quality issues, component failures, manufacturing flaws, unanticipated, unapproved or improper uses of our products, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information.\nI-7\nAny of these issues could lead to an investigation by the FDA or other governmental authorities, recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products and could ultimately result in the removal of these products from the body and claims against us for costs associated with the removal. Any recall, whether voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries, could result in lost sales, other significant costs and significant negative publicity. Negative publicity concerning our products, competitors\u2019 products or the geographic or product markets in which we compete, including regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could reduce market acceptance of our products, harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, result in the loss of customers, lead to product withdrawals and/or harm our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future. The foregoing problems could also result in enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, or product liability claims or lawsuits including those being brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class or establish multi-district litigation proceedings. We believe that some settlements and judgments, as well as legal defense costs, may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies, or, in some circumstances, indemnification obligations to us from other parties. However, amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available. For certain product liability claims or lawsuits, the company does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below for a description of lawsuits filed or asserted against us, including the Hernia Product Claims, Women\u2019s Health Product Claims and Filter Product Claims (each, as defined below). Moreover, in some circumstances adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture, quality or marketing of our products could result in the FDA suspending or delaying its review of our applications for new product approvals, or imposing post market approval requirements. Any of the foregoing problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nReserves established for estimated losses, including with respect to legal proceedings, do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, additional reserves may be established from time-to-time, and actual losses may be materially higher or lower than the related reserve. Liabilities in excess of our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nWe face intense competition from other companies, and our inability to continue to effectively develop, acquire and/or market new products and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nThe medical device business is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. Our customers consider many factors when choosing among products, including features and reliability, quality, technology, clinical or economic outcomes, availability, price and services provided by the manufacturer. We face competition globally from a wide range of companies, some of which may have greater resources than us, which may enable them to adapt faster than us to customer needs or changes in customer requirements. Product introductions, alternative therapies or enhancements by competitors that provide better features, clinical outcomes or economic value and/or offer lower pricing may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. In addition, the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry and among our customers could result in greater competition and pricing pressures.\nAs a result, we engage in product development and improvement programs to maintain and improve our competitive position. These development and improvement programs involve significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals and may require more time than anticipated to bring such products to market. We may not, however, be successful in enhancing existing products or developing new\nI-8\nproducts or technologies that will achieve regulatory approval, be developed or manufactured in a cost effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protection or receive market acceptance and we may be unable to recover all or a meaningful part of our investment in such products or technologies. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the size of the markets in which we compete will increase above existing levels or not decline, that we will be able to maintain, gain or regain market share or that we can compete effectively on the basis of price or that the number of procedures in which our products are used will increase above existing levels or not decline.\nAs part of our business strategy, we also pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies and products. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, consummate transactions or obtain agreements with favorable terms. Further, once a business is acquired, any inability to successfully integrate the business, decreases in customer loyalty or product orders, failure to retain and develop its workforce, failure to establish and maintain appropriate controls or unknown or contingent liabilities could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. The integration of an acquired business, whether or not successful, requires significant efforts which may result in additional expenses and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel from other projects. These transactions are inherently risky, and there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful. If we fail to develop and successfully manufacture and launch new products, generate satisfactory clinical results, provide sufficient economic value, enhance existing products, or identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses, technologies and products or if we experience a decrease in market size or market share or declines in average selling price or procedural volumes, or otherwise fail to compete effectively, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nDomestic and foreign legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors and cost containment measures could decrease the demand for products purchased by our customers, the prices that our customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures using our devices.\nOur products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable foreign programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies. In addition, with respect to our durable medical equipment supplier, we also directly bill patients, insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid. Implementation of healthcare reforms or other governmental actions in the United States (such as cuts to Medicare reimbursement) and other countries may limit, reduce or eliminate reimbursement for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and the demand for our products. For example, effective January 1, 2017, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d) introduced performance-based measures and alternative payment models that could significantly impact physician payment. Even when we develop or acquire a promising new product or technology, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors.\nMajor third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare costs through, among other things, the introduction of cost containment incentives and closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, which has resulted in increased discounts and contractual changes impacting healthcare provider charges for services performed. For example, in an effort to decrease costs, certain hospitals and other customers resterilize our products intended for a single use, purchase reprocessed products from third-party reprocessors in lieu of purchasing new products from us or may substitute lower cost products for ours.\nI-9\nFurther legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems (whether governmental or private) in the United States and abroad, or adverse decisions by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement relating to our products, could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or result in the denial of coverage for those procedures. Examples of these reforms or adverse decisions include price regulation, competitive pricing, changes to coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, managed-care arrangements and accountable care organizations. Any of such reforms or adverse decisions resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices or denials of coverage could have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. These outcomes, along with other cost containment measures, could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nAn interruption in our ability to manufacture or distribute our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials or other interruptions of our supply chain may adversely affect our business and/or results of operations.\nWe manufacture our products at, and distribute our products from, facilities located throughout the world, some of which are in areas that are prone to hurricanes and other natural disasters. In addition, our operations (including these facilities or any part of our supply chain) could be adversely affected by pandemics, terrorism or other political, economic or social unrest, environmental factors, strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns, or other disasters or factors beyond our control. In some cases, certain of our key products are manufactured at one facility. If an event occurred that resulted in damage to one or more of our facilities or we experience an interruption or disruption of our supply chain, we may be unable to manufacture or distribute the relevant products at previous levels or at all. In addition, we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers located in various countries. For reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness or availability, most components and raw materials are only available and/or purchased from sole suppliers. While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply, the price and availability of components and raw materials are subject to numerous factors beyond our control, and no assurance can be given that our efforts will be effective. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or materials or do so without excessive cost. As a result, a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution or of our supply chain, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a comprehensive system of federal, state and international laws and regulations, and we could be the subject of investigations, enforcement actions or face lawsuits and monetary or equitable judgments.\nWe operate in many parts of the world, and our operations are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, antitrust, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, fraud and abuse, export control, tax, employment and laws regarding privacy, personally identifiable information and protected health information, including, for example, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), various FDA and international regulations relating to, among other things, the development, quality assurance, manufacturing, importation, distribution, marketing and sale of, and billing for, our products, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Federal False Claims Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the UK Bribery Act of 2010, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and other foreign data protection and privacy laws, and laws and regulations relating to sanctions and money laundering. We are subject to periodic inspections to determine compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation requirements, current medical device adverse event reporting regulations, and similar foreign rules and regulations. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from negligent, reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. The failure to comply with these laws and regulatory standards, allegations of such non-compliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems\nI-10\nwith a product or manufacturer: (i) could result in FDA Form-483 notices and/or warning letters or the foreign equivalent, fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, investigations, detainment, seizures or recalls of products (with the attendant expenses), the banning of a particular device, an order to replace or refund the cost of any device previously manufactured or distributed, operating restrictions and/or civil or criminal prosecution, and/or penalties, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims; and (ii) could disrupt our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nMost of our products must receive clearance or approval from the FDA or comparable regulatory agencies abroad before they can be marketed or sold. State, federal and foreign registration regulations are both evolving and subject to varied levels of interpretation and enforcement. It can be costly and time-consuming to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market a medical device. Approvals might not be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for new devices, new indications for use or certain modifications or enhancements to previously approved products. Even after a device receives regulatory approval it remains subject to significant regulatory and quality requirements, such as manufacturing, recordkeeping, renewal, recertification or reporting and other post market approval requirements, which may include clinical, laboratory or other studies. Product approvals by the FDA and other foreign regulators can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval or may be re-classified to a higher regulatory classification, such as requiring a Pre-Market Approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) for a previously cleared 510(k) device. Regulations are also subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action, which may further increase our costs or reduce sales. Our failure to maintain approvals, obtain approval for new products or comply with other applicable regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nThe healthcare industry is under continued scrutiny from state, federal and international governments with respect to industry practices in the area of sales and marketing, including provisions of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. If our marketing, sales or other activities fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s or other comparable foreign regulatory agencies\u2019 regulations or guidelines, or other applicable laws, we may be subject to warnings from the FDA or investigations or enforcement actions from the FDA, Medicare, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or other government agencies or enforcement bodies. Additionally, in the European Union, a new draft Medical Device Regulation was published in 2016 imposing stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and grants Notified Bodies increased post-market surveillance authority. The Company is monitoring the implementation of the regulation and has undertaken initial actions to move toward compliance based on the published draft of the regulation. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with any marketing or sales regulations or any other applicable regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nIn the recent past, medical device manufacturers have been the subject of investigations from government agencies related to their relationships with doctors, product sales and marketing and off-label promotion of products, among other activities or practices. If an enforcement action involving the company were to occur, it could result in penalties, fines, detainment, seizures, recalls, product bans, operating restrictions (which may include loss of a license or authorization), the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government-funded programs and/or prohibitions on our ability to sell our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. In addition, remediation of any issues identified by the FDA or other regulators could require facility upgrades, process changes, additional labeling requirements or other measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below for a description of the subpoenas and Civil Investigation Demands from a number of State Attorneys General and investigative subpoena from the Department of Defense, in each case, seeking information related to certain of the company\u2019s products.\nIn addition, lawsuits by or otherwise involving employees, customers, licensors, licensees, suppliers, vendors, business partners, distributors, shareholders or competitors with respect to how we conduct our business\nI-11\ncould be very costly and could substantially disrupt our business. Disputes from time-to-time with companies or individuals are not uncommon, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to resolve these disputes on terms favorable to us. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below for a description of lawsuits against the company. The occurrence of an adverse monetary or equitable judgment or a large expenditure in connection with a settlement of any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nFailure to successfully implement, manage and/or integrate critical information systems, disruption of these systems or material breaches of the security of systems involved in our operations may adversely affect our business and customer relationships and/or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems and network infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, including proprietary or confidential information. Our business also generates and/or maintains sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information, which may include protected health information and personally identifiable information (collectively, \u201csensitive personal information\u201d). We also rely on our and others\u2019 technology infrastructure to, among other functions, interact with suppliers and vendors, sell our products, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products and provide support to customers, track customer purchases, fulfill contractual obligations, store data and otherwise conduct business. During 2016, we began (and are continuing our efforts towards) outsourcing significant information technology functions and services to third parties, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result we are managing relationships with third parties who have access to our proprietary, confidential or sensitive personal information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems and those of our third party vendors may make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or attack. Our internal information technology systems, as well as those systems maintained by third-party providers, may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, service interruptions, and cyber-attacks, including infiltration of data centers, any of which, if successful, could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our proprietary, confidential or sensitive personal information and disrupt our operations. The size and complexity of our third-party vendors\u2019 systems and the large amounts of proprietary, confidential or sensitive personal information that is present at their sites also makes them potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, partners or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. We cannot assure you that our vendors, customers and other third parties that we conduct business with will maintain appropriate policies and procedures regarding data privacy and security. Cyber-attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency. Additionally our systems and network infrastructure are vulnerable to interruption due to fire, power loss, system malfunctions and the level of protection and disaster recover capability varies from site to site and across facilities maintained by third-party vendors. While we have invested in our systems and the protection of our data (including through outsourcing certain functions and services to third-party vendors, network monitoring, preventive security controls, employee training and security policies) to reduce the risk of an intrusion or interruption and monitor such systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats, there can be no assurances that the protective measures will prevent attacks or future security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nIn addition, our information systems and those of our third-party providers require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems, and to develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, the evolving needs of our business, regulatory standards and the need to protect our and our customers\u2019 proprietary, confidential or sensitive personal information. If we or our third-party providers fail to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively, fail to implement new systems and/or update or expand existing systems (such as the company\u2019s ongoing effort to expand its Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP, platform more broadly through the company) or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to systems involved in our operations, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, suppliers, vendors, physicians, and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or\nI-12\npenalties imposed, be subject to civil or criminal investigations or suits resulting from a system breach, have increases in operating expenses, have difficulty manufacturing and distributing our products, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of data breaches, have negative publicity or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nWe are substantially dependent on patent and proprietary rights and incur significant costs maintaining, defending and protecting these rights. We also may face restrictions or additional costs in connection with the sale of our products.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation is generally expensive, complex and can result in significant damage awards (treble damages under certain circumstances), injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products, settlement payments or royalty payments to enable us to continue selling the products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. At any given time, we are generally involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incident to our business, we believe that an adverse outcome associated with any pending litigation could generally have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements and other intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary intellectual property and will continue to do so. Although these patents, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements and other intellectual property rights may not successfully protect our intellectual property, we intend to defend against threats to our intellectual property. Our pending patent applications may not result in patents issuing to us, and patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Furthermore, legal standards with respect to the validity and scope of patents continues to evolve and therefore these patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, we operate in foreign markets where protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weaker than in the United States, and inadequate patent protection in those markets may adversely affect our competitive position. Third parties could also obtain patents or other intellectual property rights that may require us to negotiate licenses with them to conduct our business, and we cannot assure you that the required licenses would be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary information and know-how and continuing technological innovation with security measures, including the use of information technology measures and non-disclosure and other agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary know-how.\nAny inability to protect our intellectual property or obtain necessary licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or liquidity. For more information, see Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nOur international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nSales outside the United States accounted for approximately 31% of our net sales in 2016. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales, and we intend to continue our expansion into emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the United States. As a result, our sales and profitability from our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy\nI-13\n(including our plan to continue expanding into emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States) are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country, and include those related to political and economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, enforcement of contractual obligations, ensuring appropriate quality assurance standards, changes to international trade agreements and treaties, local product preference and manufacturing requirements or other trade restrictions, changes in tax laws (including with respect to imports or borders), regulatory and reimbursement programs and policies, import or export licensing requirements and regulations, antitrust enforcement and the protection of intellectual property rights. These risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nThe June 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d) has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the United Kingdom and the European Union. Following the vote, there was significant decline in the value of the British pound compared to the U.S. dollar, and there may be continued volatility in exchange rates and economic conditions as the United Kingdom negotiates its exit from the European Union. Until the terms and timing of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union becomes clearer, it is difficult to predict its impact. It is possible that the referendum and proposed withdrawal could, among other things, affect the legal and regulatory schemes to which our business is subject, impact trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other parties and create uncertainty in the region.\nThe adoption of healthcare reform in the United States may adversely affect our business and/or results of operations.\nIn March 2010, significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were adopted in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d). The PPACA includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose new and/or increased taxes. Specifically, beginning in 2013, the medical device industry was required to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices. This excise tax, which increased our operating expenses, was suspended in December 2015 for 2016 and 2017. The status of the excise tax for sales after December 31, 2017 is uncertain. The tax may continue to be suspended, repealed or may be reinstated at the same or different level. The PPACA also reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and clinical laboratories, which could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which the company sells its products. While the PPACA is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States, other elements of this legislation, such as Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, make it difficult to determine the overall impact on sales of our products.\nIt is possible that changes in administration and policy, including the potential repeal of all or parts of the PPACA could result in additional proposals and/or changes to health care system legislation which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations. The full effect that a full or partial repeal of the PPACA would have on our business remains unclear.\nVarious healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level and in other jurisdictions where we sell our products. The impact of the PPACA (or its full or partial repeal) and these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may impact our supply chain, increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products and/or cause us to incur additional expenses.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, companies registered with the SEC are required to determine the sources of any tantalum, tin, and tungsten (or their ores) and gold (referred to as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d), used in their products and to disclose whether or not the specified minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (\u201cCovered Countries\u201d) and the procedures\nI-14\nemployed to make such determinations. We have determined that certain of our products contain conflict minerals and we have developed a process to identify where such mineral originated. As of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2015 calendar year, we were unable to determine whether or not such minerals contained in our products originate from a Covered Country. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with the diligence and disclosure requirements, and there may be costs associated with remediation and other changes to our products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from our suppliers or that we will be able to determine that all of our products are conflict free. As a result, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement. In addition, we may encounter challenges satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free.\nEconomic conditions and/or instability could adversely affect the company.\nFinancial markets and the economies in the United States and internationally may experience change, disruption and volatility, including the economic impacts resulting from foreign exchange movements. In addition, conditions could worsen in countries that have experienced or are currently experiencing such disruptions or volatility. As a result, the economic environment may, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate downward pressure on the pricing of our products;\n\u2022\naffect the collection of accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nincrease the sales cycle for certain of our products;\n\u2022\nslow the adoption of new technology;\n\u2022\nadversely affect the company\u2019s effective income tax rate;\n\u2022\nadversely affect our customers, causing them to reduce spending and/or decrease utilization of our products; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our suppliers, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products.\nThese conditions may develop or continue in the future. Any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. See Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nWe need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees, including people in technical, information technology, marketing, sales and research positions. Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons with specialized skills, can be intense. Our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location and work environment. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees, our business could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 46877, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "BCR"}
