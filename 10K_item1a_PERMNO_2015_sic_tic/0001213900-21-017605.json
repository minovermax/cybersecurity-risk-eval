{"cik": "1731727", "company": "LMP Automotive Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider each of the following risks, together with all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\u201d, before making a decision to purchase, hold or sell our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock would likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investments. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance.\nWe are a recently formed holding company with a limited operating history. The Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in December 2017. Samer Tawfik, our founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, contributed one hundred percent (100%) of the equity interests in each of LMP Motors.com, LLC and LMP Finance, LLC into the Company in December 2017, and in January 2018, 601 NSR, LLC and LMP Automotive Holdings, LLC made the Company their sole member. Prior to the closing of our dealership acquisitions, LMP Motors.com, LLC, which operates our automobile sales business, and LMP Finance, LLC, which operates our rental and subscription business, were the only subsidiaries that generate revenues 601 NSR, LLC and LMP Automotive Holdings, LLC were formed to enter into future potential strategic acquisitions, but are currently inactive. Because of the uncertainties related to our limited historical operations, including the limited historical operations of LMP Motors.com, LLC, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues or expenses, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of an investment in our common stock.\nWe have a history of net losses.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses at least in the near term as we invest in and strive to grow our business. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including a decrease in demand for automobiles and our related products and services, losses associated with our strategic acquisitions, increased competition, weakness in the automotive industry generally, as well as other risks described in this annual report on Form 10-K, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays in generating revenue or profitability. If our revenues decrease, we may not be able to reduce costs in a timely manner because many of our costs are fixed at least, in the short term. In addition, if we reduce variable costs to respond to losses, this may limit our ability to acquire customers and grow our revenues. Accordingly, we may not achieve or maintain profitability and we may continue to incur significant losses in the future, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of an investment in our common stock.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our initial success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our key employees or senior management, including our founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Samer Tawfik, could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We may not be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe intend to acquire other companies and/or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to the demands of consumers and other constituents within the automotive industry, as well as our ability to respond to competitive pressures. Part of our strategy is to do so through the strategic acquisition of complementary businesses, such as independent and franchised dealerships and vehicle rental companies clustered in key metropolitan areas, and technologies, in addition to our own internal development efforts. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u25cf diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u25cf coordination of technology, research and development, and sales and marketing functions;\n\u25cf transition of the acquired company\u2019s users to our website and mobile applications;\n\u25cf retention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u25cf cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u25cf integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf the need to implement or improve controls, policies and procedures at a business that, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked effective controls, policies and procedures;\n\u25cf potential write-offs of intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect on our operating results;\n\u25cf liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u25cf litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, consumers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our planned acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and otherwise harm our business. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize. Any of these risks, if realized, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe expect that we will require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances. If such capital is not available to us, or is not available on favorable terms, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWhile we used the proceeds from our IPO and follow-on offering for our strategic acquisitions, to build our vehicle inventory, for working capital and other general corporate purposes, we expect that we will require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances, including to increase our marketing expenditures in order to improve our brand awareness, build and maintain our inventory of quality pre-owned vehicles, develop new products or services or further improve existing services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity, debt or other types of financings to secure additional funds. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\nVolatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to risks related to the larger automotive ecosystem, including consumer demand, global supply chain challenges and other macroeconomic issues.\nDecreases in consumer demand could adversely affect the market for vehicle purchases and, as a result, reduce the number of consumers using our platform. Consumer purchases of vehicles generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. Purchases of vehicles are typically discretionary for consumers and have been, and may continue to be, affected by negative trends in the economy and other factors, including rising interest rates, the cost of energy and gasoline, the availability and cost of credit, reductions in business and consumer confidence, stock market volatility, increased regulation and increased unemployment. Increased environmental regulation has made, and may in the future make, used vehicles more expensive and less desirable for consumers. In addition, our business may be negatively affected by challenges to the larger automotive ecosystem, including urbanization, global supply chain challenges and other macroeconomic issues. For example, vehicle rideshare services, such as Uber, Juno, Lyft, and Via, vehicle sharing, and other services that allow people to supplement transit trips and share vehicles are becoming increasingly popular as a means of transportation and may decrease consumer demand for the pre-owned vehicles we sell, particularly as urbanization increases. Additionally, new technologies such as autonomous or self-driving vehicles have the potential to change the dynamics of vehicle ownership in the future. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe participate in a highly competitive industry, and pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe face significant competition from existing and new companies that provide, among other things, automobile listings, information, lead generation, and vehicle buying, rental and subscription services.\nOur current and future competitors may include:\n\u25cf traditional automotive dealerships that could increase investment in technology and infrastructure to compete directly with our online platform;\n\u25cf Internet and online automotive sites that could change their models to directly compete with us, such as Google, Amazon, AutoTrader.com, eBay Motors, Edmunds.com, KBB.com, Autobytel.com, TrueCar.com and Cars.com;\n\u25cf providers of offline, membership-based vehicle buying services such as the Costco Auto Program;\n\u25cf used vehicle dealers or marketplaces with e-commerce business or online platforms such as Carvana, Vroom and Shift;\n\u25cf national rental car companies such as Sixt Rent A Car, Hertz, Avis, Budget and Enterprise, as well as local and regional car rental services;\n\u25cf vehicle subscription services, and other pay-as-you-go services, such as ZipCar and Flexdrive, and similar services offered by large automobile manufacturers such as Volvo and BMW;\n\u25cf other automobile manufacturers that could change their sales models through technology and infrastructure investment; and\n\u25cf Peer-to-peer ride-sharing companies.\nWe also expect that new competitors will continue to enter the online and traditional automotive retail, rental and subscription market with competing brands, business models, products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue, business and financial results. Some of these companies have significantly greater resources than we do and may be able to provide consumers access to a greater inventory of vehicles at lower prices while delivering a competitive online experience.\nOur current and potential competitors may also develop and market new technologies that may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur current and potential competitors may also develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future business model, products and services less competitive, unmarketable or obsolete. For example, manufacturers are beginning to develop automated, driverless vehicles that could eventually reduce the demand for, or replace, traditional vehicles, including the vehicles that we currently sell. Additionally, vehicle rideshare services, such as Uber, Juno, Lyft, and Via, vehicle sharing, and other services that allow people to supplement transit trips and share vehicles, are becoming increasingly popular as a means of transportation and may decrease consumer demand for vehicle ownership. In addition, if our competitors develop business models, products or services with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, it may adversely impact our business.\nOur competitors may also impede our ability to reach consumers or commence operations in certain jurisdictions. For example, our competitors may increase their search engine optimization efforts and outbid us for search terms on various search engines. Additionally, our competitors could use their political influence and increase lobbying efforts resulting in new regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that could prevent us from operating in certain jurisdictions.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources than we do.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and support of their business. Additionally, they may have more extensive automotive industry relationships, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond to changes in the automotive industry more quickly with new technologies and undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. If we are unable to compete with these companies, the demand for our automobiles, products and services could substantially decline. In addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another one of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future providers and suppliers, or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to develop, improve and grow our business. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our revenue, business and financial results.\nOur business is dependent upon access to a desirable vehicle inventory. Obstacles to acquiring attractive inventory, whether because of supply, competition, or other factors, may have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur business requires that we have access to a large number of quality vehicles. We acquire vehicles for sale through numerous sources, including wholesale auction, agreements with manufacturers, independent and franchise dealerships, trade-ins and directly from consumers. The sources from which we can acquire vehicles of a quality and in a quantity acceptable to us are limited, and there is substantial competition to acquire the vehicles we purchase. There can be no assurance that the supply of desirable vehicles will be sufficient to meet our needs. A reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory, including an increase in competition for quality vehicles, could diminish our ability to obtain sufficient inventory at a price that we can reflect in retail market prices and would have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. Additionally, we evaluate potential vehicles regularly using third-party systems to predict mechanical soundness, consumer desirability and relative value of prospective inventory. If we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market trade-in offer trends, or fail to recognize those trends, it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory effectively. Our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition, both from new and used vehicle dealers directly and through third party websites driving appraisal traffic to those dealers.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to expeditiously sell inventory. Failure to expeditiously sell our inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur purchases of vehicles are based in large part on projected demand. If actual sales are materially less than our forecasts, we would experience an over-supply of vehicle inventory. An over-supply of vehicle inventory will generally cause downward pressure on our product sales prices and margins and increase our average days to sale.\nPre-owned vehicle inventory has typically represented, and will continue to represent, a significant portion of our total assets. Having such a large portion of our total assets in the form of pre-owned vehicle inventory for an extended period of time subjects us to depreciation and other risks that may affect our results of operations. Accordingly, if we have excess inventory or our average days-to-sale increases, we may be unable to liquidate such inventory in a timely manner, or do so at prices that would allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and pre-owned vehicles.\nAny significant changes in retail prices for new or pre-owned vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. For example, if retail prices for pre-owned vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles, it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to consumers than buying a used vehicle, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in reduced used vehicle sales and lower revenue. Additionally, manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing the price gap between new and pre-owned vehicles. Pre-owned vehicle prices may also decline due to an increased number of new vehicle lease returns over the next several years. While lower prices of pre-owned vehicles reduce our cost of acquiring new inventory, lower prices could also lead to reductions in the value of inventory that we currently hold, which could have a negative impact on gross profit. Furthermore, any significant changes in wholesale prices for pre-owned vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing our profit margins.\nIf our inventory or other costs of operations increase and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers, we may be unable to maintain or grow our sales margins.\nOur inventory and other costs are variable and dependent upon various factors, many of which are outside of our control. A rise in vehicle acquisition costs could erode our sales margins and negatively affect our results of operations. If we incur cost increases, we may seek to pass those increases along to our customers. However, our consumers typically have limits on the maximum amount they can afford, and we may be unable to pass these costs along to them in the form of higher sales prices, which would adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase margins.\nWe rely heavily on logistics in transporting vehicles for delivery from point of purchase to our facilities, and finally to the customers, via third parties. Our ability to manage this process both internally and through our network of transportation partners could cause a rise in inventory costs and a disruption in our inventory supply chain and distribution. Further, any disruption in the vehicle transport industry or an increase in the cost of transport could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe could be negatively affected if losses for which we do not have third-party insurance coverage increase or our insurance coverages prove to be inadequate.\nWe have third-party insurance coverage, subject to limits, for bodily injury and property damage resulting from accidents involving our vehicles that are rented or subscribed for. We self-insure (that is, we do not have third-party insurance coverage) for other risks, such as theft and damages to vehicles that are rented or subscribed for and are not otherwise covered by renters\u2019 or subscribers\u2019 insurance, and theft and damage to vehicles in our inventory. We account for vehicle damage or total loss at the time such damage or loss is incurred. As a result, we are responsible for damage to our vehicles. A deterioration in claims management, whether by our management or by a third-party claims administrator, could lead to delays in settling claims, thereby increasing claim costs. In the future, we may be exposed to liability for which we self-insure at levels in excess of our historical levels and to liabilities for which we are insured that exceed the level of our insurance. Claims filed against us in excess of insurance limits, or for which we are otherwise self-insured, or the inability of our insurance carriers to pay otherwise-insured claims, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. For example, damages resulting from a significant natural disaster, such as a hurricane, fire or flood, or judgment against us for liability for damages resulting from our rental program could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Should we be unable to renew our commercial insurance policies at competitive rates, this loss could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business relies heavily on our marketing and branding efforts and these efforts may not be successful.\nWe believe that an important component of our growth will be to successfully attract new visitors to our physical locations and our online platform. Because we are a consumer brand, we rely heavily on marketing and advertising to increase brand visibility with potential customers. We intend to execute our sales and marketing efforts by utilizing a multi-channel approach that utilizes brand building, as well as direct response channels in order to efficiently establish and grow both locally and nationally and to increase the strength, recognition and trust in the LMP brand.\nOur business model relies on our ability to scale rapidly and to decrease incremental customer acquisition costs as we grow. If we are unable to recover our marketing costs through increases in customer traffic and in the number of transactions by users of our platform, or if our broad marketing campaigns are not successful or are terminated, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on Internet search engines and social networking sites to help drive traffic to our website and our facilities, and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results or fail to drive traffic through paid advertising, our traffic would decline and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on Internet search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, and social networking sites, such as Facebook, to drive traffic to our website and our facilities. Our ability to maintain and increase the number of visitors directed to our website is not entirely within our control. Our competitors may increase their search engine optimization efforts and outbid us for search terms on various search engines, resulting in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours. Additionally, Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. If Internet search engines modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors\u2019 efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our customer base could decrease or our customer base could decline. Further, Internet search engine providers could provide automotive dealer and pricing information directly in search results, align with our competitors or choose to develop competing services. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website and/or our facilities through Internet search engines could harm our business and operating results.\nThe traffic to our websites and mobile applications may decline and our business may be adversely affected if other companies copy information from our websites and publish or aggregate it with other information for their own benefit.\nFrom time to time, other companies copy information from our websites through website scraping, robots or other means, and publish, or aggregate it with other information for their own benefit. When third parties copy, publish, or aggregate content from our websites, it makes them more competitive, and decreases the likelihood that consumers will visit our websites or use our mobile applications to find the information they seek. While we may try to prevent or limit these activities, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or properly detecting such activities in the future. We may not be able to detect such third-party conduct in a timely manner and, even if we could, we may not be able to prevent it. In some cases, particularly in the case of third parties that operate outside of the United States, our available remedies may be inadequate to protect us against such activities. In addition, we may be required to expend significant financial or other resources to successfully enforce our rights. If any of these activities were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our e-commerce business and failure to successfully manage this business and deliver a seamless online experience to our customers could have an adverse effect on our growth strategy, business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe believe that sales from our e-commerce platform will account for a meaningful portion of our revenues. Our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects are, and we believe will continue to be, dependent on maintaining our e-commerce business. Dependence on our e-commerce business and the continued growth of our direct and retail channels subjects us to certain risks, including:\n\u25cf the failure to successfully implement new systems, system enhancements and Internet platforms;\n\u25cf the failure of our technology infrastructure or the computer systems that operate our website and their related support systems, causing, among other things, website downtimes, telecommunications issues or other technical failures;\n\u25cf the reliance on third-party computer hardware/software providers;\n\u25cf rapid technological change;\n\u25cf liability for online content;\n\u25cf violations of federal, state, foreign or other applicable laws, including those relating to data protection;\n\u25cf credit card fraud;\n\u25cf cyber security and vulnerability to electronic break-ins and other similar disruptions; and\n\u25cf diversion of traffic and sales from our stores.\nOur failure to successfully address and respond to these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact sales, increase costs, diminish our growth prospects and damage the reputation of our brand, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nVehicle subscription is a relatively new business model, and may not be widely adopted.\nWe expect to derive a portion of our revenue from our vehicle subscription service, which is a relatively new and rapidly evolving market. If the market for vehicle subscription fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, our business could be negatively affected. We currently only offer vehicle subscription services in Florida. We intend to expand into markets that we believe are the most likely to adopt vehicle subscription services. However, our efforts to expand within and beyond our existing market may not be successful.\nWe face risks related to liabilities resulting from the use of our vehicles by our subscription customers.\nOur business can expose us to claims for personal injury, death and property damage resulting from the use of vehicles by our subscription customers. For example, a subscription customer may be using a vehicle that has worn tires, a mechanical issue or some other problem, including a manufacturing defect, which could contribute to a motor vehicle accident resulting in serious bodily injury, death or significant property damage for which we may be liable. In addition, since we cannot physically inspect our vehicles after they are delivered to our customers, we depend on our subscription customers and third-party service providers to inspect the vehicles prior to driving in order to identify any potential damage or safety concern with the vehicle. To the extent that we are found at fault or otherwise responsible for an accident, our insurance coverage would only cover losses up to a maximum amount.\nIn addition, in certain jurisdictions, as the owner of the vehicle, there is the potential that we may have vicarious liability for any damages caused by our renters or subscribers, even if we are not found to be negligent. Any such liability may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe anticipate that our business will be highly seasonal and any occurrence that disrupts our activity during our peak periods could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nCertain significant components of our expenses are fixed, including real estate taxes, rent, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other facility-related expenses, the costs of operating our information technology systems and staffing costs. We anticipate that seasonal changes in our revenues will not affect those fixed expenses, which typically result in higher profitability in periods when our revenues are higher, and lower profitability in periods when our revenues are lower. Any circumstance, occurrence or situation that disrupts our activity during these periods could have a disproportionately material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to a significant change in revenue.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our sales, rental and subscription services, and related activities, including the sale of complementary products and services, are, or may potentially be, subject to state and local licensing requirements, federal and state (or local) laws regulating vehicle advertising, state or local laws related to sales tax, title and registration, state or local laws regulating vehicle sales and service, and state laws regulating vehicle rentals and subscriptions. For example, a number of state legislatures are proposing to regulate vehicle subscription programs, and in August 2018, the State of Indiana issued a moratorium on vehicle subscription programs until May 1, 2019.\nOur facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety. In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business, we are subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and NASDAQ listing rules. The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations.\nOur business is subject to the state and local licensing requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate and in which our customers reside. Regulators of jurisdictions in which our customers reside, but for which we do not have an applicable dealer license, could require that we obtain a license or otherwise comply with various state regulations. Regulators may seek to impose punitive fines for operating without a license or demand we seek a license in those jurisdictions, any of which may inhibit our ability to do business in those jurisdictions, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to our advertising, private plaintiffs, as well as federal, state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities, continue to scrutinize advertising, sales, financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of pre-owned vehicles. If, as a result, other automotive retailers adopt more transparent, consumer-oriented business practices, it may be difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other retailers.\nThe foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change.\nChanges in government regulation affecting the communications industry could harm our prospects and operating results.\nThe Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, has jurisdiction over the U.S. communications industry. Under current rules, the FCC regulates broadband Internet service providers as telecommunications service carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act and enforces net neutrality regulations that prohibit blocking, degrading or prioritizing certain types of internet traffic.\nOn February 26, 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet access services in the United States as a telecommunications service subject to some elements of common carrier regulation, including the obligation to provide service on just and reasonable terms, and adopted specific net neutrality rules prohibiting the blocking, throttling or \u201cpaid prioritization\u201d of content or services. However, in May 2017, the FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to roll back net neutrality rules and return to a \u201clight touch\u201d regulatory framework. Consistent with this notice, on December 14, 2017, the FCC once again classified broadband Internet access service as an unregulated information service and repealed the specific rules against blocking, throttling or \u201cpaid prioritization\u201d of content or services. It retained a rule requiring Internet service providers to disclose their practices to consumers, entrepreneurs and the FCC. A number of parties have already stated they would appeal this order and it is possible Congress may adopt legislation restoring some net neutrality requirements.\nThe elimination of net neutrality rules and any changes to the rules could affect the market for broadband Internet access service in a way that affects our business. For example, any actions taken by Internet access providers to provide better Internet access to our competitors\u2019 websites or limit the bandwidth and speed for the transmission of data from our websites, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and may be subject to environmental liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us in the future.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business, including those governing the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances such as motor oil, gasoline, solvents, lubricants, paints and other substances at our facilities. We face potentially significant costs relating to claims, penalties and remediation efforts in the event of non-compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. A failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the laws and regulations to which our business and industry is subject could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent federal legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms may result in an increase in expenses or a decrease in revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, regulates, among other things, the provision of consumer financing. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, a consumer financial protection agency with broad regulatory powers. The CFPB is responsible for administering and enforcing laws and regulations related to consumer financial products and services, including our provision of vehicle financing and our receivables sale facilities. The evolving regulatory environment in the wake of the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the CFPB may increase the cost of regulatory compliance or result in changes to business practices that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe enactment of new laws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations in an unfavorable way may affect the operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, decreased revenues and increased expenses.\nIf we fail to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or the TCPA, we may face significant damages, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe utilize telephone calls and intend to utilize text messaging as a means of responding to customer interest in purchasing, renting or subscribing for vehicles. We generate leads from our website by prompting potential customers to provide their phone numbers so that we may contact them in response to their interest in specific vehicles. We also intend to engage and pay third parties to provide us with leads. A portion of our revenue comes from sales that involve calls made by our internal call centers to these potential customers.\nThe TCPA, as interpreted and implemented by the FCC, imposes significant restrictions on utilization of telephone calls and text messages to residential and mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. Violations of the TCPA may be enforced by the FCC or by individuals through litigation, including class actions and statutory penalties for TCPA violations ranging from $500 to $1,500 per violation, which is often interpreted to mean per phone call.\nWhile we intend to implement processes and procedures to comply with the TCPA, any failure by us or the third parties on which we rely for data to adhere to, or successfully implement, appropriate processes and procedures in response to existing or future regulations could result in legal and monetary liability, fines and penalties, or damage to our reputation in the marketplace, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any changes to the TCPA or its interpretation that further restrict the way we contact and communicate with our potential customers or generate leads, or any governmental or private enforcement actions related thereto, could adversely affect our ability to attract customers and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce or mobile commerce. These regulations and laws may involve taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, consumer protection, Internet neutrality and gift cards. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and consumer privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or e-commerce. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the Internet or e-commerce, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices.\nThough we seek at all times to be in full compliance with all such laws, we cannot be sure that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could damage our reputation and brand, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, decrease the use of our website by consumers and result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any such laws or regulations.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data provided by consumers. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of such information. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain the security of personal and other data that is provided to us by consumers and vendors could harm our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAdditionally, concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business and operating results. There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosing, using and protecting of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and which may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. We generally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. We strive to comply with applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent possible. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules, our practices, or new regulations that could be enacted. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to consumers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others. This also could cause consumers and vendors to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if vendors, developers or other third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put consumer and vendor information at risk and could in turn harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nA significant disruption in service on our website could damage our reputation and result in a loss of consumers, which could harm our business, brand, operating results and financial condition.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract customers depend on the reliable performance of our website and the supporting systems, technology and infrastructure. We may experience significant interruptions with our systems in the future. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, programming or configuration errors, computer viruses, or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the availability of our inventory on our website and prevent or inhibit the ability of customers to access our website. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation, result in a loss of customers and result in additional costs.\nWe utilize cloud computing, or the practice of using shared processing resources at third party locations, to operate our website and e-commerce platform. We do not own or control the operation of these third party locations. These third-party systems, software and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes, and similar events. The occurrence of any of these events could damage our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail.\nProblems faced by our third-party web hosting providers could adversely affect the experience of our customers. For example, our third-party web hosting providers could close their facilities without adequate notice. Any financial difficulties, up to and including bankruptcy, faced by our third-party web hosting providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. If our third-party web hosting providers are unable to keep up with our growing capacity needs, our business could be harmed.\nAny errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance or reliability problems with our network operations could interrupt our customers\u2019 access to our inventory and our access to data that drives our inventory purchase operations as well as cause delays and additional expenses in arranging access to new facilities and services, any of which could harm our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on internal and external logistics to transport our vehicle inventory throughout the United States. Thus, we are subject to business risks and costs associated with the transportation industry. Many of these risks and costs are out of our control, and any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a combination of internal and external logistics for third parties to transport vehicles from point of purchase to our facilities, and finally to the customers. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with the transportation industry such as weather, traffic patterns, gasoline prices, recalls affecting our vehicle fleet, local and federal regulations, vehicular crashes, insufficient internal capacity, rising prices of external transportation vendors, fuel prices and taxes, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified drivers, disruption of our technology systems, and increasing equipment and operational costs. Failure to successfully manage our logistics and fulfillment process could cause a disruption in our inventory supply chain and distribution, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur business model is based on our ability to provide customers with a transparent and simplified solution to vehicle buying, renting and subscribing that we believe will save them time and money. If we fail to build and maintain a positive reputation, or if an event occurs that damages this reputation, it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. Even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could negatively impact results.\nComplaints or negative publicity about our business practices, marketing and advertising campaigns, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide to users, data privacy and security issues, and other aspects of our business, especially on industry-specific blogs and social media websites, and irrespective of their validity, could diminish consumer confidence in our platform and adversely affect our brand. The growing use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and, thus, the speed with which reputation can be affected. If we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information, including information spread through social media or traditional media channels, about us, the vehicles we offer, our customer experience, or any aspect of our brand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur ability to grow our complementary product and service offerings may be limited, which could negatively impact our growth rate, revenues and financial performance.\nIf we introduce or expand additional product and service offerings for our platform, such as services or products involving other vehicles, sales of new vehicles, or vehicle trade-ins, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter these markets successfully. Our expansion into these markets would place us in competitive and regulatory environments with which we are unfamiliar and involve various risks, including the need to invest significant resources and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years, if at all. In attempting to establish new service or product offerings, we expect to incur significant expenses and face various other challenges, such as expanding our customer service personnel and management personnel to cover these markets and complying with complicated regulations that apply to these markets. In addition, we may not successfully demonstrate the value of these complementary products and services to consumers, and failure to do so would compromise our ability to successfully expand into these additional revenue streams. Any of these risks, if realized, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we do not adequately address our customers\u2019 shift to mobile device technology, operating results could be harmed and our growth could be negatively affected.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to provide adequate functionality for visitors who use mobile devices to shop for vehicles and the number of transactions with us that are completed by those users. The shift to mobile technology by our users may harm our business in the following ways:\n\u25cf consumers visiting our website from a mobile device may not accept mobile technology as a viable long-term platform to buy or sell a vehicle. This may occur for a number of reasons, including our ability to provide the same level of website functionality to a mobile device that we provide on a desktop computer, the actual or perceived lack of security of information on a mobile device and possible disruptions of service or connectivity;\n\u25cf we may not continue to innovate and introduce enhanced products that can be suitably conveyed on mobile platforms;\n\u25cf consumers using mobile devices may believe that our competitors offer superior products and features based in part on our inability to provide sufficient website functionality to convince a mobile device user to transact with us; or\n\u25cf regulations related to consumer finance disclosures, including the Truth in Lending Act, may be interpreted, in the context of mobile devices, in a manner which could expose us to legal liability in the event we are found to have violated applicable laws.\nIf we do not develop, upgrade and maintain suitable functionality for users who visit our website using a mobile device, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nOur business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers, including manufacturer recalls.\nAdverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations, which could impact the supply of vehicles. In addition, manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence that have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years. Recalls and the increased regulatory scrutiny surrounding selling pre-owned vehicles with open safety recalls could (i) adversely affect pre-owned vehicle sales or evaluations, (ii) cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory, (iii) cause us to sell affected vehicles at a loss, (iv) force us to incur increased costs and (v) expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe current geographic concentration where we provide services creates an exposure to local economies, regional downturns or severe weather or catastrophic occurrences that may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently conduct business through our corporate headquarters located in Ft. Lauderdale, and our fulfillment and subscription center located in Plantation, Florida. We currently hold all of our inventory at our Plantation location. While we have insurance to cover certain losses on those vehicles, events such as theft, fire, flood, or hail could adversely impact our business. In addition, our business is currently more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and we are vulnerable to economic downturns in those regions. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability. These factors include, among other things, changes in demographics and population. In addition, severe weather conditions, acts of God and other catastrophic occurrences in the area in which we operate or from which we obtain inventory may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to our properties and loss of inventory. Any of these factors may disrupt our business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully replicate our business model and achieve levels of success as we enter new geographic markets.\nWe may rely on agreements with third parties to finance our vehicle inventory purchases. If we fail to maintain adequate relationships with third parties to finance our vehicle inventory purchases, we may be unable to maintain sufficient inventory, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may rely on agreements with third party lenders to finance our vehicle inventory purchases. If we are unable to enter into agreements on favorable terms or at all, or if the agreements expire and are not renewed, our inventory supply may decline, resulting in fewer vehicles available for sale. New funding arrangements may be at higher interest rates or other less favorable terms. These financing risks, in addition to rising interest rates and changes in market conditions, if realized, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is affected by the availability of financing to its customers.\nMany of our customers finance their vehicle purchases. Although consumer credit markets have improved, consumer credit market conditions continue to influence demand and may continue to do so. There continue to be fewer lenders, more stringent underwriting and loan approval criteria, and greater down payment requirements than in the past. If credit conditions or the credit worthiness of our customers worsen, and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in the sales of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information could harm our business and operating results.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, technology and confidential information, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements and certain third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Changes in the law or adverse court rulings may also negatively affect our ability to prevent others from using our technology.\nWe currently hold rights to the \u201clmpmotors.com,\u201d \u201clmprentals.com\u201d and \u201clmpsubscriptions.com\u201d Internet domain names and various other related domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that we believe are important for our business.\nWe may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employees or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while we intend to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property may not be self-executing or the assignment agreement may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may, from time to time, face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering some features, purchase licenses or modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes or may result in significant settlement costs.\nEven if these matters that do not result in litigation are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, our operating results and our reputation.\nOur platform utilizes open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nWe use opensource software in our platform and expect to use opensource software in the future. The terms of various opensource licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our platform. By the terms of certain opensource licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with opensource software in a certain manner, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and to make our proprietary software available under opensource licenses. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an opensource license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, or to re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and services. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of opensource software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as opensource licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with usage of opensource software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on third party technology to complete critical business functions. If that technology fails to adequately serve our needs and we cannot find alternatives, it may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on third party technology for certain of our critical business functions, including vehicle telemetry, network infrastructure for hosting the website and inventory data, software libraries and development environments and tools, services that allow customers to digitally sign contracts, and customer service call center management software. If these technologies fail or we cannot maintain our relationships with the technology providers and we cannot find suitable alternatives, our financial condition and operation results may be adversely affected.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, and we incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that we had not incurred as a private company, and we expect to incur additional costs related to operating as a public company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition, and proxy and other information statements, as well as the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, and the listing requirements of Nasdaq, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. As a public company, we are required to, among other things:\n\u25cf prepare and distribute periodic reports, proxy statements and other stockholder communications in compliance with the federal securities laws and rules and NASDAQ rules;\n\u25cf expand the roles and duties of our board of directors and committees thereof and management;\n\u25cf hire additional financial and accounting personnel and other experienced accounting and finance staff with the expertise to address complex accounting matters applicable to public companies;\n\u25cf institute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance procedures;\n\u25cf involve and retain, to a greater degree, outside counsel and accountants to assist us with the activities listed above;\n\u25cf build and maintain an investor relations function;\n\u25cf establish new internal policies, including those relating to trading in our securities and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u25cf comply with the listing and maintenance requirements of NASDAQ; and\n\u25cf comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe expect these rules and regulations, and any future changes in laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, which have created uncertainty for public companies, to increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases, due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Our investment in compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements will result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also expect that being a public company will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These increased costs may require us to divert a significant amount of money that we could otherwise use to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to various litigation matters from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class actions, by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations, and proceedings or by other entities. These claims could be asserted under a variety of laws, including but not limited to consumer finance laws, consumer protection laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, labor and employment laws, securities laws and employee benefit laws. These actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, and our tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances; or\n\u25cf changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe wording, interpretation and enforcement of existing and future sales, use and excise tax laws by state and local governments could impact sales and income from operations.\nWe are subject to state and local sales, use and excise tax laws of those states and localities in which we have a sufficient tax nexus. As we expand our operations we will likely be subject to more taxing jurisdictions. In that regard, the wording, interpretation and enforcement of those tax laws by such state or local governments could negatively impact our income and sales in such jurisdictions. Because a state or locality\u2019s wording, interpretation or enforcement of its tax laws may change over time, such as through new legislation, the issuance of new rules, regulations or by court or administrative decisions, or merely from new administrative or audit policies or positions, it cannot be predicted whether or to what extent these changes will be negative to our operations and sales in any such jurisdiction.\nAn increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices, with or without notice, that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect transaction taxes such as sales, consumption, value added, or similar taxes. In June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al. held that states can require remote sellers to collect state and local sales taxes, which, given the scope of our anticipated operations, could increase the complexity and risks for us to comply with such laws. We may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly, or at all. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not, could result in substantial tax liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe are also subject to U.S. (federal and state) and foreign laws, regulations and administrative practices that require us to collect information from our customers, vendors merchants, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes and report such information to various government agencies. The scope of such requirements continues to expand, requiring us to develop and implement new compliance systems. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nAny outbreak of contagious diseases, or other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, or other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse effect on businesses, including ours. For example, the coronavirus may negatively affect various aspects of our business, including our workforce and demand for our services, and impact the valuation of vehicles and the demand for vehicles.. An impact to our workforce could impact our ability to deliver our services to our customers and make it more difficult to meet our expectations and obligations. The extent to which our operations will be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, among other things. A health epidemic or other outbreak could materially and adversely affect the global economy, and consequently our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur Founder, Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chairman of the board of directors, Samer Tawfik, beneficially owns a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. As a result, he has substantial voting power in all matters submitted to our stockholders.\nOur Founder, Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chairman of the board of directors, Samer Tawfik, beneficially owns approximately 38.2% of our outstanding common stock. He has substantial voting power in all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including:\n\u25cf election of our board of directors;\n\u25cf removal of any of our directors;\n\u25cf any amendments to our certificate of incorporation or our Bylaws; and\n\u25cf adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us.\nIn addition, Mr. Tawfik\u2019s beneficial stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our Company more difficult, and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that:\n\u25cf permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors or stockholders holding at least 66\u2154% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u25cf provide that directors may only be removed by the majority of the shares of voting stock then outstanding;\n\u25cf require a two-thirds majority of all directors who constitute the board of directors or a 75% majority voting of all holders of common stock to adopt, amend or repeal any and all provisions of our Bylaws;\n\u25cf provide different term limits to the directors of the Company according to their classification;\n\u25cf require 66\u2154% of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in election of directors to amend, alter or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with certain sections of our Certificate of Incorporation;\n\u25cf eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or Section 203. Section 203 generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any holder of at least 15% of our capital stock for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder unless the business combination is, or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder was, approved in a prescribed manner or another prescribed exception applies.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe price of our common stock may decline below the initial offering price of our common stock. The stock market in general, and the market price of our common stock, will likely be subject to fluctuation, whether due to, or irrespective of, our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nOur financial performance, our industry\u2019s overall performance, changing consumer preferences, technologies, government regulatory action, tax laws and market conditions in general could have a significant negative impact on the future market price of our common stock. Some of the other factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in our share price include:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our periodic operating results;\n\u25cf increases in market interest rates that lead investors of our common stock to demand a higher investment return;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf actions or announcements by our competitors;\n\u25cf adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf actions by stockholders;\n\u25cf speculation in the media, online forums, or investment community; and\n\u25cf our intentions and ability to list our common stock on NASDAQ and our subsequent ability to maintain such listing.\nWe are a public reporting company under the Exchange Act, and therefore publicly report on an ongoing basis as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the reporting rules set forth under the Exchange Act.\nWe are a public reporting company under the Exchange Act. We have elected to publicly report on an ongoing basis as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the reporting rules set forth under the Exchange Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other Exchange Act reporting companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make our common stock less attractive to investors, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf taking advantage of extensions of time to comply with certain new or revised financial accounting standards;\n\u25cf being permitted to comply with reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u25cf being exempt from the requirement to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would remain an emerging growth company for up to five years; although, we would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nAccordingly, for so long as we report as an emerging growth company, we will be subject to ongoing public reporting requirements that are less rigorous than Exchange Act rules for companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d and our stockholders could receive less information than they might expect to receive from more mature public companies.\nWe may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the second annual report we file with the SEC. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. However, our auditors will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer a non-accelerated filer or no longer an emerging growth company if we take advantage of the exemptions available to us through the JOBS Act.\nWe are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. As we transition to the requirements of reporting as a public company, we may need to add additional finance staff. We may not be able to remediate any future material weaknesses, or to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls when they are required to issue such opinion, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could harm our stock price.\nWe may not be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on NASDAQ.\nAs our common stock is listed on NASDAQ, we must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain such listing. If we violate NASDAQ listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. If we fail to meet any of NASDAQ\u2019s listing standards, our common stock may be delisted. In addition, our board of directors may determine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ may materially impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock. The delisting of our common stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital and the value of your investment.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will invest future earnings in the development and growth of our business. Therefore, holders of our common stock will not receive any return on their investment unless they sell their securities, and holders may be unable to sell their securities on favorable terms or at all.\nThe preparation of our financial statements involves the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions, and our financial statements may be materially affected if such estimates, judgments or assumptions prove to be inaccurate.\nFinancial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America typically require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Often, different estimates, judgments, and assumptions could reasonably be used that would have a material effect on such financial statements, and changes in these estimates, judgments and assumptions may occur from period to period over time. Significant areas of accounting requiring the application of management\u2019s judgment include, but are not limited to, determining the fair value of assets and the timing and amount of cash flows from assets. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently uncertain and, if our estimates were to prove to be wrong, we would face the risk that charges to income or other financial statement changes or adjustments would be required. Any such charges or changes could harm our business, including our financial condition and results of operations and the price of our securities. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of the accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements and our business.\nIf securities industry analysts do not publish research reports on us, or publish unfavorable reports on us, then the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nAny trading market for our common stock may be influenced in part by any research reports that securities industry analysts publish about us. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities industry analysts. If no securities industry analysts commence coverage of us, the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected. In the event we are covered by analysts, and one or more of such analysts downgrade our securities, or otherwise reports on us unfavorably, or discontinues coverage of us, the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock, or, together, our securities, or the expiration of lock-up agreements that restrict the issuance of new common stock or the trading of outstanding common stock, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and would result in the dilution of your holdings.\nFuture issuances of our securities, or the expiration of lock-up agreements that restrict the issuance of new common stock or the trading of outstanding common stock, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future issuances of our securities, or the future expirations of lock-up agreements, on the price of our common stock. In all events, future issuances of our common stock would result in the dilution of your holdings. In addition, the perception that new issuances of our securities could occur, or the perception that locked-up parties will sell their securities when the lock-ups expire, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In connection with our IPO, the Company entered into a lock-up agreement that prevents it, subject to certain exceptions, from offering additional shares of capital stock of the Company for up to one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of the IPO, as further described in the section titled \u201cUnderwriting.\u201d In addition to any adverse effects that may arise upon the expiration of these lock-up agreements, the lock-up provisions in these agreements may be waived, at any time and without notice. If the restrictions under the lock-up agreements are waived, our common stock may become available for resale, subject to applicable law, including without notice, which could reduce the market price for our common stock.\nFuture issuances of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, and future issuances of preferred stock, which could rank senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividends and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the level of return you may be able to achieve from an investment in our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt securities. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities, and lenders with respect to other borrowings we may make, would receive distributions of our available assets prior to any distributions being made to holders of our common stock. Moreover, if we issue preferred stock, the holders of such preferred stock could be entitled to preferences over holders of common stock in respect of the payment of dividends and the payment of liquidating distributions. Because our decision to issue debt or preferred stock in any future offering, or borrow money from lenders, will depend in part on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any such future offerings or borrowings. Holders of our common stock must bear the risk that any future offerings we conduct or borrowings we make may adversely affect the level of return, if any, they may be able to achieve from an investment in our common stock.\nIf our shares of common stock become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on NASDAQ or another national securities exchange and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock could be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.", "PERMNO": 19139, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "LMPX"}
