{"cik": "1299139", "company": "TearLab Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur near-term success is highly dependent on the success of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System, and we cannot be certain that it will be successfully commercialized in the United States.\nThe TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System is currently our only product. Our product is currently sold outside of the United States pursuant to CE mark approval; in Canada pursuant to a Health Canada Medical Device License; and in the United States as a result of having received 510(k) approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, to market the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System to those reference and physician operated laboratories with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act, or CLIA, waiver certifications. Even though the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System has received all regulatory approvals in the United States, it may never be successfully commercialized. If the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System is not as successfully commercialized as expected, we may not be able to generate revenue, become profitable or continue our operations. Any failure of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System to be successfully commercialized in the United States would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows and could result in a substantial decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur near-term success is highly dependent on increasing sales of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System outside the United States, and we cannot be certain that we will successfully increase such sales.\nOur product is currently sold outside of the United States pursuant to CE mark approval and Health Canada Approval in Canada. Our near-term success is highly dependent on increasing our international sales. We may also be required to register our product with health departments in our foreign market countries. A failure to successfully register in such markets would negatively affect our sales in any such markets. In addition, import taxes are levied on our product in certain foreign markets. Other countries may adopt taxation codes on imported products. Increases in such taxes or other restrictions on our product could negatively affect our ability to import, distribute and price our product.\nOur commitment to purchase minimum levels of product from our suppliers may result in the purchase of excess quantities of product if we are not able to successfully commercialize the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System.\nOn August 1, 2011, we entered into a manufacturing and development agreement, or the Manufacturing Agreement, with MiniFAB (Aust) Pty Ltd, or MiniFAB. Pursuant to the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement, MiniFAB will manufacture and supply test cards for us. The Manufacturing Agreement specifies minimum order quantities that will require us to purchase approximately USD $8.4 million (AUD$10.3 million) in test cards from MiniFAB in 2015. Each year, we must purchase the covered test cards exclusively from MiniFAB until the minimum order quantity for such year has been met. The Manufacturing Agreement has a ten-year initial term and may be terminated by either party if the other party is in breach or becomes insolvent. If terminated for any reason other than a default by MiniFAB, we will be obligated to pay a termination fee based on the cost of products manufactured by MiniFAB, but not yet invoiced, repayment of capital invested by MiniFAB, less depreciation calculated in accordance with Australian accounting standards, and the expected profit to MiniFAB had the remaining minimum order quantities been purchased by us.\nThe usage of test cards purchased under the minimum purchase commitment with MiniFAB is predicated upon significant increases in revenue from the TearLab products as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 and prior periods. If we are not able to commercialize the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System sufficiently to sell the minimum order quantities required by the MiniFab Agreement, we will be required to purchase test cards that we may be unable to use and that may become obsolete, which would have a potentially adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur limited working capital and history of losses have resulted in doubts as to whether we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we have prepared our consolidated financial statements on the basis that we would continue as a going concern. However, we have incurred losses in each year since our inception. Our net working capital balance at December 31, 2014 was $16.3 million, which represents a $18.0 million decrease in the balance from our working capital of $34.3 million at December 31, 2013.\nAlthough current levels of cash flows are negative, management believes the Company's existing cash will be sufficient to cover its operating and other cash demands for at least the next 12 months considering the recent senior term loan agreement providing us access to $35.0 million in gross proceeds including $15.0 million which was received on March 4, 2015\nOur consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if we were not able to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $460 million. Our losses have resulted primarily from expenses incurred in research and development of our product candidates from the former retina and glaucoma business divisions. We do not know when or if we will successfully commercialize the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System in the United States. As a result, and because of the numerous risks and uncertainties facing us, it is difficult to provide the extent of any future losses or the time required to achieve profitability, if at all. Any failure of our product to become and remain profitable would adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.\nWe have outstanding liabilities, which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future research and development needs, and to defend our intellectual property.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total liabilities were approximately $6.4 million. Our significant liability service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. For example, our liabilities present the following risks:\n\u25cf\nour liabilities increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u25cf\nour liabilities could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities, borrow money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies; and\n\u25cf\nour liabilities may restrict us from raising additional funds on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements.\nIf we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our liabilities when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the liabilities, seek to refinance all or a portion of the liabilities or obtain financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nWe may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund our operations.\nSince inception, we have funded our operations through debt and equity financings, including the 2009 convertible secured debt financings, the 2010 private placement and registered direct common stock financings and the 2011 private placement financings, the exercise of warrants in March 2012 by warrant holders, the April 2012 public offering financing,the July 2012 registered direct financing, and underwritten public offering of common stock in July 2013. As of the date of filing of this quarterly Form 10-K, we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our operating activities and other demands for at least the next 12 months considering the recent senior term loan agreement providing us access to $35.0 million including $15.0 million in gross proceeds which was received on March 4, 2015. However, our prospects for obtaining additional financing are uncertain. Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If financing is available, it may not be sufficient for us to continue as a going concern and it may be on terms that adversely affect the interest of our existing stockholders. In addition, future financings could result in significant dilution of existing stockholders and adversely affect the economic interests of existing stockholders.\nWe will face challenges in bringing the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System to market in the United States and may not succeed in executing our business plan.\nThere are numerous risks and uncertainties inherent in the development of new medical technologies. In addition to our requirement for additional capital, our ability to bring the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System to market in the United States and to execute our business plan successfully is subject to the following risks, among others:\n\u25cf\nOur clinical trials may not succeed. Clinical testing is expensive and can take longer than originally anticipated. The outcomes of clinical trials are uncertain, and failure can occur at any stage of the testing. We could encounter unexpected problems, which could result in a delay in efforts to complete clinical trials supporting our commercialization efforts.\n\u25cf\nThe TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System is rated under a CLIA waiver certification which requires our customers to be certified under the CLIA waiver requirements to be reimbursed under Medicare, including certain parallel state requirements. If our customers are unwilling or unable to comply with such requirements, it could have an adverse effect on their acceptance of and on our ability to market the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System in the United States.\n\u25cf\nOur suppliers and we will be subject to numerous FDA requirements covering the design, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, advertising, promotion and export of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System and other matters. If our suppliers or we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System could be subject to restrictions or withdrawals from the market and we could become subject to penalties.\n\u25cf\nEven though we successfully obtained the sought-after FDA approvals, we may be unable to commercialize the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System successfully in the United States. Successful commercialization will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things, achieving widespread acceptance of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System among physicians, establishing adequate sales and marketing capabilities, addressing competition effectively, the ability to obtain and enforce patents to protect proprietary rights from use by would-be competitors, key personnel retention and ensuring sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to support commercialization plans.\nOur business is subject to health care industry cost-containment measures that could result in reduced sales of our TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System.\nMost of our customers rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures which use our TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies, and other health care payers to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payers. If patients cannot obtain third-party payer payment approval, the use of our TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate the use of our system. The cost-containment measures that health care providers are instituting, both in the U.S. and internationally, could harm our ability to operate profitably. For example, managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals. While this type of discount pricing does not currently exist for the medical systems we supply, if managed care or other organizations were able to affect discount pricing for such systems, it could result in lower prices to our customers from their customers and, in turn, reduce the amounts we can charge our customers for our products.\nIf we are subject to regulatory enforcement action as a result of our failure to comply with regulatory requirements, our commercial operations would be harmed.\nWhile we received the 510(k) clearance and CLIA waiver that we were seeking, we will be subject to significant ongoing regulatory requirements, and if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, including:\n\u25cf\nadverse publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u25cf\nrepair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our product;\n\u25cf\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf\ndelay or refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or of new intended uses or modifications to our existing product;\n\u25cf\nrefusal to grant export approval for our products;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u25cf\ncriminal prosecution.\nIf the government initiated any of these enforcement actions, our business could be harmed.\nWe are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or the QSR. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA must determine that the facilities which manufacture and assemble our products that are intended for sale in the United States, as well as the manufacturing controls and specifications for these products, are compliant with applicable regulatory requirements, including the QSR. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections. The FDA has not yet inspected our facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will pass any future FDA inspection. Our failure, or the failure of our suppliers, to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations, a recall of our product, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions, which would significantly harm our available inventory and sales and cause our business to suffer.\nIf we are unable to fully comply with federal and state \"fraud and abuse laws,\" we could face substantial penalties, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including the U.S. Anti- Kickback Statute, physician self-referral laws (the \"Stark Law\"), the U.S. False Claims Act, the U.S. False Statements Statute, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and state law equivalents to these U.S. federal laws, which may not be limited to government-reimbursed items and may not contain identical exceptions. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal and state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws could have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Any action against us for violation by us or our agents or distributors of this act could have a significant impact on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with contractual obligations and applicable laws and regulations governing the handling of patient identifiable medical information, we could suffer material losses or be adversely affected by exposure to material penalties and liabilities.\nMany, if not all of our customers, are covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of August 1996 or HIPAA. As part of the operation of our business, we provide reimbursement assistance to certain of our customers and as a result we act in the capacity of a business associate with respect to any patient-identifiable medical information, or PHI, we receive in connection with these services. We and our customers must comply with a variety of requirements related to the handling of patient information, including laws and regulations protecting the privacy, confidentiality and security of PHI. The provisions of HIPAA require our customers to have business associate agreements with us under which we are required to appropriately safeguard the PHI we create or receive on their behalf. Further, we and our customers are required to comply with HIPAA security regulations that require us and them to implement certain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI, or EPHI. We are required by regulation and contract to protect the security of EPHI that we create, receive, maintain or transmit for our customers consistent with these regulations. To comply with our regulatory and contractual obligations, we may have to reorganize processes and invest in new technologies. We also are required to train personnel regarding HIPAA requirements. If we, or any of our employees or consultants, are unable to maintain the privacy, confidentiality and security of the PHI that is entrusted to us, we and/or our customers could be subject to civil and criminal fines and sanctions and we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers. Under the HITECH Act and recent omnibus revisions to the HIPAA regulations, we are directly subject to HIPAA's criminal and civil penalties for breaches of our privacy and security obligations and are required to comply with security breach notification requirements. The direct applicability of the HIPAA privacy and security provisions and compliance with the notification requirements requires us to incur additional costs and may restrict our business operations.\nOur patents may not be valid, and we may not obtain and enforce patents to protect our proprietary rights from use by would-be competitors. Companies with other patents could require us to stop using or pay to use required technology.\nOur owned and licensed patents may not be valid, and we may not obtain and enforce patents and to maintain trade secret protection for our technology. The extent to which we are unable to do so could materially harm our business.\nWe have applied for, and intend to continue to apply for, patents relating to the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System and related technology and processes. Such applications may not result in the issuance of any patents, and any patents now held or that may be issued may not provide adequate protection from competition. Furthermore, it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged successfully. In that event, if we have a preferred competitive position because of any such patents, any preferred position would be lost. If we are unable to secure or to continue to maintain a preferred position, the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System could become subject to competition from the sale of generic products.\nPatents issued or licensed to us may be infringed by the products or processes of others. The cost of enforcing patent rights against infringers, if such enforcement is required, could be significant and the time demands could interfere with our normal operations. There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical technology industries. We could become a party to patent litigation and other proceedings. The cost to us of any patent litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our would-be competitors may sustain the costs of such litigation more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Litigation also may absorb significant management time.\nUnpatented trade secrets, improvements, confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation are important to our future scientific and commercial success. Although we attempt, and will continue to attempt, to protect our proprietary information through reliance on trade secret laws and the use of confidentiality agreements with corporate partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and other appropriate means, these measures may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information, and, in any event, others may develop independently, or obtain access to, the same or similar information.\nCertain of our patent rights are licensed to us by third parties. If we fail to comply with the terms of these license agreements, our rights to those patents may be terminated, and we will be unable to conduct our business.\nIt is possible that a court may find us to be infringing upon validly issued patents of third parties. In that event, in addition to the cost of defending the underlying suit for infringement, we may have to pay license fees and/or damages and may be enjoined from conducting certain activities. Obtaining licenses under third-party patents can be costly, and such licenses may not be available at all.\nWe may face future product liability claims.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of therapeutic and diagnostic products entail significant inherent risks of allegations of product liability. Our past use of the RHEO\u2122 System and the components of the SOLX Glaucoma System in clinical trials and the commercial sale of those products may have exposed us to potential liability claims. Our use of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System and its commercial sale could also expose us to liability claims. All of such claims might be made directly by patients, health care providers or others selling the products. We carry clinical trials and product liability insurance to cover certain claims that could arise, or that could have arisen, during our clinical trials or during the commercial use of our products. We currently maintain clinical trials and product liability insurance with aggregate annual coverage limits of $2,000,000. Such coverage, and any coverage obtained in the future, may be inadequate to protect us in the event of successful product liability claims, and we may not increase the amount of such insurance coverage or even renew it. A successful product liability claim could materially harm our business. In addition, substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in the incurrence of large expenditures and the diversion of significant resources.\nWe have entered into a number of related party transactions with suppliers, creditors, stockholders, officers and other parties, each of which may have interests which conflict with those of our public stockholders.\nWe have entered intorelated party transactions with our suppliers, creditors, stockholders, officers and other parties, each of which may have interests which conflict with those of our public stockholders.\nIf we do not introduce new commercially successful products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.\nDemand for our products may change in ways we may not anticipate because of:\n\u25cf\nevolving customer needs;\n\u25cf\nthe introduction of new products and technologies; and\n\u25cf\nevolving industry standards.\nWithout the timely introduction of new commercially successful products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time, in which case our sales and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf\nproperly identify and anticipate customer needs;\n\u25cf\ncommercialize new products in a cost-effective and timely manner;\n\u25cf\nmanufacture and deliver products in sufficient volumes on time;\n\u25cf\nobtain and maintain regulatory approval for such new products;\n\u25cf\ndifferentiate our offerings from competitors' offerings;\n\u25cf\nachieve positive clinical outcomes; and\n\u25cf\nprovide adequate medical and/or consumer education relating to new products.\nMoreover, innovations generally will require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine the commercial viability of these innovations and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these innovations. In addition, even if we successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers of each of the key components of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System and are vulnerable to fluctuations in the availability and price of our suppliers' products and services.\nWe purchase each of the key components of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System from a limited number of third-party suppliers. Our suppliers may not provide the components or other products needed by us in the quantities requested, in a timely manner or at a price we are willing to pay. In the event we were unable to renew our agreements with our suppliers or they were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide important components in the required volumes and quality levels or in a timely manner, or if regulations affecting the components were to change, we would be required to identify and obtain acceptable replacement supply sources. We may not be able to obtain alternative suppliers or vendors on a timely basis, or at all, which could disrupt or delay, or halt altogether, our ability to manufacture or deliver the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System. If any of these events should occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in the markets for ophthalmic products and these markets are subject to rapid and significant technological change. Although we have no direct competitors, we have numerous potential competitors in the United States and abroad. We face potential competition from industry participants marketing conventional technologies for the measurement of osmolarity and other in-lab testing technologies, and commercially available methods, such as the Schirmer Test and ocular surface staining. Many of our potential competitors have substantially more resources and a greater marketing scale than we do. If we are unable to develop and produce or market our products to effectively compete against our competitors, our operating results will materially suffer.\nIf we lose key personnel, or we do not attract and retain highly qualified personnel on a cost-effective basis, it would be more difficult for us to manage our existing business operations and to identify and pursue new growth opportunities.\nOur success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and management personnel. In addition, any difficulties in retaining key personnel or managing this growth could disrupt our operations. Future growth will require us to continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, and to continue to recruit, train and retain, additional qualified personnel, which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. The competition for qualified personnel in the medical technology field is intense. We are highly dependent on our continued ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel.\nDue to our limited resources, we may not effectively recruit, train and retain additional qualified personnel. If we do not retain key personnel or manage our growth effectively, we may not implement our business plan effectively.\nFurthermore, we have not entered into non-competition agreements with our key employees. In addition, we do not maintain \"key person\" life insurance on any of our officers, employees or consultants. The loss of the services of existing personnel, the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner, and the loss of our employees to our competitors would harm our research and development programs and our business.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely affect our consolidated operating results, our ability to operate our business and our stock price.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Failure on our part to maintain effective internal financial and accounting controls would cause our financial reporting to be unreliable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows, and could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall dramatically.\nMaintaining proper and effective internal controls will require substantial management time and attention and may result in our incurring substantial incremental expenses, including with respect to increasing the breadth and depth of our finance organization to ensure that we have personnel with the appropriate qualifications and training in certain key accounting roles and adherence to certain control disciplines within the accounting and reporting function. Any failure in internal controls or any errors or delays in our financial reporting would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could have a substantial adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Our management has identified control deficiencies in the past and may identify additional deficiencies in the future.\nWe cannot be certain that the actions we are taking to improve our internal controls over financial reporting will be sufficient or that any changes processes and procedures can be completed in a timely manner. In future periods, if the process required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 reveals material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, the correction of any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies could require additional remedial measures which could be costly and time-consuming. In addition, we may be unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis. Any of the foregoing could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to finance our operations and growth.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future. Such capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, when or as we require additional funding. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that may be convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock, our existing stockholders, would experience further dilution.\nWe expect that we will seek to raise additional capital from time to time in the future. Such financings may involve the issuance of debt, equity and/or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our equity securities. These financings may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all when and as we require funding. Any failure to obtain additional working capital when required would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, our ability to continue as a going concern and would be expected to result in a decline in our stock price. If we consummate such financings, the terms of such financings may adversely affect the interests of our existing stockholders. Any issuances of our common stock, preferred stock, or securities such as warrants or notes that are convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for, our capital stock, would have a dilutive effect on the voting and economic interest of our existing stockholders.\nOur financial results may vary significantly from year-to-year due to a number of factors, which may lead to volatility in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur annual revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from year-to-year. The variability in our annual results of operations may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these annual fluctuations. These fluctuations are due to numerous factors that are difficult to forecast, including:\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in demand for our products;\n\u25cf\nchanges in customer budget cycles and capital spending;\n\u25cf\nseasonal variations in customer operations that could occur during holiday or summer vacation periods;\n\u25cf\ntendencies among some customers to defer purchase decisions to the end of the quarter;\n\u25cf\nthe large unit value of our systems;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our pricing and sales policies or the pricing and sales policies of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nour ability to design, manufacture and deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost effective manner;\n\u25cf\nquality control or yield problems in our manufacturing operations;\n\u25cf\nour ability to timely obtain adequate quantities of the components used in our products;\n\u25cf\nnew product introductions and enhancements by us and our competitors;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated increases in costs or expenses;\n\u25cf\nour complex, variable and, at times, lengthy sales cycle;\n\u25cf\nglobal economic conditions; and\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, we may experience seasonal variations in our customer operations such as could occur during holiday vacation periods. For example, one of our principal target markets consists of private ophthalmic and optometric practices, and our operating results in the quarter ending September 30 of each fiscal year could be adversely affected by summer vacation periods. The foregoing factors, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed due to our manufacturing, research and development, and sales and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. We expect that our sales will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis and our financial results for some periods may differ from those projected by securities analysts, which could significantly decrease the price of our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market prices for, and the trading volumes of, securities of medical device companies, such as ours, have been historically volatile. The market has experienced, from time to time, significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common shares may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials by us, our collaborators and/or our competitors;\n\u25cf\ntechnological innovations or new diagnostic products;\n\u25cf\ngovernmental regulations;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nlitigation;\n\u25cf\npublic concern regarding the safety of products developed by us or others;\n\u25cf\ncomments by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nthe issuance of additional shares to obtain financing or for acquisitions;\n\u25cf\ngeneral market conditions in our industry or in the economy as a whole; and\n\u25cf\npolitical instability, natural disasters, war and/or events of terrorism.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation often follows periods of volatility in the overall market and market price of a particular company's securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.\nBecause we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and have no present intention to pay any dividends in the future. We are not profitable and may not earn sufficient revenues to meet all operating cash needs for at least several years, if at all. As a result, we intend to use all available cash and liquid assets in the development of our business. Any future determination about the payment of dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements, our operating and financial conditions and on such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.\nWarrant holders will not be entitled to any of the rights of common stockholders, but will be subject to all changes made with respect thereto.\nIf you hold warrants, you will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock (including, without limitation, voting rights and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on our common stock), but you will be subject to all changes affecting our common stock. You will have rights with respect to our common stock only if you receive our common stock upon exercise of the warrants and only as of the date when you become a record owner of the shares of our common stock upon such exercise. For example, if a proposed amendment to our charter or bylaws requires stockholder approval and the record date for determining the stockholders of record entitled to vote on the amendment occurs prior to the date that you are deemed to be the owner of the shares of our common stock due upon exercise of your warrants, you will not be entitled to vote on the amendment; although, you will nevertheless be subject to any changes in the powers, preferences or special rights of our common stock.\nWe can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights, and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock. For example, an issuance of shares of preferred stock could:\n\u25cf\nadversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nmake it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us;\n\u25cf\ndiscourage bids for our common stock at a premium;\n\u25cf\nlimit or eliminate any payments that the holders of our common stock could expect to receive upon our liquidation; or\n\u25cf\notherwise adversely affect the market price or our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90488, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "TEAR"}
